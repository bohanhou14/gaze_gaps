You are a trained lawyer from Silicon Valley with a computer science background. Now, you are asked to annotate legal analysis generated by large language models and classify the errors and mismatch made by these models. To produce these legal analysis, a language model will receive the following prompt:

Here are some reference articles for legal cases: 
# Reference case {case_key_1}
{text of cited case 1} 
# Reference case {case_key_2}
{text of cited case 2}
...
# Reference case {case_key_N} {text of cited case N}
Here is the text I’ve written so far: # Paragrah
{previous_text}
Continue to write it following the style of my writeup. Your answer contains 100 to 400 words. You must explicitly use the reference cases and mention their reference ids, i.e. {case_key_1}, {case_key_2} . . . {case_key_N}. Wrap your answer with <answer></answer>. Make your answer concise and avoid redundant languages.

Receiving the prompt above, a language model will generate a paragraph of legal analysis, but often times they make different kinds of errors and mismatches. 

The instructions for you to classify these errors and mismatches are as follows:

You should classify the LLM-generated legal analysis to these categories:

1. Intrinsic gap:
This category refers to generation that is unacceptable, due to the language model has fundamentally failed to follow the instruction, or make a lot of redundancy, or generate something that does not look like legal text (structural mismatch). More specificially, if it makes one or more of the following:

- Redundancy (sentence-level, appearing as neural degeneration): the generation appears to make repetitive statements that do not add more meaning to the analysis. For example, multiple occurences of an exact sentence or phrase.
- Citation Format Mismatch: the generation appears not matching with the citation format of the standard Bluebook.
    - Please be aware that, for example, 440 U.S. 48, 55' is a proper format. Although its full citation should be 'Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979)', the format '440 U.S. 48, 55' is still acceptable as a concise form.
- Structural Mismatch: the generation appears to generate the document from scratch (like containing words such as "ORDER" which only appear in the beginning).
- Stylistic Mismatch: contain sentences that do not match the styles of legalese.

If this type of gaps is present, add the label `1`. Continue to item 2.

Side note: You should be able to classify this purely based on the generation itself, without having to look at cited examples.

2. Target mismatch:

While language model's generated text may be obviously wrong and substantively different from the target (i.e. the original/target text from the case), the claims it makes are still logically and factually sound and can be seen as acceptable. This could be because
 - Chain Cite: the citations appear in a chain cite but the generation cites them parallely, or the other way around.
    - Clarification: "The rule that certain acts of a creditor in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding and during the statutory period for filing proof of claim, may give rise to something equivalent to a proof of claim and afford a sufficient basis for allowing an amendment after the statutory period for filing, was recognized and applied in many cases decided before the 1938 amendment of the Bankruptcy Act. See In re Atlantic Gulf & Pacific S. S. Corporation, D.C., 26 F.2d 751; In re Fant, D.C., 21 F.2d 182; Globe Indemnity Co. of Newark, N. J., v. Keeble, 4 Cir., 20 F.2d 84; In re Coleman & Titus Corporation, D.C., 286 F. 303; In re Roeber, 2 Cir., 127 F. 122." would be a chain cite because all of these citations support the previous claim "The rule that certain acts of a creditor in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding and during the statutory period for filing proof of claim, may give rise to something equivalent to a proof of claim and afford a sufficient basis for allowing an amendment after the statutory period for filing, was recognized and applied in many cases decided before the 1938 amendment of the Bankruptcy Act."
 - Reverse Cite: the citations reverse the ruling in each other but the generation cites them parallely, or the other way around.
 - Compound Cite: the citations of different cases are cited together, separated by semicolons, or the other way around.
 
 Although it does not match with the target, it is still considered somewhat acceptable, but we should label it out.

 If this type of mismatch is present add the label `2`. Continue to item 3.

3. Citation Mismatch: The language model's generated text does not align with the content of the citation it points to. This might be because one or more of the following:

- Claim Hallucination: the claim supported by the citation is not truthful or not related to the context or from cited paragraphs or the previous context. The generated text makes different and possibly (although not necessarily) contradictory claims about one or more citations, which you can check from comparing to the reference case. Or, the generated text attributes information from one citation to a different citation.
- Retrieval Inaccuracy: the claims supported by the citation is not relevant because the cited paragraph looks irrelevant compared to the target paragraph. 
- Citation Hallucination: the citation is non-existent or pulled from a citation in the cited paragraphs or the previous context, or there misses a citation (the generated text fails to use one of the citations that were given to it).

If this type of mismatch is **present**, add the label `3` and move on to the next example. If none of the above errors are present, label '0'.

Here are some examples for demonstration:

In the context of reopening Miss Fowler’s 1968 claim, relevant precedent supports such a measure due to administrative errors. Specifically, in 514 F.2d 561, the court allowed reopening where evidence revealed a clear error on the face of the record. The similarities with Mrs. Lauritzen's case are striking; both involved overlooked evidence and procedural errors. Moreover, 527 F.2d 224 further emphasizes that initial, revised, or reconsidered claims may be reopened if clerical or evident errors are detected.

Applying these principles, we find the Secretary's refusal to reopen Miss Fowler’s 1968 claim to be legally unsupported. The evidence demonstrates errors that warrant reconsideration, thus fitting within the regulatory framework as outlined in the reference cases. Consequently, we remand the case to the Secretary for a substantive review of the 1968 claim, ensuring compliance with the established legal standards set forth in the cases of 514 F.2d 561 and 527 F.2d 224.

target_text: 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8) provides that a final decision may be reopened at any time “for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.” As the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said in Lauritzen v. Wein-berger, 514 F.2d 561, 563 (8th Cir. 1975), the question for the Social Security Administration on any claim for reopening is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, or whether there is manifest error in the record. This inquiry, in opting for a flexible approach to the doctrine of res judicata, supports the view expressed by this court in Coulter v. Weinberger, 527 F.2d 224, 228 (3d Cir. 1975):

The application was denied and then referred, on Mrs. Lauritzen’s request, to an administrative law judge for decision. He stated that he assumed the matter had been referred to him pursuant to 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8).

The hearing officers’ pre-occupation with the claimant’s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider all of the applicable regulations and to overlook a number of other significant factors which would have a bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim. Because of the error of the Social Security Administration in 1959, there was no determination at that time as to whether Coulter was disabled.

previous_text: OPINION OF THE COURT
WEIS, Circuit Judge.
Claimant Merle Fowler is presently disabled by multiple sclerosis. Hampered by the necessity to establish an onset date within her coverage period, she has been unsuccessful in securing disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. Difficulties in proof abound, for the disease is a progressive one, the initial date of disability is seldom easy to determine, and periods of remission are common. And as if these problems were not enough, they were compounded by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare’s loss or destruction of critical records relating to claimant’s first application for benefits. After a thorough review of the case, we conclude the HEW determination that no disability existed on the last day of coverage, June 30, 1966 is not supported by the evidence. Finding adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record, we remand to the Secretary for consideration of Miss Fowler’s request to reopen because of error on the record.
From the early 1950’s on, Miss Fowler worked for various medical schools as a recordkeeper, secretary, and nurse. From 1963 to 1967, she was employed at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. That institution did not participate in the Social Security program and her coverage earned while at other jobs terminated on June 30,1966. Claimant’s testimony before the administrative law judge revealed that it was during her service at U.C.L.A. that she began to encounter increasingly serious and bizarre physical disabilities. These difficulties included: problems in maintaining her balance that were severe enough to attract accusations of being intoxicated or under the influence of drugs; a four-week period during which she had to crawl because of an inability to stand; slurred speech resulting in communication problems with coworkers and patients; difficulty in typing. Miss Fowler was forced to use up all of her vacation time as well as her sick leave because of her illness. Additionally, she often found it necessary to rest over long lunch hours.
Miss Fowler continued to cling to her employment because she was living alone and was her own sole means of support. In February 1967, her condition was such that she could no longer be retained even by the most sympathetic and understanding employer. At about this time her condition was finally diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. She then went to live with her sister in Florida, and for a period of about a year and a half was both bedridden and mentally disoriented. During this interval, her sister filed a disability claim for her with the Social Security Administration, which was rejected, according to the sister, because the claimant did not have enough quarters of coverage.
The claimant enjoyed a period of remission from 1970 to 1973 when she was able to obtain limited employment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but thereafter her disease was again disabling. She filed for disability benefits on March 25, 1974, alleging disability from 1965. After an initial denial, the Secretary referred her case for disability evaluation to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation. That agency, based on information that severe symptoms were observable at some time in 1965 or early 1966, concluded that a closed period of disability was established between December 31, 1965 and February 1, 1970, when remission occurred. The Secretary, however, disallowed the payment of any benefit because the 1974 claim had been filed more than twelve months after the first period of disability had ceased in 1970. See 42 U.S.C. § 416(i)(2)(E). The claimant then requested a hearing, asserting that the 1968 claim filed by her sister had been erroneously denied and should be reopened. On the basis of the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation disability evaluation, claimant believed she was entitled to benefits for the 1965 — 1970 period. The ALJ, however, bypassed the 1968 claim issue altogether, finding instead that there had been no disability before June 30, 1966. The Appeals Council affirmed and the district court ruled there was substantial evidence supporting the Secretary’s decision.
Looking first to the determination of the onset of disability, we conclude that there is not substantial evidence to support the ALJ’s decision.
The claimant’s description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing. She tried desperately to hold her job and exerted extraordinary efforts to cope with her disability. Her case did not rely upon her testimony alone but was supported by several statements from persons familiar with her at that time. A letter from Justine Walker, a coworker, was received into evidence and corroborated Miss Fowler’s account of her difficulties. In addition, the detailed statements of two physicians who were aware of her condition during the period were made part of the record. Dr. Donald A. Adams, her treating physician, stated:
“[Bjeyond question . . . she had multiple sclerosis dating back probably to 1965 and early 1966.”
He said further:
“were she an employee of mine during late 1965 and early 1966 I would have had no other alternative except to terminate her due to her illness even though the consequences would have been that she would be unable to procure another job.”
Dr. Jack A. Cannon, her employer in 1965, said that she should not have been working at that time.
“However, in considering what would happen to her if I did recommend that she be terminated, I had to realize that she would be unable to secure another position because of the problems, and that I could not recommend her for other employment based on her mental and physical condition.”
Her physician at the time of the hearing, Dr. Lawrence D. Ellis, came to a similar opinion after reviewing Miss Fowler’s records. He believed she was unable to engage in substantial gainful employment for a period beginning in late 1965. Moreover, the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation report, which, after careful study, found that disability existed as of December 31, 1965, was totally ignored in the ALJ’s decision. The ALJ did not refer to any of the foregoing evidence, but merely summarized the medical reports relating to the disability period prior to June 30, 1966 as giving “no indication of severe and protracted disability prior to that date.”
This conclusory statement misses the mark on several counts. It fails to observe the appropriate legal standard, whether claimant is unable “to engage in any substantial gainful activity,” 42 U.S.C. §§ 416(i)(l), 423(d)(1), and substitutes a far harsher requirement. Additionally, the statement is directly contrary to the evidence submitted by the physicians familiar with claimant’s condition. In fact, it is not supported by any medical opinion in this case. As we commented in Gober v. Matthews, 574 F.2d 772, 777 (3d Cir. 1978), an ALJ is not free to set his own expertise against that of physicians who present competent medical evidence.
The ALJ’s opinion drew some unsupported inferences from the fact that claimant had been employed by physicians. The ALJ commented, “it is axiomatic that physicians take care of their own.” The thrust of this remark is somewhat obscure because the record indicates the employers did take care of claimant by retaining her for a longer period than that which could be justified by her failing health. To that extent, the “axiom” tends to support Miss Fowler’s claim that she continued to work even though physically incapable of performing the tasks demanded of her. Moreover, her employment after the cut-off date does not foreclose an award of benefits since disability “turns on whether she was disabled within the meaning of the Act notwithstanding the fact that she actually did work.” Stark v. Weinberger, 497 F.2d 1092, 1100 (7th Cir. 1974).
We find it particularly puzzling that the ALJ ignored the findings on disability reached by the state agency to which the Secretary had referred the matter. That expert body made a determination of disability on less evidence than was submitted to the ALJ. Although findings by other agencies are not binding on the Secretary, they are entitled to weight and must be considered. We said in an early case that the evaluation of disability by the Veterans Administration was critically relevant and material in a parallel Social Security ease. Pulaski v. Finch, 415 F.2d 613, 618 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Cutler v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir. 1975); DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92,101 (5th Cir. 1972). And in a case quite similar to the one at bar, Dunbar v. Califano, 454 F.Supp. 1261 (W.D.N.Y.1978), the court expressed disapproval over an ALJ’s failure to consider the disability finding of a state agency consulted by the Secretary.
After careful review of the record, we are convinced that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period, and the Secretary’s determination to the contrary cannot stand. Indeed, absent the question of timely filing, we would enter judgment for the plaintiff at this point.
We must now, then, consider the effect of the 1968 claim. The 1974 application would not be timely if it constituted the original claim because it was filed more than twelve months after the closed disability period terminated in 1970. The claimant, however, asked that the 1974 claim be considered as one requesting a reopening of the original application filed on her behalf some six years earlier.

**Generation:**



In examining the case, we find that the Social Security Administration's determination that no disability existed on the last day of coverage, June 30, 1966, is not supported by the evidence. Reference case 514 F.2d 561 highlights the importance of considering all applicable regulations and overlooking significant factors that may impact the correct adjudication of a claim. In this case, the administrative law judge's preoccupation with the claimant's earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider critical evidence and overlook significant factors that would have bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim.

Furthermore, reference case 527 F.2d 224 emphasizes the need to correct clerical errors or errors on the face of the evidence when reopening a claim. In this case, the claimant's testimony and medical records provide adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record and support the reopening of the claim.

We conclude that the claimant's description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing, and the evidence submitted by physicians familiar with her condition supports her claim. The administrative law judge's opinion misses the mark, and we find that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period.

Therefore, we remand the case to the Secretary for consideration of the claimant's request to reopen because of error on the record. We also note that the claimant's request to reopen the 1968 claim is timely, and we will consider this request in conjunction with the Secretary's decision on the reopened claim.

That expert body made a determination of disability on less evidence than was submitted to the ALJ. Although findings by other agencies are not binding on the Secretary, they are entitled to weight and must be considered. We said in an early case that the evaluation of disability by the Veterans Administration was critically relevant and material in a parallel Social Security ease. Pulaski v. Finch, 415 F.2d 613, 618 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Cutler v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir. 1975); DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92,101 (5th Cir. 1972). And in a case quite similar to the one at bar, Dunbar v. Califano, 454 F.Supp. 1261 (W.D.N.Y.1978), the court expressed disapproval over an ALJ’s failure to consider the disability finding of a state agency consulted by the Secretary.
After careful review of the record, we are convinced that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period, and the Secretary’s determination to the contrary cannot stand. Indeed, absent the question of timely filing, we would enter judgment for the plaintiff at this point.
We must now, then, consider the effect of the 1968 claim. The 1974 application would not be timely if it constituted the original claim because it was filed more than twelve months after the closed disability period terminated in 1970. The claimant, however, asked that the 1974 claim be considered as one requesting a reopening of the original application filed on her behalf some six years earlier.

Furthermore, the claim of non-invention is supported by prior case law which emphasizes the necessity for innovative contribution beyond mere aggregation of pre-existing elements. In reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court determined that a patent merely combining old elements without producing a new function or result was not inventive. Similarly, reference case 106 F.2d 554 reinforces this stance by negating claims that don't advance the existing technical field in a substantive way.

In the present case, Anderson '125's integration of a rotary cutter with spray guns to simultaneously deposit fiberglass and resin fails to constitute a novel invention as defined in these precedents. The combination of these elements, while potentially convenient, does not produce any unforeseen or novel functional results, reflecting the lessons from 219 F.2d 952 and 106 F.2d 554. Thus, the cumulative effect of prior art decisively points to the conclusion that the Anderson '125 patent lacks the necessary inventive step for patentability.

target_text: Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No. 2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise. The method and apparatus claimed by claim 11 of Anderson ’314 “would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * * ” (35 U.S.C.A. § 103) upon perceiving that the strand roving fell to the ground when the operator stopped the machine. “[I]t is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result.” Application of Demarche, 219 F.2d 952, 955, 42 CCPA 793 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 1955). Again, our conclusions in this regard are influenced by the fact that so little time elapsed between the introduction of roving in strands and the application for Anderson’s main patent. Compare Forestek Plating & Mfg. Co. v. Knapp-Monarch Co., 106 F.2d 554, 557 (6 Cir. 1939) (validity of improvement patent upheld in light of prior, repeated unsuccessful efforts).

winding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant’s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof. The Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel. When the thread breaks (or when the tension thereof decreases), the arm drops

This appeal is from judgment for plaintiff-appellee in a patent infringement suit, Ibis Enterprises, Ltd. v. Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court’s findings of fact as follows:
1. Parties
Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida, Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.
2. Civil Action
This is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.
3. Background of Patentee
David F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the “Vidal” process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: “hand lay-up” and “matched die (or metal) mold” (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).
4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method
The “Vidal” process involved, in part, the “hand lay-up” process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the “Vidal” process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).
5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method
(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called “matched metal mold” or “matched die” process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).
(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).
6. Anderson Early Work and Invention
(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the “matched metal mold” process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *
7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125
(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;
“the depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.” (Column 2, lines 39-52).
The form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).
(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:
“The present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.” (Column 1, lines 55-65).
'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed ■only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim ■6). * * ■*
11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit
(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).
(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff’s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend “Patented Process” while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs’ Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *
Yj * * *
(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).
(b) In the Defendant’s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).
18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs’
Each of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).
At this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the “clearly erroneous” limitation.
Second, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of “primary,” as opposed to “ultimate” fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).
Third, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court’s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court’s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.
Fourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. § 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.
Directing our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the “rather severe test” promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?” Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to “scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.” Ibid.
In light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson’s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.
As the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general — problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the “clearly erroneous” limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.
It is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson’s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson’s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).
Pursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson’s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of “obviousiness” and “newness” of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes — both relating to the making of pre-form — combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).
The final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson’s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at
143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, “in that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.” (Anderson deposition at 117).
A discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court’s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court’s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had “abandoned” its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility’s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson’s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.
Although certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson’s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.
The California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson’s case for improvement over the prior art as being “limited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.” Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).
Having thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson’s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention — subjecting Anderson ’125 to the “rather severe test” outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson ’125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of “obviousness” of the Anderson combination.
While it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus “occurred to me the moment I saw the roving.” (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or ’51, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson ’125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson’s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson’s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).
From this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson ’125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. § 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining “obviousness” under 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve — the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .
To summarize, the Anderson ’125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements “perform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that
“patentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun — a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.”
Our conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson ’125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.
Implicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.

In the context of patent infringement, the concept of obviousness is crucial in determining the validity of a patent. The court needs to consider whether a person of ordinary skill in the field would have arrived at the claimed invention without resorting to inventive ingenuity. In the case of Anderson's patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.

In the reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court held that the patent in question did not meet the requirements of patentability because it was obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field. Similarly, in the reference case 106 F.2d 554, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.

In the case of Anderson's patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious because it was a combination of old elements that were well-known in the field. The court noted that the prior art references, such as the Thompson and Lampe patents, showed that the simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder was already known. The court also noted that the use of a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid was also known in the prior art.

Furthermore, the court found that the claimed invention did not have any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements. The court noted that the materials used in the prior art references did not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics, but the court still found that the prior art references were relevant to the issue of obviousness.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Anderson's patents was influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The court's finding of obviousness was based on the combination of old elements that were well-known in the field, and the court did not find any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements.

target_text: Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No. 2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise. The method and apparatus claimed by claim 11 of Anderson ’314 “would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * * ” (35 U.S.C.A. § 103) upon perceiving that the strand roving fell to the ground when the operator stopped the machine. “[I]t is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result.” Application of Demarche, 219 F.2d 952, 955, 42 CCPA 793 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 1955). Again, our conclusions in this regard are influenced by the fact that so little time elapsed between the introduction of roving in strands and the application for Anderson’s main patent. Compare Forestek Plating & Mfg. Co. v. Knapp-Monarch Co., 106 F.2d 554, 557 (6 Cir. 1939) (validity of improvement patent upheld in light of prior, repeated unsuccessful efforts).

winding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant’s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof. The Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel. When the thread breaks (or when the tension thereof decreases), the arm drops

This appeal is from judgment for plaintiff-appellee in a patent infringement suit, Ibis Enterprises, Ltd. v. Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court’s findings of fact as follows:
1. Parties
Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida, Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.
2. Civil Action
This is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.
3. Background of Patentee
David F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the “Vidal” process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: “hand lay-up” and “matched die (or metal) mold” (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).
4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method
The “Vidal” process involved, in part, the “hand lay-up” process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the “Vidal” process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).
5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method
(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called “matched metal mold” or “matched die” process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).
(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).
6. Anderson Early Work and Invention
(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the “matched metal mold” process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *
7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125
(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;
“the depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.” (Column 2, lines 39-52).
The form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).
(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:
“The present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.” (Column 1, lines 55-65).
'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed ■only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim ■6). * * ■*
11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit
(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).
(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff’s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend “Patented Process” while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs’ Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *
Yj * * *
(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).
(b) In the Defendant’s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).
18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs’
Each of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).
At this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the “clearly erroneous” limitation.
Second, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of “primary,” as opposed to “ultimate” fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).
Third, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court’s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court’s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.
Fourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. § 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.
Directing our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the “rather severe test” promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?” Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to “scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.” Ibid.
In light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson’s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.
As the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general — problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the “clearly erroneous” limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.
It is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson’s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson’s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).
Pursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson’s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of “obviousiness” and “newness” of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes — both relating to the making of pre-form — combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).
The final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson’s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at
143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, “in that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.” (Anderson deposition at 117).
A discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court’s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court’s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had “abandoned” its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility’s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson’s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.
Although certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson’s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.
The California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson’s case for improvement over the prior art as being “limited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.” Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).
Having thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson’s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention — subjecting Anderson ’125 to the “rather severe test” outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson ’125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of “obviousness” of the Anderson combination.
While it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus “occurred to me the moment I saw the roving.” (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or ’51, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson ’125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson’s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson’s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).
From this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson ’125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. § 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining “obviousness” under 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve — the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .
To summarize, the Anderson ’125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements “perform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that
“patentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun — a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.”
Our conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson ’125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.
Implicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.

This stringent interpretation contrasts sharply with the intent of the 1963 amendments to Rule 25 and Rule 6(b), which aimed to inject flexibility and fairness into the substitution process. As noted in 379 F.2d 94 and 359 F.2d 292, the amendments were designed to eliminate the inequities and hardships caused by the rigid two-year limitation originally imposed. The Advisory Committee emphasized that the revised rules were to be liberally construed to allow courts discretion in extending the substitution period, recognizing the difficulties that could arise in promptly identifying and notifying the proper representative of the deceased. 

Given this context, the defendant’s counsel's suggestion of death, which lacked identification of a proper representative, failed to initiate the 90-day countdown. This interpretation aligns with the judicial precedent that courts should prioritize the equitable administration of justice over strict procedural formalities. Thus, the district court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs' action without granting the requested extension, especially considering the circumstances that inhibited timely substitution, such as the injury to plaintiffs' counsel and the ongoing legal processes in the probate court.

We, therefore, reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, ensuring that the substitution process adheres to the flexible and just principles intended by the amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

previous_text: LEVENTHAL, Circuit Judge:
The District Court held that Rule 25(a) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure required dismissal of the plaintiffs’ tort action because defendant’s counsel had filed a suggestion of death of the defendant yet plaintiff had not made any substitution of parties within 90 days. We reverse on the ground that the suggestion of death, which was neither filed by nor identified a successor or representative of the deceased, such as an executor or administrator, was ineffective to trigger the running of the 90-day period provided by the Rule.
Mr. and Mrs. John Rende filed an action in the District Court individually and on behalf of their infant son who had been struck and injured by Alfred S. Kay while driving his car. On August 27, 1967, defendant Kay died. On September 1, 1967, the defendant’s attorney, a term used here to identify the lawyer who had been retained by deceased to defend the action, and who had duly entered an appearance as attorney for defendant, filed a suggestion of death in the District Court, giving notice to plaintiffs’ attorney. That same day there was filed in the Orphans Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, residence of the deceased, his will naming his widow as executrix, but the will had not been probated, nor any legal representative appointed for the estate at the time of the filing of this appeal.
Plaintiffs’ attorney was injured on October 14, 1967. On returning to practice early in 1968, he learned that no successor to defendant Kay had yet been appointed, and he moved to certify the case to the ready calendar. The defendant’s attorney opposed this on grounds that discovery procedures had not been completed. The case was delayed and placed on the ready calendar as of June 7, 1968.
However, in April 1968, the defendant’s attorney moved in his own name to dismiss the action on the ground that Rule 25(a) (1) required plaintiffs to move to substitute a proper party for the deceased within 90 days of the suggestion of death. Plaintiffs filed an opposition and motion for substitution of the proper party, and sought an extension of the time for substitution as allowed by Rule 6(b). At argument, plaintiffs’ counsel asserted the “suggestion of death was defective in that it did not list the name of the proper party; that is the legal representative of the defendant.” The court responded: “That would not be his burden.” The court dismissed the action with prejudice.
Prior to its amendment in 1963, Rule 25(a) (1) required the court to dismiss a case if no motion for substitution was filed within two. years after date of death, and no extensions of this period were allowed under Rule 6(b). The rule was rigorously applied, often with harsh results, and was called “easily the poorest rule of all the Federal Rules.” In 1955 the Advisory Committee on Rules for Civil Procedure recommended that the two-year period be changed to a “reasonable time” standard. In 1961 the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules again suggested the Rule be made more flexible. In 1963 the Supreme Court made changes in Rule 25(a) (1) and in Rule 6(b) so as to provide a 90-day time limit from the filing of a suggestion of death, and to give the court discretion to extend that time.
The Committee Notes explaining the amendments state:
Present Rule 25(a) (1), together with present Rule 6(b), results in an inflexible requirement that an action be dismissed as to a deceased party if substitution is not carried out within a fixed period measured from the time of death. The hardships and inequities of this unyielding requirement plainly appear from the cases. * * * The amended rule establishes a time limit for the motion to substitute based not upon the time of the death, but rather upon the time information of the death is provided by means of a suggestion of death upon the record. * * * A motion to substitute may be made by any party or by the representative of the deceased party without awaiting the suggestion of death. Indeed, the motion will usually be so made. If a party or the representative of the deceased party desires to limit the time within which another may make the motion, he may do so by suggesting the death upon the record. (Emphasis added.)
Under the amended Rule either a party or “the successors or representatives of the deceased party” may avoid delay in effecting substitution for the deceased party either by filing a motion for substitution or by suggesting death on the record and thus triggering the 90-day period which begins with suggestion of death.
The Advisory Committee, in outlining that suggestion of death could be made by “the representative of the deceased party” plainly contemplated that the suggestion emanating from the side of the deceased would identify a representative of the estate, such as an executor or administrator, who could be substituted for the deceased as a party, with the action continued in the name of the representative. The addition of “successor” in the Rule would take care of the case of, say, the distributee of an estate that had been distributed, but would not make a material difference in the aspect under consideration. Form 30, for suggestion of death, which was provided in order to expedite and facilitate implementation of the amendment, provides:
A.B. [described as a party, or as executor, administrator, or other representative or successor of C.D., the deceased party\ suggests upon the record, pursuant to Rule 25(a) (1), the death of C.D. [describe as party] during the pendency of this action. Added Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963. [Emphasis added.]
Although the attorney for the defendant was retained to “represent” the deceased as his counsel, he is not a person who could be made a party, and is not a “representative of the deceased party” in the sense contemplated by Rule 25(a) d).
In our opinion the Rule, as amended, cannot fairly be construed, as the de fendant’s attorney argues, to make his suggestion of death operative to trigger the 90-day period even though he was neither a successor nor representative of the deceased, and gave no indication of what person was available to be named in substitution as a representative of the deceased. Counsel’s construction would open the door to a tactical maneuver to place upon the plaintiff the burden of locating the representative of the estate within 90 days.
We can conceive of cases wherein even the lawyer retained to represent a defendant might know the defendant had died, yet not readily know where his estate would be administered. In the present case, plaintiff’s attorney did know the court of probate, but he did not know whether probate of the will might be contested, or who would be appointed representative of the estate. The tactic of the defendant’s attorney would place on plaintiff the burden, where no conventional representative was appointed for the estate in probate court, of instituting machinery in order to produce some representative of the estate ad litem, pending appointment of the representative contemplated by law of the domicile of the deceased.

**Generation:**

In the context of Rule 25(a) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the suggestion of death is a crucial step in the process of substituting a deceased party with a proper representative. However, not all suggestions of death are created equal. In cases where the suggestion of death is made by a party's attorney, but fails to identify a successor or representative of the deceased, the 90-day period for substitution may not be triggered.

As noted in 359 F.2d 292, the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules intended to provide a more flexible standard for substitution, allowing for extensions of time and dispensing with the rigid two-year period previously in place. However, this flexibility is contingent upon the suggestion of death providing sufficient information to permit the court to proceed with substitution.

In the present case, the suggestion of death made by the defendant's attorney was deficient in that it failed to identify a successor or representative of the deceased. This lack of specificity rendered the suggestion ineffective in triggering the 90-day period for substitution, as explained in 379 F.2d 94.

Furthermore, the court's discretion to enlarge the time period for substitution, as provided by Rule 6(b), is not a blank check. Rather, it is intended to be exercised in a judicious and reasonable manner, taking into account the particular circumstances of each case.

In light of these principles, we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the action with prejudice. The case should be remanded for further proceedings, allowing the parties to properly substitute a representative of the deceased and continue the action in a manner consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

In considering the objections to the magistrate's report, it is crucial to reference the Federal Magistrate’s Act, 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), which has been extensively interpreted in several cases. As highlighted in 616 F.2d 603 and 678 F.2d 376, any party may serve and file written objections to the magistrate's proposed findings and recommendations within ten days, allowing a judge to make a de novo determination of contested portions.

In the case at hand, the magistrate directed that objections should be filed within ten days, paralleling the procedure noted in 474 U.S. 140, where failure to file timely objections can result in waiver of the right to appeal. Despite the potential for review sua sponte by the district judge, as occurred in 474 U.S. 140, such a provision underscores the importance of adhering to procedural rules.

Therefore, in alignment with judicial precedents (616 F.2d 603, 678 F.2d 376, 474 U.S. 140), this court adopts the magistrate’s report and recommendations. Consequently, the claims in Count I are adequately detailed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), and further discovery will entail a comprehensive review post-pretrial, ensuring due process and judicial economy.

Report and recommendation of the magistrate is adopted.

Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. (Emphasis suppl.) Basically, the dispute between the parties centers upon the effect of the phrase “may serve and file written objections.” Defendants assert that a party may decide not to file, but that filing is obligatory if he is dissatisfied. Plaintiffs’ position is that the district court has a duty to review the magistrate’s recommendations in any event, and that the losing party need file objections only if he wishes a hearing. Although the court cited its Local Rule 7(c), this rule is of no assistance. Other than referring to the statute itself, it is limited to “appeal[s]” from orders under subsection (b)(1)(A). We turn, accordingly, to the statute. There are three possible areas of consideration: the statutory language, the statutory purpose, and the legislative history. First, plaintiffs point to the

Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. The judge may also receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate with instructions. (B) a judge may also designate a magistrate to conduct hearings, including evi-dentiary hearings, and to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition, by a judge of the court, of any motion excepted in subparagraph (A), of applications for posttrial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses and of prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement.

The last page of the Magistrate’s report contained the prominent legend: “ANY OBJECTIONS to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of Courts within ten (10) days of receipt of this notice. Failure to file objections within the specified time waives the right to appeal the District Court’s order. See: United States v. Walters, 638 F. 2d 947 (6th Cir. 1981).” Despite this clear notice, petitioner failed to file objections at any time. She sought and received an extension of time to file objections through June 15, 1982, on the grounds that “this case entails many substantive issues and counsel needs more time to write his brief.” However, petitioner made no further submissions on the merits to the District Court.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT (# 29)
Feb. 27, 1989.
ROBERT B. COLLINGS, United States Magistrate.
Terry Howard, Byron Roseman and Frederick Wikander are three Massachusetts physicians who were trustees of Medical Associates, a Massachusetts business trust. Chelmsford Medical Associates, Inc., a professional corporation, is alleged to be the successor-in-interest of Medical Associates.
The instant case arises out of agreements reached whereby the defendant would sell and grant certain licenses respecting a computer system for use by the business trust. The Second Amended Complaint contains claims for intentional or negligent misrepresentation (Count I), breach of contract (Count II), breach of warranties (Count III), negligence/computer malpractice (Count IV) and unfair or deceptive acts and practices (Count V). Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.
I RECOMMEND that all but one of the grounds listed in the Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss The Amended Complaint (# 29) be DEFERRED for resolution at the PreTrial Conference when discovery has been completed. See Rule 12(d), Fed.R.Civ.P. The reason for this recommendation is that the defendant does not assert that all of the claims in the Second Amended Complaint (as opposed to the Amended Complaint) are subject to dismissal. Specifical ly, to the extent that Count II of the Second Amended Complaint contains a claim by plaintiffs Howard, Roseman and Wikander for breach of contract, defendant does not contend that Count II is subject to dismissal. Since the case will go forward on that claim regardless of whether the other claims are dismissed and since the scope of discovery would be approximately the same regardless of whether or not the other claims are dismissed at this time, it seems to me in the interests of judicial economy to defer the motion to dismiss the other claims until after the issues respecting those claims have been sharpened by the discovery process.
The one exception is the claim that the counts sounding in fraud and misrepresentation are not pleaded with the particularity required by Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. This type of issue should not be deferred.
This is not the first time I have reviewed plaintiffs’ pleadings to determine if the allegations of fraud have complied with Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. On February 12, 1988,1 issued a Memorandum (# 20) indicating that although the content of the misrepresentations was adequately pleaded, the pleadings were defective because of the failure to state the time and place of the alleged misrepresentations.
In the Amended Complaint (# 26) and in the Second Amended Complaint (# 62), plaintiffs have sought to rectify this deficiency. They claim they have done so; defendant disagrees.
Count I of the Second Amended Complaint alleging misrepresentation is divided into two parts. The first deals with misrepresentations allegedly made before the parties entered into a written contract; the second deals with misrepresentations made after the written contract was signed.
Paragraph 34 concerns misrepresentations made before the contract was signed and reads as follows:
34. To induce Chelmsford Medical Associates to enter into the Systems Purchase Agreement, Cycare falsely represented the features, performance and quality of the system and the nature and quality of Cycare’s support services, and falsely represented the benefits to Chelmsford Medical Associates of using the system. Specifically, and without limitation, Cycare made the representations as described in paragraph 11, above.
Paragraph 11 contains twelve subparts (a through 1) which list “representations” allegedly made. After each of the subparts, a “specification” of time and place is set forth in parentheses. The “specifications” are similar. Examples are:
a. (This representation was made during the one-site demonstration and in documentation.)”
c. “... (This representation was made in the on-site and off-site demonstrations, during the on-site visits and during telephone discussions between the parties.)”
g. “... (These representations were made during the on-site and off-site demonstrations, during the on-site visits and in the Written Proposal and in the documentation.)”
Paragraph 8 contains dates and places of a number of these events. The on-site demonstration occurred at the plaintiffs’ offices on May 23-24, 1985. The “Written Proposal” was made on or about June 24, 1985. The “off-site” demonstration occurred on June 26-27, 1985 at Memphis, Tennessee. It is further alleged that “additional on-site visits by Cycare to Chelmsford [occurred] during the period July-September, 1985.” Lastly, it is alleged that the telephone conversations occurred between May, 1985 and the date of the execution of the written contract, i.e., September 30, 1985.
The second group of alleged misrepresentations is alleged to have occurred after September 30,1985. Paragraphs 35 and 36 of the Second Amended Complaint read as follows:
35. To induce Chelmsford Medical Associates to continue to use a defective system, CyCare falsely represented that it could and would remedy the malfunctions and problems with the computer system. These representations were made beginning in approximately March, 1986 when the first computer run was made on the CyCare system, and continued to be made up to and including June, 1987. These representations were made by CyCare while present at Chelmsford Medical Associates’ site, including but not limited to meetings in March 1986, April 1986, July 1986, October 1986 and March 1987 and in telephone conversations throughout the period, including but not limited to the following correspondence:
a. letter dated August 6, 1986 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
b. letter dated August 21, 1986 from David Bennett to Alan Carr-Locke;
c. letter dated September 24, 1986 from David Bennett to Alan Carr-Locke;
d. letter dated October 13, 1986 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
e. letter dated October 25, 1986 from Lorraine Hess to Alan Carr-Locke;
f. letter dated March 30, 1987 from Lorraine Hess to Dick Farrar;
g. letter dated April 6, 1987 from Daniel A. Wolfe to Diane Richards;
h. letter dated April 22, 1987 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
i. letter dated May 22, 1987 from Daniel A. Wolfe to Byron Roseman, M.D.
The resolution of whether plaintiffs have now complied with Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ. P., is governed by the five most recent First Circuit cases construing Rule 9(b), Fed.R. Civ.P., i.e. McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., 633 F.2d 226, 228 (1 Cir.,1980); Wayne v. Gulf Oil Corp., 739 F.2d 11 (1 Cir.,1984); Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., 754 F.2d 430 (1 Cir.,1985); Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441 (1 Cir.,1985) and New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, 829 F.2d 286 (1 Cir.,1987).
In McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., the Court wrote:
The clear weight of authority is that Rule 9 requires specification of time, place and content of an alleged false representation but not the circumstances or evidence from which fraudulent intent could be inferred, [citations omitted] This interpretation of Rule 9 comports with its language, harmonizes the rule with Rule 8, which requires that averments in pleadings be concise and direct, and at the same time fulfills a major purpose of Rule 9: to give adequate notice of the plaintiff’s claim of fraud or mistake, [citations omitted]
Id., 633 F.2d at 228-29.
In Wayne v. Gulf Oil Corp., the Court added “... that allegations based on ‘information and belief' do not satisfy the particularity requirement unless the complaint sets forth the facts on which the belief is founded ... and that the requirement that supporting facts be pleaded applies even when the fraud relates to matters within the knowledge of the opposing party.” Id., 739 F.2d at 13-14.
In Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., the Court noted that the “purpose of the rule [9(b) ] is to protect the defendant from unfair surprise and to discourage ‘strike suits.’ ” Id., 754 F.2d at 439. In addition, the Court wrote:
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(f) provides that “all pleadings shall be construed so as to do substantial justice.” Considered as a whole, we find that the facts and circumstances pleaded in the complaint were sufficient to give notice to [the defendant] of the nature of the claims against it and find no error in the district court’s consideration of fraud, [citation omitted]
Id. at 440.
In Hayduk v. Lanna, the Court wrote:
One of the main purposes of [Rule 9(b) ] is to apprise the defendant of fraudulent claims and of the acts which form the basis of the claim, [citations omitted] In other words, ‘[i]n cases in which fraud lies at the core of the action, the rule does not permit a complainant to file suit first, and subsequently to search for a cause of action.’ Lopez v. Bulova Watch Co., Inc., 582 F.Supp. 755, 766 (D.R.I.1984) (citing Deyhle v. Barclay Investments, Inc., No. 82-0662, slip op. at 4 (D.R.I. Oct. 13, 1983)) (emphasis added).
Id., 775 F.2d at 443.
Lastly, in New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, the Court considered the applicability of Rule 9(b) to predicate acts of mail and wire fraud which were pleaded in a RICO claim. The Court held that “Rule 9(b) requires specificity in the pleading of RICO mail and wire fraud [and] [t]his degree of specificity is no more nor less than we have required in fraud and securities fraud cases.” Id., 829 F.2d at 290 (citations omitted). In so holding, the Court wrote that:
Generally, there are three purposes behind Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirement: (1) to place the defendants on notice and enable them to prepare meaningful responses; (2) to preclude the use of a groundless fraud claim as a pretext to discovering a wrong or as a “strike suit”; and (3) to safeguard defendants from frivolous charges which might damage their reputations, [citations omitted]
Id., 829 F.2d at 289.
The Court specifically noted that in determining whether Rule 9(b) is satisfied, a Court must “keep in mind” these three major purposes of Rule 9(b).
Applying these principles to the case at bar, it becomes apparent that the Second Amended Complaint complies with the provisions of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. Therefore, I RECOMMEND that Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss The Amended Complaint (# 29) be deemed to seek dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint and that to the extent that the motion seeks dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint on the ground that it fails to plead fraud and misrepresentation with the requisite degree of particularity, the motion be DENIED.
First, all but two of the misrepresentations alleged in paragraph 11 (made before the written contract was executed) are alleged to have been made at either the “on-site demonstration” or the “off-site demonstration” or both. The dates and places of both the “on-site demonstration” and the “off-site demonstration” are stated with particularity in paragraph 8. The other two misrepresentations are alleged to have been made at “on-site visits.” Since “on-site” refers to the plaintiffs’ business premises, the place of the misrepresentations is pleaded with particularity. The time is specified in paragraph 8 as being within the three months period from July through September, 1985. In the circumstances, I view this as sufficient particularity.
Second, each of the alleged misrepresentations made after the written contract was signed are alleged to have been made in nine pieces of correspondence which are listed by date, sender, and recipient in paragraph 35 of the Second Amended Complaint. This is sufficient particularity as to time and place for the purposes of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.
Third, I view the allegations respecting misrepresentations made both before and after the written contract was executed as being sufficient when considering the purposes of Rule 9(b). The allegations give sufficient notice of the basis of the allegations of fraud to enable the defendant to prepare a meaningful response. In view of the sufficiency of the breach of contract claim which arises out of the same set of circumstances, it can hardly be said that the fraud claim is a pretext to discovering a wrong or that the fraud claim is being used as a “strike suit.” Roberts v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co., Inc., 653 F.Supp. 406, 415-16 (D.Mass., 1986). Lastly, the fraud claim cannot be labelled as frivolous.
Fourth, in view of what I have indicated regarding the sufficiency as to time and place of misrepresentations made at on-site and off-site demonstrations and at on-site visits and in correspondence, I do not find a violation of Rule 9(b) in the allegations that the same misrepresentations were also made in unspecified telephone calls between agents of the parties during the specified time periods. Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., is to be harmonized with Rule 8(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., which provides for a “short and plain statement of the claim.” There would be no harmony between the two rules if a plaintiff, in order to comply with Rule 9(b), had to list every time and place at which a specific misrepresentation was repeated.
Lastly, I do not see a violation of Rule 9(b) in the failure of the plaintiff to identify the specific agent of the defendant who made each misrepresentation. Although other courts have construed Rule 9(b) as requiring an identification of the maker of the misrepresentation, none of the First Circuit cases indicate that such identification is a prerequisite to compliance with Rule 9(b); all that is required is a specification of time, place and content. To be sure, I can envisage some circumstances in which an identification might well be required. For example, if a complaint alleged only a single misrepresentation by an agent of a defendant and specified the time, place and content but not the identity of the agent, it could well be argued that the defendant-corporation would need further specification in order to make a meaningful response to the claim. But the circumstances of the instant case are different. There appears to have been an extended period of dealings between the parties culminating in a written contract which both sides acknowledge as having executed. I cannot see how a specification of the identity of the defendant’s agents who allegedly made the misrepresentations is necessary in order for the defendant to understand the basis of the fraud claim and to be able to respond to it.

I am happy to help you with your query. Based on the reference cases you provided, specifically 616 F.2d 603, 678 F.2d 376, and 474 U.S. 140, I can assist you in analyzing the legal issues related to the Federal Magistrates Act and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

In the reference case 616 F.2d 603, the court held that a party may choose not to file objections to a magistrate's report and recommendation, but if they do file objections, the objections must be served and filed within the specified time period. This is in line with the statutory language and purpose of the Federal Magistrates Act.

In the reference case 678 F.2d 376, the court emphasized the importance of specificity in pleading fraud and misrepresentation claims. The court held that allegations based on "information and belief" do not satisfy the particularity requirement unless the complaint sets forth the facts on which the belief is founded.

In the reference case 474 U.S. 140, the court reiterated the importance of specificity in pleading fraud and misrepresentation claims. The court held that Rule 9(b) requires specification of time, place, and content of an alleged false representation, and that allegations based on "information and belief" do not satisfy the particularity requirement.

Based on these reference cases, it is clear that the Federal Magistrates Act and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require specificity and particularity in pleading fraud and misrepresentation claims. The courts have emphasized the importance of providing adequate notice to defendants of the alleged fraudulent conduct and the need to specify the time, place, and content of the alleged misrepresentations.

In the context of the instant case, it appears that the Second Amended Complaint complies with the requirements of Rule 9(b) and the Federal Magistrates Act. The complaint provides sufficient specificity and particularity in pleading the alleged misrepresentations and provides adequate notice to the defendants of the alleged fraudulent conduct.

In conclusion, based on the reference cases and the analysis provided, it is clear that the Federal Magistrates Act and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require specificity and particularity in pleading fraud and misrepresentation claims. The courts have emphasized the importance of providing adequate notice to defendants of the alleged fraudulent conduct and the need to specify the time, place, and content of the alleged misrepresent

for the disposition, by a judge . . .” The Act further provides, (C) [T]he magistrate shall file his proposed findings and recommendations under subparagraph (B) with the court and a copy shall forthwith be mailed to all parties. Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. (Emphasis suppl.) Basically, the dispute between the parties centers upon the effect of the phrase “may serve and file written objections.” Defendants assert that a party may decide not to file, but that filing is obligatory if he is dissatisfied. Plaintiffs’ position is that the district court has a duty to review the magistrate’s recommendations in any event, and that the losing party need file objections only if he wishes a hearing. Although the court cited its Local Rule 7(c), this rule is of no assistance. Other than referring to the statute itself, it is limited to “appeal[s]” from orders under subsection (b)(1)(A). We turn, accordingly, to the statute. There are three possible areas of consideration: the statutory language, the statutory purpose, and the legislative history. First, plaintiffs point to the

This was an incorrect assumption. The Federal Magistrate’s Act, 28 U.S.C. § 631 et seq. reads in pertinent part: parties. Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. The judge may also receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate with instructions. (B) a judge may also designate a magistrate to conduct hearings, including evi-dentiary hearings, and to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition, by a judge of the court, of any motion excepted in subparagraph (A), of applications for posttrial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses and of prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement.

admit the proffered testimony had not impaired the fundamental fairness of the trial, and therefore was not an adequate ground for habeas corpus relief. The last page of the Magistrate’s report contained the prominent legend: “ANY OBJECTIONS to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of Courts within ten (10) days of receipt of this notice. Failure to file objections within the specified time waives the right to appeal the District Court’s order. See: United States v. Walters, 638 F. 2d 947 (6th Cir. 1981).” Despite this clear notice, petitioner failed to file objections at any time. She sought and received an extension of time to file objections through June 15, 1982, on the grounds that “this case entails many substantive issues and counsel needs more time to write his brief.” However, petitioner made no further submissions on the merits to the District Court. Notwithstanding petitioner’s failure to file objections, the District Judge sua sponte “review[ed] . . . the entire record de novo,” App. 59, and dismissed the petition on the merits.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT (# 29)
Feb. 27, 1989.
ROBERT B. COLLINGS, United States Magistrate.
Terry Howard, Byron Roseman and Frederick Wikander are three Massachusetts physicians who were trustees of Medical Associates, a Massachusetts business trust. Chelmsford Medical Associates, Inc., a professional corporation, is alleged to be the successor-in-interest of Medical Associates.
The instant case arises out of agreements reached whereby the defendant would sell and grant certain licenses respecting a computer system for use by the business trust. The Second Amended Complaint contains claims for intentional or negligent misrepresentation (Count I), breach of contract (Count II), breach of warranties (Count III), negligence/computer malpractice (Count IV) and unfair or deceptive acts and practices (Count V). Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.
I RECOMMEND that all but one of the grounds listed in the Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss The Amended Complaint (# 29) be DEFERRED for resolution at the PreTrial Conference when discovery has been completed. See Rule 12(d), Fed.R.Civ.P. The reason for this recommendation is that the defendant does not assert that all of the claims in the Second Amended Complaint (as opposed to the Amended Complaint) are subject to dismissal. Specifical ly, to the extent that Count II of the Second Amended Complaint contains a claim by plaintiffs Howard, Roseman and Wikander for breach of contract, defendant does not contend that Count II is subject to dismissal. Since the case will go forward on that claim regardless of whether the other claims are dismissed and since the scope of discovery would be approximately the same regardless of whether or not the other claims are dismissed at this time, it seems to me in the interests of judicial economy to defer the motion to dismiss the other claims until after the issues respecting those claims have been sharpened by the discovery process.
The one exception is the claim that the counts sounding in fraud and misrepresentation are not pleaded with the particularity required by Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. This type of issue should not be deferred.
This is not the first time I have reviewed plaintiffs’ pleadings to determine if the allegations of fraud have complied with Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. On February 12, 1988,1 issued a Memorandum (# 20) indicating that although the content of the misrepresentations was adequately pleaded, the pleadings were defective because of the failure to state the time and place of the alleged misrepresentations.
In the Amended Complaint (# 26) and in the Second Amended Complaint (# 62), plaintiffs have sought to rectify this deficiency. They claim they have done so; defendant disagrees.
Count I of the Second Amended Complaint alleging misrepresentation is divided into two parts. The first deals with misrepresentations allegedly made before the parties entered into a written contract; the second deals with misrepresentations made after the written contract was signed.
Paragraph 34 concerns misrepresentations made before the contract was signed and reads as follows:
34. To induce Chelmsford Medical Associates to enter into the Systems Purchase Agreement, Cycare falsely represented the features, performance and quality of the system and the nature and quality of Cycare’s support services, and falsely represented the benefits to Chelmsford Medical Associates of using the system. Specifically, and without limitation, Cycare made the representations as described in paragraph 11, above.
Paragraph 11 contains twelve subparts (a through 1) which list “representations” allegedly made. After each of the subparts, a “specification” of time and place is set forth in parentheses. The “specifications” are similar. Examples are:
a. (This representation was made during the one-site demonstration and in documentation.)”
c. “... (This representation was made in the on-site and off-site demonstrations, during the on-site visits and during telephone discussions between the parties.)”
g. “... (These representations were made during the on-site and off-site demonstrations, during the on-site visits and in the Written Proposal and in the documentation.)”
Paragraph 8 contains dates and places of a number of these events. The on-site demonstration occurred at the plaintiffs’ offices on May 23-24, 1985. The “Written Proposal” was made on or about June 24, 1985. The “off-site” demonstration occurred on June 26-27, 1985 at Memphis, Tennessee. It is further alleged that “additional on-site visits by Cycare to Chelmsford [occurred] during the period July-September, 1985.” Lastly, it is alleged that the telephone conversations occurred between May, 1985 and the date of the execution of the written contract, i.e., September 30, 1985.
The second group of alleged misrepresentations is alleged to have occurred after September 30,1985. Paragraphs 35 and 36 of the Second Amended Complaint read as follows:
35. To induce Chelmsford Medical Associates to continue to use a defective system, CyCare falsely represented that it could and would remedy the malfunctions and problems with the computer system. These representations were made beginning in approximately March, 1986 when the first computer run was made on the CyCare system, and continued to be made up to and including June, 1987. These representations were made by CyCare while present at Chelmsford Medical Associates’ site, including but not limited to meetings in March 1986, April 1986, July 1986, October 1986 and March 1987 and in telephone conversations throughout the period, including but not limited to the following correspondence:
a. letter dated August 6, 1986 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
b. letter dated August 21, 1986 from David Bennett to Alan Carr-Locke;
c. letter dated September 24, 1986 from David Bennett to Alan Carr-Locke;
d. letter dated October 13, 1986 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
e. letter dated October 25, 1986 from Lorraine Hess to Alan Carr-Locke;
f. letter dated March 30, 1987 from Lorraine Hess to Dick Farrar;

h. letter dated April 22, 1987 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
i. letter dated May 22, 1987 from Daniel A. Wolfe to Byron Roseman, M.D.
The resolution of whether plaintiffs have now complied with Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ. P., is governed by the five most recent First Circuit cases construing Rule 9(b), Fed.R. Civ.P., i.e. McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., 633 F.2d 226, 228 (1 Cir.,1980); Wayne v. Gulf Oil Corp., 739 F.2d 11 (1 Cir.,1984); Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., 754 F.2d 430 (1 Cir.,1985); Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441 (1 Cir.,1985) and New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, 829 F.2d 286 (1 Cir.,1987).
In McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., the Court wrote:
The clear weight of authority is that Rule 9 requires specification of time, place and content of an alleged false representation but not the circumstances or evidence from which fraudulent intent could be inferred, [citations omitted] This interpretation of Rule 9 comports with its language, harmonizes the rule with Rule 8, which requires that averments in pleadings be concise and direct, and at the same time fulfills a major purpose of Rule 9: to give adequate notice of the plaintiff’s claim of fraud or mistake, [citations omitted]
Id., 633 F.2d at 228-29.
In Wayne v. Gulf Oil Corp., the Court added “... that allegations based on ‘information and belief' do not satisfy the particularity requirement unless the complaint sets forth the facts on which the belief is founded ... and that the requirement that supporting facts be pleaded applies even when the fraud relates to matters within the knowledge of the opposing party.” Id., 739 F.2d at 13-14.
In Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., the Court noted that the “purpose of the rule [9(b) ] is to protect the defendant from unfair surprise and to discourage ‘strike suits.’ ” Id., 754 F.2d at 439. In addition, the Court wrote:

One of the main purposes of [Rule 9(b) ] is to apprise the defendant of fraudulent claims and of the acts which form the basis of the claim, [citations omitted] In other words, ‘[i]n cases in which fraud lies at the core of the action, the rule does not permit a complainant to file suit first, and subsequently to search for a cause of action.’ Lopez v. Bulova Watch Co., Inc., 582 F.Supp. 755, 766 (D.R.I.1984) (citing Deyhle v. Barclay Investments, Inc., No. 82-0662, slip op. at 4 (D.R.I. Oct. 13, 1983)) (emphasis added).
Id., 775 F.2d at 443.
Lastly, in New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, the Court considered the applicability of Rule 9(b) to predicate acts of mail and wire fraud which were pleaded in a RICO claim. The Court held that “Rule 9(b) requires specificity in the pleading of RICO mail and wire fraud [and] [t]his degree of specificity is no more nor less than we have required in fraud and securities fraud cases.” Id., 829 F.2d at 290 (citations omitted). In so holding, the Court wrote that:
Generally, there are three purposes behind Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirement: (1) to place the defendants on notice and enable them to prepare meaningful responses; (2) to preclude the use of a groundless fraud claim as a pretext to discovering a wrong or as a “strike suit”; and (3) to safeguard defendants from frivolous charges which might damage their reputations, [citations omitted]
Id., 829 F.2d at 289.
The Court specifically noted that in determining whether Rule 9(b) is satisfied, a Court must “keep in mind” these three major purposes of Rule 9(b).
Applying these principles to the case at bar, it becomes apparent that the Second Amended Complaint complies with the provisions of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. Therefore, I RECOMMEND that Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss The Amended Complaint (# 29) be deemed to seek dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint and that to the extent that the motion seeks dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint on the ground that it fails to plead fraud and misrepresentation with the requisite degree of particularity, the motion be DENIED.
First, all but two of the misrepresentations alleged in paragraph 11 (made before the written contract was executed) are alleged to have been made at either the “on-site demonstration” or the “off-site demonstration” or both. The dates and places of both the “on-site demonstration” and the “off-site demonstration” are stated with particularity in paragraph 8. The other two misrepresentations are alleged to have been made at “on-site visits.” Since “on-site” refers to the plaintiffs’ business premises, the place of the misrepresentations is pleaded with particularity. The time is specified in paragraph 8 as being within the three months period from July through September, 1985. In the circumstances, I view this as sufficient particularity.
Second, each of the alleged misrepresentations made after the written contract was signed are alleged to have been made in nine pieces of correspondence which are listed by date, sender, and recipient in paragraph 35 of the Second Amended Complaint. This is sufficient particularity as to time and place for the purposes of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.
Third, I view the allegations respecting misrepresentations made both before and after the written contract was executed as being sufficient when considering the purposes of Rule 9(b). The allegations give sufficient notice of the basis of the allegations of fraud to enable the defendant to prepare a meaningful response. In view of the sufficiency of the breach of contract claim which arises out of the same set of circumstances, it can hardly be said that the fraud claim is a pretext to discovering a wrong or that the fraud claim is being used as a “strike suit.” Roberts v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co., Inc., 653 F.Supp. 406, 415-16 (D.Mass., 1986). Lastly, the fraud claim cannot be labelled as frivolous.
Fourth, in view of what I have indicated regarding the sufficiency as to time and place of misrepresentations made at on-site and off-site demonstrations and at on-site visits and in correspondence, I do not find a violation of Rule 9(b) in the allegations that the same misrepresentations were also made in unspecified telephone calls between agents of the parties during the specified time periods. Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., is to be harmonized with Rule 8(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., which provides for a “short and plain statement of the claim.” There would be no harmony between the two rules if a plaintiff, in order to comply with Rule 9(b), had to list every time and place at which a specific misrepresentation was repeated.
Lastly, I do not see a violation of Rule 9(b) in the failure of the plaintiff to identify the specific agent of the defendant who made each misrepresentation. Although other courts have construed Rule 9(b) as requiring an identification of the maker of the misrepresentation, none of the First Circuit cases indicate that such identification is a prerequisite to compliance with Rule 9(b); all that is required is a specification of time, place and content. To be sure, I can envisage some circumstances in which an identification might well be required. For example, if a complaint alleged only a single misrepresentation by an agent of a defendant and specified the time, place and content but not the identity of the agent, it could well be argued that the defendant-corporation would need further specification in order to make a meaningful response to the claim. But the circumstances of the instant case are different. There appears to have been an extended period of dealings between the parties culminating in a written contract which both sides acknowledge as having executed. I cannot see how a specification of the identity of the defendant’s agents who allegedly made the misrepresentations is necessary in order for the defendant to understand the basis of the fraud claim and to be able to respond to it.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW (continued)

In Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55, the Supreme Court emphasized that property rights in the assets of a bankrupt's estate are determined by state law unless a federal interest dictates otherwise. In this case, we must determine the debtor's obligations under Puerto Rican law and assess the applicability of interest on the debt owed to Nelson Torres Ruiz.

Consistent with the principles outlined in 114 B.R. 326, the determination of whether the debtor has a legal or equitable interest in the obligation to return the $3,000 option money necessitates an analysis grounded in applicable nonbankruptcy state law. Article 1061 of the P.R. Civil Code, 31 Laws of P.R.Ann., Section 3025, establishes that where a debtor fails to perform an obligation, the creditor is entitled to interest as indemnification for damages and losses incurred.

Debtor's claim of impossibility of performance is addressed under Article 1138 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, but as established earlier, such a defense is unwarranted when the impossibility is not due to legal or physical barriers (31 Laws of P.R.Ann., Section 3193). Given the absence of such barriers, the return of the $3,000 is mandated.

Furthermore, in alignment with 117 B.R. 15, the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings does not alter the creditor’s right to claim interest at the legal rate. Should the contract fail to specify an interest rate, Article 1061 defaults to a legal interest rate of 6% per annum.

Thus, Mr. Bonilla is obliged to reimburse the full amount of $3,000 plus the applicable legal interest rate of 6% from the expiration of the option contract until the filing of the bankruptcy petition.

order against the debtor. The automatic stay prevented any further action by the Bank, including service of the restraining order. The debtor has remained in physical possession and has continued to collect all of its rents. The Bank promptly filed with the bankruptcy court an emergency motion for relief from stay and for authority to continue with its possession and to collect the rents. The law was clarified by the United States Supreme Court in 1979 in the case of Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d 136, 4 B.C.D. 1259. The court held that: ... Congress has generally left the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt’s estate to state law. Property interests are created and defined by state law. Unless some federal interest requires a different result, there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding. Looking to Massachusetts law, an assignment of rent gives the mortgagee a valid security interest which becomes effective upon a default and an overt act by the mortgagee to take actual or constructive possession. Bankruptcy does not change the assignee/mortgagee’s right to the rent so long as possession was obtained pre-fil-ing, or a request is made to the bankruptcy-court for relief.

previous_text: OPINION AND ORDER
SARA E. de JESUS, Bankruptcy Judge.
The matter pending before the Court is whether creditors Nelson and Elizabeth Torres are entitled to the payment of interest on Claim # 13, and the applicable interest rate.
Pursuant to Debtor’s request for a valuation of claim # 13, we held an evidentiary hearing. The parties have agreed to the following facts:
“a. That on July 22, 1980, Nelson Torres Ruiz and Adrián Bonilla Montalvo signed an Option Contract for the purchase of a plot of land marked number twenty (20).
b. The price of said plot of land was $7,250.00, of which at the signing of the Option Contract, Nelson Torres Ruiz paid Adrián Bonilla Montalvo the sum of $500.00 and later that same day paid him $2,500.00 for a total of $3,000.00.
c. The Option Contract enumerated a period of two years from the date of signing within which the debtor, Adrián Bonilla Montalvo, was to execute the purchase deed or reimburse Nelson Torres Ruiz the sum of $3,000.00. ,
d. That Mr. Nelson Torres Ruiz was single when he entered into an option agreement for certain lot of land on July 22, 1980.
e. That Mr. Nelson Torres Ruiz gave Mr. Adrián Bonilla $3,000.00 as option money-
f. That debtor according to clause # 6 of the option contract is obliged, and has accepted to do so, to return to this creditor the $3,000.00.
g. That debtor has recognized the debt of $3,000.00 owed to Mr. Nelson Torres and has scheduled the same as $900.00 priority and $2,100.00 as general unsecured claim.
h. Mrs. Elizabeth Hermida de Torres married Mr. Nelson Torres Ruiz after the option contract was signed.
i. Mrs. Elizabeth Hermida de Torres was not a party to the option contract signed on July 22, 1980 by debtor and Mr. Nelson Torres.
j. .That on January 12, 1984, Mrs. Elizabeth Hermida de Torres was deputy clerk of the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, Courtroom of Mayaguez.
k. That Banco Comercial de Mayaguez filed suit number 81-1138 against debtor and his ex-wife on the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, Courtroom of Mayaguez.
l. That on June 7, 1983 Attorney Jovino Martinez wrote a letter to debtor on behalf of Mr. Nelson Torres requesting the return of the option money given by him to debt- or.
m. The plot of land where Mr. Nelson Torres had his option was sold after the filing for relief and with the authority of this Court.”
Two Joint Exhibits were also admitted: the Option contract executed by the Debtor and Nelson Torres on July 22, 1980; and a letter dated June 7, 1983 from Attorney Jovino Martinez Ramirez to Attorney Adrián Bonilla Montalvo requesting the return of the money paid by Mr. Torres plus legal interest.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
In bankruptcy, issues as to the validity and legality of a claim are determined pursuant to applicable state law. Thus, we must decide the question at hand by applying the pertinent Articles of the Civil Code of P.R.
The option contract executed by Debtor and Nelson Torres Ruiz, called for the execution of the deed of sale within two years from July 22, 1980. However, the contractual terms also required Mr. Bonilla to return the total price for the option, if he could not obtain the permits required by the local government allowing him to segregate and sell the optioned plot, within this same two year period. The contract does not mention interest payments.
The Debtor raises the defense of impossibility of compliance with the obligation in order to release himself from the obligation and/or any liability. Mr. Bonilla claims a legal and physical impossibility based on events which occured almost six years after the Option contract had expired, and, in any event, these events concern his fiscal or monetary problems. Article 1138 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, 31 Laws of P.R.Ann., Section 3193, provides that, “In obligations to do, the debtor shall also be released when the prestation appears to be legally or physically impossible.” However, Debtor’s reliance on this Article of the Civil Code is unwarranted inasmuch as the legal and physical impossibility contemplated by law are not present in this contested matter.
Article 1061 of the P.R.Civil Code, 31 Laws of P.R.Ann., Section 3025, provides that when the obligation consists in the payment of a sum of money, and the person incurs in default, the creditor is entitled to be indemnified for damages and losses suffered, which will consist in the payment of interest. If the parties failed to agree upon the payment of interest and or the interest rate, then the interest to be paid will be the legal interest at the applicable rate. Furthermore, “Until another rate is fixed by the Government, interest at the rate of six percent per annum shall be considered as legal.”
Under these circumstances, Mr. Bonilla must reimburse the full amount of the option contract paid by Mr. Torres, plus interest at the legal rate of 6% per year, from the date the option contract expired to the date this petition was filed, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 502(b)(2).
. During the hearing, Nelson Torres Ruiz and his wife Elizabeth waived their claims for damages other than interest discussed herein.
. 11 U.S.C. Section 502(c)(2).
. It was also undisputed that Debtor was not able to secure the government permits needed to segregate and sell the plot to the Optionee, and the deed of sale was never executed.
. The Court takes judicial notice that the petition for bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Code was entered on February 19, 1987; and that Nelson and Elizabeth Torres, filed proof of claim no. 13 in the amount of $25,-000.00. Attached thereto are the copies of the following documents: the option contract entered into by the debtor Adrián Bonilla Montal-vo and Nelson Torres Ruiz on July 22, 1980; the complaint filed by Mr. Torres Ruiz against the debtor before the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Part, Civil No. CS-88-896, for collection of money and damages; and a copy of a sworn statement of Nelson Torres Ruiz dated June 22, 1988.
.During the hearing the parties testified this suit was stayed by the filing of this petition.

Expert analysis of the legal cases provided reveals that the rights of creditors Nelson and Elizabeth Torres to the payment of interest on Claim # 13 should be determined according to applicable state law. In this case, the Civil Code of Puerto Rico is relevant.

As stated in Article 1138 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, "In obligations to do, the debtor shall also be released when the prestation appears to be legally or physically impossible." However, as mentioned in Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48 (1979), the legal and physical impossibility contemplated by law are not present in this contested matter.

Furthermore, Article 1061 of the P.R.Civil Code provides that when the obligation consists in the payment of a sum of money, and the person incurs in default, the creditor is entitled to be indemnified for damages and losses suffered, which will consist in the payment of interest. In the absence of an agreed-upon interest rate, the legal interest rate at 6% per annum shall be applied, as stated in 11 U.S.C. Section 502(b)(2).

In reference to Bankruptcy Judge James F. Queenan, Jr.'s opinion in In re Prichard Plaza Associates Limited Partnership, 84 B.R. 289 (Bkrtcy.D.Mass.1988), the Court finds that Mr. Bonilla must reimburse the full amount of the option contract paid by Mr. Torres, plus interest at the legal rate of 6% per year, from the date the option contract expired to the date this petition was filed.

Also, considering the reference case 114 B.R. 326, U.S.C. § 363(b)(1), "Property of the estate" includes "all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case." However, in this case, the option contract was signed before the bankruptcy petition was filed, and the plot of land was sold after the filing with the authority of the Court.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of the legal cases provided, the Court concludes that the creditors Nelson and Elizabeth Torres are entitled to the payment of interest on Claim # 13, and the applicable interest rate is 6% per annum, as stated in 11 U.S.C. Section 502(b)(2).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
In bankruptcy, issues as to the validity and legality of a claim are determined pursuant to applicable state law. Thus, we must decide the question at hand by applying the pertinent Articles of the Civil Code of P.R.
The option contract executed by Debtor and Nelson Torres Ruiz, called for the execution of the deed of sale within two years from July 22, 1980. However, the contractual terms also required Mr. Bonilla to return the total price for the option, if he could not obtain the permits required by the local government allowing him to segregate and sell the optioned plot, within this same two year period. The contract does not mention interest payments.
The Debtor raises the defense of impossibility of compliance with the obligation in order to release himself from the obligation and/or any liability. Mr. Bonilla claims a legal and physical impossibility based on events which occured almost six years after the Option contract had expired, and, in any event, these events concern his fiscal or monetary problems. Article 1138 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, 31 Laws of P.R.Ann., Section 3193, provides that, “In obligations to do, the debtor shall also be released when the prestation appears to be legally or physically impossible.” However, Debtor’s reliance on this Article of the Civil Code is unwarranted inasmuch as the legal and physical impossibility contemplated by law are not present in this contested matter.
Article 1061 of the P.R.Civil Code, 31 Laws of P.R.Ann., Section 3025, provides that when the obligation consists in the payment of a sum of money, and the person incurs in default, the creditor is entitled to be indemnified for damages and losses suffered, which will consist in the payment of interest. If the parties failed to agree upon the payment of interest and or the interest rate, then the interest to be paid will be the legal interest at the applicable rate. Furthermore, “Until another rate is fixed by the Government, interest at the rate of six percent per annum shall be considered as legal.”
Under these circumstances, Mr. Bonilla must reimburse the full amount of the option contract paid by Mr. Torres, plus interest at the legal rate of 6% per year, from the date the option contract expired to the date this petition was filed, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 502(b)(2).
. During the hearing, Nelson Torres Ruiz and his wife Elizabeth waived their claims for damages other than interest discussed herein.
. 11 U.S.C. Section 502(c)(2).
. It was also undisputed that Debtor was not able to secure the government permits needed to segregate and sell the plot to the Optionee, and the deed of sale was never executed.
. The Court takes judicial notice that the petition for bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Code was entered on February 19, 1987; and that Nelson and Elizabeth Torres, filed proof of claim no. 13 in the amount of $25,-000.00. Attached thereto are the copies of the following documents: the option contract entered into by the debtor Adrián Bonilla Montal-vo and Nelson Torres Ruiz on July 22, 1980; the complaint filed by Mr. Torres Ruiz against the debtor before the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Part, Civil No. CS-88-896, for collection of money and damages; and a copy of a sworn statement of Nelson Torres Ruiz dated June 22, 1988.
.During the hearing the parties testified this suit was stayed by the filing of this petition.

In the context of the unseaworthiness doctrine, it is crucial to examine the provisions of both the bareboat charter and the time charter agreements. As previously established, the bareboat charter transferred full control and possession to Chaplin, making Chaplin the owner pro hoc vice and therefore responsible for the vessel’s seaworthiness at the time of the incident. Following the principles laid out in Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, and Morales v. City of Galveston, 370 U.S. 165, a ship’s gear, appurtenances, and manner of stowage must be reasonably fit for their intended purpose.

In addressing Plaintiff's allegations, it must be noted that the condition leading to the Plaintiff's injury must be attributable to the vessel's unseaworthy state rather than an isolated act of negligence by fellow crew members. As highlighted in 400 U.S. 494, an individual act of negligence does not render a vessel unseaworthy. Therefore, any claim of unseaworthiness must relate to inherent vessel deficiencies existing at the time of the charter’s inception or subsequently arising due to the charterer’s conduct.

With regards to the incineration barrel, the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to show that the vessel’s condition per 373 U.S. 206 was inherently unseaworthy at the time of the accident. The burn barrel itself does not appear to constitute an unseaworthy condition under the standards applied in earlier cases.

Based on the evidence and the precedents discussed, the movement for summary judgment by Chaplin on the grounds of unseaworthiness is not substantiated. Consequently, the motion for summary judgment by Mon River on grounds of the vessel's alleged unseaworthiness is GRANTED.

IV. 
In sum, the bareboat charter agreement effectively transferred ownership responsibilities to Chaplin, and no substantial evidence indicates unseaworthiness from Mon River’s side that would breach the express warranty concerning seaworthiness at delivery. Therefore, the court GRANTS the summary judgment for Mon River and DENIES Plaintiff's claim against Chaplin on the grounds presented.

It is so ordered.

Waterman Steamship Corp., 1963, 373 U.S. 206, 83 S.Ct. 1185, 10 L.Ed.2d 297, 1963 A.M.C. 1649, the Supreme Court concluded that ‘things about a ship, whether the hull, the decks, the machinery, the tools furnished, the stowage, or the cargo containers, must be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are to be used.’ Id. at 213, 83 S.Ct. at 1190, 10 L.Ed.2d at 303. More recently, in Usner v. Luckenbach, 1971, 400 U.S. 494, 91 S.Ct. 514, 27 L.Ed.2d 562, 1971 A.M.C. 277, the Supreme Court said that: ‘A vessel’s condition of unseaworthiness might arise from any number of circumstances. Her gear might be defective, her appurtenances might be in disrepair, her crew unfit. The number of men assigned to perform a shipboard task might be insufficient. The method of loading her cargo, or the manner of its stowage, might be improper.

which is in essence that things about a ship, whether the hull, the decks, the machinery, the tools furnished, the stowage, or the cargo containers, must be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are to be used. See Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U. S. 539, 550; Morales v. City of Galveston, 370 U. S. 165, 169, 172 (dissenting opinion). A ship that leaks is unseaworthy; so is a cargo container that leaks. When the shipowner accepts cargo in a faulty container or allows the container to become faulty, he assumes the responsibility for injury that this may cause to seamen or their substitutes on or about the ship. Beans belong inside their containers, and anyone should know, as the trial court found, that serious injury may result if they get out of their containers and get underfoot. These bean bags were unfit and thus unseaworthy. The second question is one of first impression in this Court, although other federal courts have already recognized that the case law compels this conclusion. Strika v. Netherlands Ministry of Traffic, 185 F. 2d 555 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Robillard v. A. L. Burbank & Co., 186 F. Supp. 193 (S. D. N. Y.); see Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Cordray, 258 F. 2d 214, 218 (C. A. 9th Cir.). In Strika, while the longshoreman was working on the dock, use of an improper wire cable caused a hatch cover to fall on him. Building on such cases as O’Donnell v.

reference_case_2: 400 U.S. 494

our cases have held that the scope of unseaworthiness is by no means so limited. A vessel’s condition of unseaworthiness might arise from any number of circumstances. Her gear might be defective, her appurtenances in disrepair, her crew unfit. The number of men assigned to perform a shipboard task might be insufficient. The method of loading her cargo, or the manner of its stowage, might be improper. For any of these reasons, or others, a vessel might not be reasonably fit for her intended service. What caused the petitioner’s injuries in the present case, however, was not the condition of the ship, her appurtenances, her cargo, or her crew, but the isolated, personal negligent act of the petitioner’s fellow longshoreman. To hold that this individual act of negligence rendered the ship unseaworthy would be' to subvert the fundamental distinction between unseaworthiness and negligence that we have so painstakingly and repeatedly emphasized in our decisions. In Trawler Racer, supra, there existed a condition of unseaworthiness,, and we held it was error to require a finding of negligent conduct in order to hold the shipowner liable. The case before us-presents the other side of the same coin. For it would be equally erroneous here, where no condition of unseaworthiness existed, to hold the shipowner liable for a third party’s single and wholly unforeseeable act of negligence. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. It is so ordered.' 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (b) provides as follows: Compare Candiano v.

previous_text: MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
HADEN, Chief Judge.
Pending is the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants Chaplin Marine Transport, Inc. (“Chaplin”) and Mon River Towing, Inc. (“Mon River”). Plaintiff has responded and Defendants have replied. This issue is ripe for adjudication.
Plaintiff initiated this action on May 28, 1993. He filed an amended complaint on December 7,1994. Plaintiff contends he was injured while working on the MTV Lillian G, a tow boat, on November 25,1992. The Lillian G is owned by Mon River, but was being operated pursuant to a bareboat, or demise charter by Chaplin. In turn, Chaplin was operating the boat pursuant to a purported time charter between it and Mon River. Plaintiff contends he was following the common practice of his employer, Chaplin, when he was seriously burned as he attempted to incinerate garbage in a barrel located on the deck of the vessel. He asserts Mon River was aware of the presence and use of the barrel to burn garbage at the time of the incident. Plaintiff asserts causes of action based upon this Court’s admiralty jurisdiction and the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.App. § 688.
I.
Defendants contend they are entitled to summary judgment. The standard used to determine whether a motion for summary judgment should be granted or denied is stated by our Court of Appeals as follows:
“A moving party is entitled to summary judgment ‘if the pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’ Fed R.Civ.Pro. 56(c). See Charbonnages de France v. Smith, 597 F.2d 406 (4th Cir.1979).
“A genuine issue of material fact exists ‘if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmov-ing party.’ Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In considering a motion for summary judgement, the court is required to view the facts and draw reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id. at 255, 106 S.Ct. at 2513-14. The plaintiff is entitled to have the credibility of all his evidence presumed. Miller v. Leathers, 913 F.2d 1085, 1087 (4th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1109, 111 S.Ct. 1018, 112 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1991). The party seeking summary judgment has the initial burden to show absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553-54, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The opposing party must demonstrate that a triable issue of fact exists; he may not rest upon mere allegations or denials. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510. A mere scintilla of evidence supporting the ease is insufficient. Id.” Shaw v. Stroud, 13 F.3d 791, 798 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 67, 130 L.Ed.2d 24, and cert. denied, — U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 68, 130 L.Ed.2d 24 (1994).
Accord, McCoy v. United Postal Service, 890 F.Supp. 529, 531 n. 3 (S.D.W.Va.1995) (Haden, C.J.); Browning v. Snead, 886 F.Supp. 547, 549-50 (S.D.W.Va.1995) (Haden, C.J.).
II.
Mon River asserts it is not liable for any negligence occurring on or unseaworthiness of the Lillian G. It relies on the bareboat charter agreement between it and Chaplin. It claims the bareboat charter turns exclusive control, operation and navigation of the vessel over to Chaplin, thus relieving it of responsibility for Plaintiffs injuries. For the reasons that follow the Court agrees.
The owner of a vessel is normally liable for injuries caused by the vessel’s un seaworthiness. McAleer v. Smith, 57 F.3d 109, 111-12 (1st Cir.1995), citing, Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 90, 66 S.Ct. 872, 875, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946) (citing, The Osceola, 189 U.S. 158, 23 S.Ct. 483, 47 L.Ed. 760 (1903)); Moore v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 912 F.2d 789, 792 (5th Cir.1990) (“The vessel owner remains responsible for the seaworthiness of the vessel[.]”).
Nonetheless, an owner may turn the exclusive possession, control and navigation over to another party through a bare-boat, or demise charter. A bareboat charter is
“created when ‘the owner of the vessel .-.. completely and exclusively relinquishes] possession, command, and navigation thereof to the demisee. [They are] therefore tantamount to, though just short of, an outright transfer of ownership. However, anything short of such a complete transfer is a time or voyage charter party or not a charter party at all.’ ” McAleer v. Smith, supra, 57 F.3d at 113, citing, Guzman v. Pichirilo, 369 U.S. 698, 699-700, 82 S.Ct. 1095, 1096, 8 L.Ed.2d 205 (1962) (internal quotation and citation omitted).
See Wheatley v. Gladden, 660 F.2d 1024, 1026 (4th Cir.1981) (“Under a bareboat charter the charterer assumes all the obligations of ownership, including those of the employer and crew. United States v. W.M. Webb, Inc., [397 U.S. 179, 90 S.Ct. 850, 25 L.Ed.2d 207 (1970) ]. The test for establishing a bareboat charter is one of control — has the owner completely relinquished possession and command of the boat.”); Carolina Seafoods, Inc. v. United States, 581 F.2d 1098, 1100 (4th Cir.1978). The charterer under a bareboat or demise charter thus stands in the shoes of the owner and becomes the owner pro hoc vice. Because the bareboat charterer stands in the shoes of the owner, the bareboat charterer assumes the duties and responsibilities appurtenant to ownership, and the owner is relieved of the same. As stated recently in Dow Chemical Co. v. Texaco Refining and Marketing, Inc., 887 F.Supp. 853, 863, (E.D.Va.1995):
“Under a bareboat or demise charter, full possession and control of the chartered vessel is turned over to the charterer. Reed v. S.S. Yaka, 373 U.S. 410, 412, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 1351, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963) (‘It has long been recognized in the law of admiralty that for many, if not most purposes the bareboat charterer is to be treated as the owner, generally called the owner pro hoc vice.’); Alex L. Parks & Edward V. Cattel, Jr., The Law of Tug, Tow & Pilotage 875 (3d ed.1994). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has stated:
This rule recognizes that when the owner of the vessel enters into a demise charter, he surrenders all possession and control of the vessel to the charterer. Since he no longer has the right to control the use of the vessel, he is no longer charged with the duties and liabilities of its ownership. Conversely, the demise charterer ‘becomes subject to the duties and responsibilities of ownership.’
Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Law, 479 F.2d 61, 63 (4th Cir.1973) (quoting Leary v. United States, 81 U.S. (14 Wall) 607, 610, 20 L.Ed. 756 (1872)). As a bareboat charterer, the charterer is held to be a bailee of the vessel. Richmond Sand & Gravel Corp. v. Tidewater Constr. Corp., 170 F.2d 392, 393 (4th Cir.1948); 2b Benedict on Admiralty § 51, at 3-3 (1995).”
See Forrester v. Ocean Marine Indem. Co., 11 F.3d 1213, 1215 (5th Cir.1993) (“In a demise charter, the vessel owner transfers full possession and control to the charterer, who in turn furnishes the crew and maintenance for the vessel (thus the term ‘bare-boat’).”). And as stated in Wolsiffer v. Atlantis Submarines, Inc., 848 F.Supp. 1489, 1494 (D.Haw.1994):
“In order for the agreement to be considered a demise charter, complete transfer of possession, command, and navigation of the vessel from the owner to the charterer is necessary. Guzman v. Pichirilo, 369 U.S. 698, 700, 82 S.Ct. 1095, 1096-97, 8 L.Ed.2d 205 (1962); Gaspard v. Diamond M. Drilling Co., 593 F.2d 605, 606 (5th Cir.1979). ‘Anything short of ... a complete transfer is a time or voyage charter party or not a charter party at all.’ Guzman, 369 U.S. at 700, 82 S.Ct. at 1096. Courts are reluctant to find a demise char ter when the dealings between the parties are consistent with any lesser relationship.”
The owner of a vessel impliedly warrants its seaworthiness to the point of delivery to the bareboat charterer. Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Law, 479 F.2d 61 (4th Cir.1973); Dow Chemical Co. v. Texaco Refining and Marketing, Inc., 887 F.Supp. at 864, citing, Dempsey v. Downing, 11 F.2d 15, 17 (4th Cir.1926); In the Matter of D & H Corp., 1994 WL 574143, *1 (E.D.Va.1993); Cos v. French-Polish Shipping Co., 1986 WL 13361, *1 (D.Md.1986); Interocean Shipping Co. v. M/V Lygaria, 512 F.Supp. 960 (D.Md.1981). If the vessel was unseaworthy when delivered, the owner is liable for injuries caused by such unseaworthiness notwithstanding the existence of the bareboat charter. If the vessel is seaworthy upon delivery, the bareboat charterer then assumes the responsibilities of the owner for liability for injuries thereafter caused by the unseaworthiness of the vessel. McAleer v. Smith, supra, 57 F.3d at 112 (“In general, if there is an owner pro hac vice, the title owner will be absolved of personal liability (except for defective conditions that existed before the owner pro hac vice took control of the vessel).”); Forrester v. Ocean Marine Indem. Co., 11 F.3d at 1215 (“The demise charterer is ... responsible in personam for the negligence of the crew and the unseaworthiness of the vessel.”); Wolsiffer v. Atlantis Submarines, Inc., 848 F.Supp. at 1494 (“The remedy of unseaworthiness for an injured seaman applies in rem against the vessel and in personam against either the title owner of the vessel ..., or the owner pro hac vice under a demise charter.” (citation omitted).).
Plaintiff acknowledges the existence of the bareboat charter agreement and does not dispute the bareboat agreement has the effect of giving Chaplin the status of owner pro hac vice. Plaintiff argues Mon River is liable for the alleged unseaworthiness of the vessel, however, by virtue of the “charter party” agreement executed between Chaplin and Mon River the same day the bareboat charter agreement was executed. Plaintiff argues that pursuant to the charter party agreement, Mon River controlled Chaplin and the vessel, and is thus liable for its alleged unseaworthiness. Defendants, on the other hand, contend the agreement was a “time charter” agreement that left control and possession of the vessel solely in the hands of Chaplin, the pro hac vice owner under the bareboat agreement.
The second agreement entered into by the parties is entitled “Charter Party.” In the first paragraph of the agreement, the contract purports to be a “Time Charter.” Plaintiff acknowledges the time charter did not place any responsibility upon Mon River to furnish the crew or man the vessel. Instead, he relies only on paragraph six of the agreement, which states:
“6. REPORTS: Chaplin shall require that the master of the towboat report daily by radio the position of the tow and any other information that it is requested by [Mon River] regarding the status of the barges that it has or has had in tow. Chaplin shall require that the master of the towboat report weekly by radio the engine hours of the two main engines and the two generator engines on the boat. Chaplin shall furnish to Mon River copies of all purchases of fuel oil, lubricating oil and hydraulic oil which are purchased for consumption aboard the towboat M/V Lillian G. Mon River Towing will pay said vendors of such oils directly.”
Plaintiff suggests the foregoing, combined with his contention that the vessel frequently refueled and underwent engine maintenance at a location operated by Mon River, is enough to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the control of the vessel for liability purposes. The Court disagrees.
In contrast to a bareboat charter, a time charter does not vest operational control in the time charterer. Instead, the time charterer directs the destinations of the vessel without assuming any responsibility for the actual operation of the ship. Therefore, the time charterer is not held hable for the negligence of the crew or the unseaworthiness of the vessel. As stated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit:
“A time charter only entitles the charterer to the use of the vessel for a specified time. The vessel owner retains primary possession and control. Although a time charterer does direct the destinations of the vessel, he does not control the details of vessel operation required to reach those destinations. As a non-demise charterer, the time charterer is thus not liable for claims of negligence of the crew or for the unseaworthiness of the vessel. But the time charterer may be liable in that capacity for his own negligence.” (footnotes omitted and emphasis added). Forrester v. Ocean Marine Indem. Co., 11 F.3d at 1215.
In Moore v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 912 F.2d at 791-92, the Court distinguished the responsibilities of time charterers from those of owners as follows:
“Under the traditional time-charter agreement, the time charterer directs the vessel’s commercial activities. It may designate the cargo to be carried and determine the vessel’s routes and destinations. * * * The time charterer’s duties are different from the vessel owner’s duties. The vessel owner remains responsible for the seaworthiness of the vessel, e.g., Nichimen Co. v. M.V. Farland, 462 F.2d 319, 331 (2nd Cir.1972), dangerous conditions on board, e.g., Migut v. Hyman-Michaels Co., 571 F.2d 352, 356 (6th Cir.1978), navigational errors by the pilot and negligence by the crew, e.g., Delta Transload, Inc. v. MV Navios Commander, 818 F.2d 445, 451 (5th Cir.1987), and a reasonably safe means of access for those boarding or leaving the vessel, see, e.g., Tittle v. Aldacosta, 544 F.2d 752, 755 (5th Cir.1977) [.]”
See Wolsiffer v. Atlantis Submarines, Inc., 848 F.Supp. at 1494; Roby v. Hyundai Merchant Marine, 700 F.Supp. 316, 320-21 (E.D.La.1988); Vlachos v. M/V Proso, 637 F.Supp. 1354, 1364 n. 14 (D.Md.1986).
As noted above, the Plaintiff acknowledges the delegation of responsibilities pursuant to the bareboat charter. Under said agreement, Mon River transferred possession, control and command of the Lillian G to Chaplin. Chaplin thus became the pro hoc vice owner of the vessel, legally responsible for the unseaworthiness of the vessel after the date of transfer. Chaplin, in turn, executed a purported time charter agreement with Mon River. Although Plaintiff argues the time charter had the effect of a demise charter transferring control over the vessel back to Mon River, the Court disagrees.
In essence, it appears Plaintiff is arguing Chaplin, after becoming the bareboat charterer and pro hac vice owner, executed a bareboat charter back to Mon River, making Mon River both paper owner and pro hac vice owner of the vessel. The Court notes the following: first, Plaintiff does not dispute Chaplin was a bareboat charterer under the first agreement, and therefore pro hac vice owner of the vessel; second, in regard to the second agreement between Chaplin and Mon River a time charter, rather than a bareboat charter, is presumed to exist as a matter of law and such presumption may be overcome only by specific facts showing a demise charter existed, Wolsijfer, supra, 848 F.Supp. at 1494, citing Gaspard v. Diamond M. Drilling Co., 593 F.2d 605, 607 (5th Cir.1979); third, the charter is an unrebutted time charter.
Plaintiff has been unable to present specific facts showing a demise charter was executed between Chaplin and Mon River after Mon River demised the vessel to Chaplin. The Court thus concludes the time charter is precisely what it purports to be. Therefore, because Chaplin, the pro hac vice owner of the boat, was responsible for the seaworthiness of the vessel on the date of the Plaintiff’s injury, the Court GRANTS Mon River’s motion for summary judgment on the unseaworthiness claim against it.
III.
Chaplin contends it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff failed to produce evidence the vessel was unseaworthy or that Chaplin was negligent. Plaintiff has attached several portions of depositions he asserts create a question of material fact regarding the seaworthiness of the Lillian G at the time of the incident and of Chaplin’s negligence.
Claims of negligence under the Jones Act or of unseaworthiness subject the plaintiff to a light burden of proof. As stated by the Court of Appeals in Estate of Larkins v. Farrell Lines, Inc., 806 F.2d 510, 512 (4th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1037, 107 S.Ct. 1973, 95 L.Ed.2d 814 (1987):
“Under the Jones Act, the standard of recovery has not been a strict one, and seamen have been afforded the ‘judicially developed doctrine of liability granted to railroad workers by the FELA,’ Kernan v. American Dredging Co., 355 U.S. 426, 439, 78 S.Ct. 394, 401, 2 L.Ed.2d 382 (1958), including its light burden of proof on negligence and causation. While the standard of causation for unseaworthiness is ‘more demanding,’ Chisholm v. Sabine Towing and Transportation Co., 679 F.2d 60, 62 (5th Cir.1982), the plaintiff’s burden in either case has been characterized as light. Vallot v. Central Gulf Lines, 641 F.2d 347, 350 (5th Cir.1981). The jury’s role, moreover, has been an important one in such cases, and doubts have been resolved in favor of submission.”
A.
A comprehensive but concise overview of an owner’s responsibility for a vessel’s seaworthiness was provided in Drachenberg v. Canal Barge Co., Inc., 571 F.2d 912, 918 (5th Cir.1978):

**Generation:**


The court's decision to grant summary judgment to Mon River Towing, Inc. is correct. As stated in 373 U.S. 206, a vessel's condition of unseaworthiness might arise from any number of circumstances, including defects in the vessel's gear, appurtenances, or crew. However, in this case, the evidence presented does not show that the vessel was unseaworthy at the time of the incident.

The plaintiff argues that the vessel was not properly maintained and that the crew was negligent, but these claims are not supported by the evidence. The court has already granted summary judgment to Mon River on the grounds that it transferred possession, control, and command of the vessel to Chaplin Marine Transport, Inc. under a bareboat charter agreement.

As stated in 400 U.S. 494, a bareboat charter agreement transfers all of the rights and responsibilities of ownership to the charterer. In this case, Chaplin Marine Transport, Inc. was the bareboat charterer and pro hac vice owner of the vessel, and it was responsible for the vessel's seaworthiness at the time of the incident.

The plaintiff has failed to present evidence that the vessel was unseaworthy or that Chaplin Marine Transport, Inc. was negligent. Therefore, the court's decision to grant summary judgment to Mon River Towing, Inc. is correct.

which is in essence that things about a ship, whether the hull, the decks, the machinery, the tools furnished, the stowage, or the cargo containers, must be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are to be used. See Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U. S. 539, 550; Morales v. City of Galveston, 370 U. S. 165, 169, 172 (dissenting opinion). A ship that leaks is unseaworthy; so is a cargo container that leaks. When the shipowner accepts cargo in a faulty container or allows the container to become faulty, he assumes the responsibility for injury that this may cause to seamen or their substitutes on or about the ship. Beans belong inside their containers, and anyone should know, as the trial court found, that serious injury may result if they get out of their containers and get underfoot. These bean bags were unfit and thus unseaworthy. The second question is one of first impression in this Court, although other federal courts have already recognized that the case law compels this conclusion. Strika v. Netherlands Ministry of Traffic, 185 F. 2d 555 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Robillard v. A. L. Burbank & Co., 186 F. Supp. 193 (S. D. N. Y.); see Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Cordray, 258 F. 2d 214, 218 (C. A. 9th Cir.). In Strika, while the longshoreman was working on the dock, use of an improper wire cable caused a hatch cover to fall on him. Building on such cases as O’Donnell v.

reference_case_2: 400 U.S. 494

our cases have held that the scope of unseaworthiness is by no means so limited. A vessel’s condition of unseaworthiness might arise from any number of circumstances. Her gear might be defective, her appurtenances in disrepair, her crew unfit. The number of men assigned to perform a shipboard task might be insufficient. The method of loading her cargo, or the manner of its stowage, might be improper. For any of these reasons, or others, a vessel might not be reasonably fit for her intended service. What caused the petitioner’s injuries in the present case, however, was not the condition of the ship, her appurtenances, her cargo, or her crew, but the isolated, personal negligent act of the petitioner’s fellow longshoreman. To hold that this individual act of negligence rendered the ship unseaworthy would be' to subvert the fundamental distinction between unseaworthiness and negligence that we have so painstakingly and repeatedly emphasized in our decisions. In Trawler Racer, supra, there existed a condition of unseaworthiness,, and we held it was error to require a finding of negligent conduct in order to hold the shipowner liable. The case before us-presents the other side of the same coin. For it would be equally erroneous here, where no condition of unseaworthiness existed, to hold the shipowner liable for a third party’s single and wholly unforeseeable act of negligence. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. It is so ordered.' 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (b) provides as follows: Compare Candiano v.

previous_text: MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
HADEN, Chief Judge.
Pending is the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants Chaplin Marine Transport, Inc. (“Chaplin”) and Mon River Towing, Inc. (“Mon River”). Plaintiff has responded and Defendants have replied. This issue is ripe for adjudication.
Plaintiff initiated this action on May 28, 1993. He filed an amended complaint on December 7,1994. Plaintiff contends he was injured while working on the MTV Lillian G, a tow boat, on November 25,1992. The Lillian G is owned by Mon River, but was being operated pursuant to a bareboat, or demise charter by Chaplin. In turn, Chaplin was operating the boat pursuant to a purported time charter between it and Mon River. Plaintiff contends he was following the common practice of his employer, Chaplin, when he was seriously burned as he attempted to incinerate garbage in a barrel located on the deck of the vessel. He asserts Mon River was aware of the presence and use of the barrel to burn garbage at the time of the incident. Plaintiff asserts causes of action based upon this Court’s admiralty jurisdiction and the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.App. § 688.
I.
Defendants contend they are entitled to summary judgment. The standard used to determine whether a motion for summary judgment should be granted or denied is stated by our Court of Appeals as follows:
“A moving party is entitled to summary judgment ‘if the pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’ Fed R.Civ.Pro. 56(c). See Charbonnages de France v. Smith, 597 F.2d 406 (4th Cir.1979).
“A genuine issue of material fact exists ‘if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmov-ing party.’ Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In considering a motion for summary judgement, the court is required to view the facts and draw reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id. at 255, 106 S.Ct. at 2513-14. The plaintiff is entitled to have the credibility of all his evidence presumed. Miller v. Leathers, 913 F.2d 1085, 1087 (4th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1109, 111 S.Ct. 1018, 112 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1991). The party seeking summary judgment has the initial burden to show absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553-54, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The opposing party must demonstrate that a triable issue of fact exists; he may not rest upon mere allegations or denials. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510. A mere scintilla of evidence supporting the ease is insufficient. Id.” Shaw v. Stroud, 13 F.3d 791, 798 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 67, 130 L.Ed.2d 24, and cert. denied, — U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 68, 130 L.Ed.2d 24 (1994).
Accord, McCoy v. United Postal Service, 890 F.Supp. 529, 531 n. 3 (S.D.W.Va.1995) (Haden, C.J.); Browning v. Snead, 886 F.Supp. 547, 549-50 (S.D.W.Va.1995) (Haden, C.J.).
II.
Mon River asserts it is not liable for any negligence occurring on or unseaworthiness of the Lillian G. It relies on the bareboat charter agreement between it and Chaplin. It claims the bareboat charter turns exclusive control, operation and navigation of the vessel over to Chaplin, thus relieving it of responsibility for Plaintiffs injuries. For the reasons that follow the Court agrees.
The owner of a vessel is normally liable for injuries caused by the vessel’s un seaworthiness. McAleer v. Smith, 57 F.3d 109, 111-12 (1st Cir.1995), citing, Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 90, 66 S.Ct. 872, 875, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946) (citing, The Osceola, 189 U.S. 158, 23 S.Ct. 483, 47 L.Ed. 760 (1903)); Moore v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 912 F.2d 789, 792 (5th Cir.1990) (“The vessel owner remains responsible for the seaworthiness of the vessel[.]”).
Nonetheless, an owner may turn the exclusive possession, control and navigation over to another party through a bare-boat, or demise charter. A bareboat charter is
“created when ‘the owner of the vessel .-.. completely and exclusively relinquishes] possession, command, and navigation thereof to the demisee. [They are] therefore tantamount to, though just short of, an outright transfer of ownership. However, anything short of such a complete transfer is a time or voyage charter party or not a charter party at all.’ ” McAleer v. Smith, supra, 57 F.3d at 113, citing, Guzman v. Pichirilo, 369 U.S. 698, 699-700, 82 S.Ct. 1095, 1096, 8 L.Ed.2d 205 (1962) (internal quotation and citation omitted).
See Wheatley v. Gladden, 660 F.2d 1024, 1026 (4th Cir.1981) (“Under a bareboat charter the charterer assumes all the obligations of ownership, including those of the employer and crew. United States v. W.M. Webb, Inc., [397 U.S. 179, 90 S.Ct. 850, 25 L.Ed.2d 207 (1970) ]. The test for establishing a bareboat charter is one of control — has the owner completely relinquished possession and command of the boat.”); Carolina Seafoods, Inc. v. United States, 581 F.2d 1098, 1100 (4th Cir.1978). The charterer under a bareboat or demise charter thus stands in the shoes of the owner and becomes the owner pro hoc vice. Because the bareboat charterer stands in the shoes of the owner, the bareboat charterer assumes the duties and responsibilities appurtenant to ownership, and the owner is relieved of the same. As stated recently in Dow Chemical Co. v. Texaco Refining and Marketing, Inc., 887 F.Supp. 853, 863, (E.D.Va.1995):
“Under a bareboat or demise charter, full possession and control of the chartered vessel is turned over to the charterer. Reed v. S.S. Yaka, 373 U.S. 410, 412, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 1351, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963) (‘It has long been recognized in the law of admiralty that for many, if not most purposes the bareboat charterer is to be treated as the owner, generally called the owner pro hoc vice.’); Alex L. Parks & Edward V. Cattel, Jr., The Law of Tug, Tow & Pilotage 875 (3d ed.1994). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has stated:
This rule recognizes that when the owner of the vessel enters into a demise charter, he surrenders all possession and control of the vessel to the charterer. Since he no longer has the right to control the use of the vessel, he is no longer charged with the duties and liabilities of its ownership. Conversely, the demise charterer ‘becomes subject to the duties and responsibilities of ownership.’
Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Law, 479 F.2d 61, 63 (4th Cir.1973) (quoting Leary v. United States, 81 U.S. (14 Wall) 607, 610, 20 L.Ed. 756 (1872)). As a bareboat charterer, the charterer is held to be a bailee of the vessel. Richmond Sand & Gravel Corp. v. Tidewater Constr. Corp., 170 F.2d 392, 393 (4th Cir.1948); 2b Benedict on Admiralty § 51, at 3-3 (1995).”
See Forrester v. Ocean Marine Indem. Co., 11 F.3d 1213, 1215 (5th Cir.1993) (“In a demise charter, the vessel owner transfers full possession and control to the charterer, who in turn furnishes the crew and maintenance for the vessel (thus the term ‘bare-boat’).”). And as stated in Wolsiffer v. Atlantis Submarines, Inc., 848 F.Supp. 1489, 1494 (D.Haw.1994):
“In order for the agreement to be considered a demise charter, complete transfer of possession, command, and navigation of the vessel from the owner to the charterer is necessary. Guzman v. Pichirilo, 369 U.S. 698, 700, 82 S.Ct. 1095, 1096-97, 8 L.Ed.2d 205 (1962); Gaspard v. Diamond M. Drilling Co., 593 F.2d 605, 606 (5th Cir.1979). ‘Anything short of ... a complete transfer is a time or voyage charter party or not a charter party at all.’ Guzman, 369 U.S. at 700, 82 S.Ct. at 1096. Courts are reluctant to find a demise char ter when the dealings between the parties are consistent with any lesser relationship.”
The owner of a vessel impliedly warrants its seaworthiness to the point of delivery to the bareboat charterer. Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Law, 479 F.2d 61 (4th Cir.1973); Dow Chemical Co. v. Texaco Refining and Marketing, Inc., 887 F.Supp. at 864, citing, Dempsey v. Downing, 11 F.2d 15, 17 (4th Cir.1926); In the Matter of D & H Corp., 1994 WL 574143, *1 (E.D.Va.1993); Cos v. French-Polish Shipping Co., 1986 WL 13361, *1 (D.Md.1986); Interocean Shipping Co. v. M/V Lygaria, 512 F.Supp. 960 (D.Md.1981). If the vessel was unseaworthy when delivered, the owner is liable for injuries caused by such unseaworthiness notwithstanding the existence of the bareboat charter. If the vessel is seaworthy upon delivery, the bareboat charterer then assumes the responsibilities of the owner for liability for injuries thereafter caused by the unseaworthiness of the vessel. McAleer v. Smith, supra, 57 F.3d at 112 (“In general, if there is an owner pro hac vice, the title owner will be absolved of personal liability (except for defective conditions that existed before the owner pro hac vice took control of the vessel).”); Forrester v. Ocean Marine Indem. Co., 11 F.3d at 1215 (“The demise charterer is ... responsible in personam for the negligence of the crew and the unseaworthiness of the vessel.”); Wolsiffer v. Atlantis Submarines, Inc., 848 F.Supp. at 1494 (“The remedy of unseaworthiness for an injured seaman applies in rem against the vessel and in personam against either the title owner of the vessel ..., or the owner pro hac vice under a demise charter.” (citation omitted).).
Plaintiff acknowledges the existence of the bareboat charter agreement and does not dispute the bareboat agreement has the effect of giving Chaplin the status of owner pro hac vice. Plaintiff argues Mon River is liable for the alleged unseaworthiness of the vessel, however, by virtue of the “charter party” agreement executed between Chaplin and Mon River the same day the bareboat charter agreement was executed. Plaintiff argues that pursuant to the charter party agreement, Mon River controlled Chaplin and the vessel, and is thus liable for its alleged unseaworthiness. Defendants, on the other hand, contend the agreement was a “time charter” agreement that left control and possession of the vessel solely in the hands of Chaplin, the pro hac vice owner under the bareboat agreement.
The second agreement entered into by the parties is entitled “Charter Party.” In the first paragraph of the agreement, the contract purports to be a “Time Charter.” Plaintiff acknowledges the time charter did not place any responsibility upon Mon River to furnish the crew or man the vessel. Instead, he relies only on paragraph six of the agreement, which states:
“6. REPORTS: Chaplin shall require that the master of the towboat report daily by radio the position of the tow and any other information that it is requested by [Mon River] regarding the status of the barges that it has or has had in tow. Chaplin shall require that the master of the towboat report weekly by radio the engine hours of the two main engines and the two generator engines on the boat. Chaplin shall furnish to Mon River copies of all purchases of fuel oil, lubricating oil and hydraulic oil which are purchased for consumption aboard the towboat M/V Lillian G. Mon River Towing will pay said vendors of such oils directly.”
Plaintiff suggests the foregoing, combined with his contention that the vessel frequently refueled and underwent engine maintenance at a location operated by Mon River, is enough to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the control of the vessel for liability purposes. The Court disagrees.
In contrast to a bareboat charter, a time charter does not vest operational control in the time charterer. Instead, the time charterer directs the destinations of the vessel without assuming any responsibility for the actual operation of the ship. Therefore, the time charterer is not held hable for the negligence of the crew or the unseaworthiness of the vessel. As stated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit:
“A time charter only entitles the charterer to the use of the vessel for a specified time. The vessel owner retains primary possession and control. Although a time charterer does direct the destinations of the vessel, he does not control the details of vessel operation required to reach those destinations. As a non-demise charterer, the time charterer is thus not liable for claims of negligence of the crew or for the unseaworthiness of the vessel. But the time charterer may be liable in that capacity for his own negligence.” (footnotes omitted and emphasis added). Forrester v. Ocean Marine Indem. Co., 11 F.3d at 1215.
In Moore v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 912 F.2d at 791-92, the Court distinguished the responsibilities of time charterers from those of owners as follows:
“Under the traditional time-charter agreement, the time charterer directs the vessel’s commercial activities. It may designate the cargo to be carried and determine the vessel’s routes and destinations. * * * The time charterer’s duties are different from the vessel owner’s duties. The vessel owner remains responsible for the seaworthiness of the vessel, e.g., Nichimen Co. v. M.V. Farland, 462 F.2d 319, 331 (2nd Cir.1972), dangerous conditions on board, e.g., Migut v. Hyman-Michaels Co., 571 F.2d 352, 356 (6th Cir.1978), navigational errors by the pilot and negligence by the crew, e.g., Delta Transload, Inc. v. MV Navios Commander, 818 F.2d 445, 451 (5th Cir.1987), and a reasonably safe means of access for those boarding or leaving the vessel, see, e.g., Tittle v. Aldacosta, 544 F.2d 752, 755 (5th Cir.1977) [.]”
See Wolsiffer v. Atlantis Submarines, Inc., 848 F.Supp. at 1494; Roby v. Hyundai Merchant Marine, 700 F.Supp. 316, 320-21 (E.D.La.1988); Vlachos v. M/V Proso, 637 F.Supp. 1354, 1364 n. 14 (D.Md.1986).
As noted above, the Plaintiff acknowledges the delegation of responsibilities pursuant to the bareboat charter. Under said agreement, Mon River transferred possession, control and command of the Lillian G to Chaplin. Chaplin thus became the pro hoc vice owner of the vessel, legally responsible for the unseaworthiness of the vessel after the date of transfer. Chaplin, in turn, executed a purported time charter agreement with Mon River. Although Plaintiff argues the time charter had the effect of a demise charter transferring control over the vessel back to Mon River, the Court disagrees.
In essence, it appears Plaintiff is arguing Chaplin, after becoming the bareboat charterer and pro hac vice owner, executed a bareboat charter back to Mon River, making Mon River both paper owner and pro hac vice owner of the vessel. The Court notes the following: first, Plaintiff does not dispute Chaplin was a bareboat charterer under the first agreement, and therefore pro hac vice owner of the vessel; second, in regard to the second agreement between Chaplin and Mon River a time charter, rather than a bareboat charter, is presumed to exist as a matter of law and such presumption may be overcome only by specific facts showing a demise charter existed, Wolsijfer, supra, 848 F.Supp. at 1494, citing Gaspard v. Diamond M. Drilling Co., 593 F.2d 605, 607 (5th Cir.1979); third, the charter is an unrebutted time charter.
Plaintiff has been unable to present specific facts showing a demise charter was executed between Chaplin and Mon River after Mon River demised the vessel to Chaplin. The Court thus concludes the time charter is precisely what it purports to be. Therefore, because Chaplin, the pro hac vice owner of the boat, was responsible for the seaworthiness of the vessel on the date of the Plaintiff’s injury, the Court GRANTS Mon River’s motion for summary judgment on the unseaworthiness claim against it.
III.
Chaplin contends it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff failed to produce evidence the vessel was unseaworthy or that Chaplin was negligent. Plaintiff has attached several portions of depositions he asserts create a question of material fact regarding the seaworthiness of the Lillian G at the time of the incident and of Chaplin’s negligence.
Claims of negligence under the Jones Act or of unseaworthiness subject the plaintiff to a light burden of proof. As stated by the Court of Appeals in Estate of Larkins v. Farrell Lines, Inc., 806 F.2d 510, 512 (4th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1037, 107 S.Ct. 1973, 95 L.Ed.2d 814 (1987):
“Under the Jones Act, the standard of recovery has not been a strict one, and seamen have been afforded the ‘judicially developed doctrine of liability granted to railroad workers by the FELA,’ Kernan v. American Dredging Co., 355 U.S. 426, 439, 78 S.Ct. 394, 401, 2 L.Ed.2d 382 (1958), including its light burden of proof on negligence and causation. While the standard of causation for unseaworthiness is ‘more demanding,’ Chisholm v. Sabine Towing and Transportation Co., 679 F.2d 60, 62 (5th Cir.1982), the plaintiff’s burden in either case has been characterized as light. Vallot v. Central Gulf Lines, 641 F.2d 347, 350 (5th Cir.1981). The jury’s role, moreover, has been an important one in such cases, and doubts have been resolved in favor of submission.”
A.
A comprehensive but concise overview of an owner’s responsibility for a vessel’s seaworthiness was provided in Drachenberg v. Canal Barge Co., Inc., 571 F.2d 912, 918 (5th Cir.1978):
“The owner of the vessel has a duty to provide a vessel that is reasonably fit for its intended use. This duty to provide a seaworthy vessel requires that the vessel, its gear, appurtenances, and operation must be reasonably safe. Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki 1946, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099, 1946 A.M.C. 698. ‘That (a vessel) owner is liable to indemnify a seaman for an injury caused by the unseaworthiness of the vessel or its appurtenant appliances and equipment has been settled law in this country ever since The Osceola, 189 U.S. 158, 23 S.Ct. 483, 47 L.Ed. 760; Mahnich v. Southern S.S. Co., 321 U.S. 96, 99, 64 S.Ct. 455, [457] 88 L.Ed. 561, 564, [ (1944) ] and authorities cited.’ Id. at 90, 66 S.Ct. 872, at 875, 90 L.Ed. at 1103.

Looking at the present bill, it appears that the receiver is attempting to circumvent the established legal framework which explicitly requires actions to be brought in a certain manner. According to the reference cases 8 Wall. 498 and 19 L. Ed. 476, the receiver, as the statutory assignee, holds the proper authority to institute suits both at law and in equity, representing the association and creditors alike without needing to make either a party to the suit.

Furthermore, as highlighted in 38 S. Ct. 38 and 62 L. Ed. 185, the liability of each stockholder constitutes a separate controversy, reducing the necessity for equity jurisdiction. The courts have consistently held, as noted in 8 Wall. 505 and 179 F. 32, that the receiver must proceed through appropriate legal channels rather than seeking to enforce stock subscriptions in this manner.

Notably, in 23 L. Ed. 220, similar principles were applied, emphasizing the requirement of proceeding through statutory methods rather than ancillary suits. The court has repeatedly insisted on adherence to legal forms and prescribed remedies, making the dismissal of the current bill consistent with established precedents.

In summation, the dismissal aligns with the necessity to respect the statutory roles and jurisdictional boundaries, reinforcing that the proper course for the receiver is to petition within the existing receivership suit.

If they choose to rest supine until cases against them like this are on trial, they must take the consequences. Not having spoken before, they cannot be permitted to speak then, especially to make an objection which looks rather to the embarrassment and delay than to the right and justice of the case. A different rule would be pregnant with mischief and confusion. Hall v. U. S. Ins. Co., 5. Gill, 484; Sagory v. Dubois, 3 Sandf. Ch. 510. This court has applied the same rule to an order made by the comptroller of the currency, under the fiftieth section of the National Bank Act, appointing a receiver, and directing him to proceed to make collections from the stockholders of an insolvent bank.

Its validity is not to be questioned in the litigation that may ensue. He may make it at such time as he may deem proper, and upon such data as shall be satisfactory to him.” This principle was applied also in Cadle, Receiver, v. Baker & Co., 20 Wall. 650.

stock and the enforcement of an assessment less than his total liability, such as is disclosed in the present case. It is true that in Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498, 19 L. Ed. 476, which was a suit by a receiver of an insolvent national bank, appointed under the national banking act of June 3, 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 99, to enforce the personal liability of some of the stockholders, the court said: “The liability of the stockholders is several and not joint. The limit of their liability is the par of the stock held by each one. Where the whole amount is sought to be recovered the proceeding must be at law. Where less is required the proceeding may be in equity, and in such case an interlocutory decree may be taken for contribution, and the case may stand over for the further action of the court — if such action should subsequently prove to be necessary — until the full amount of the liability is exhausted.” This statement was unnecessary to the determination of the question before the court, as the bill sought to enforce the full statutory liability, and the case was decided on the ground that it did not appear that the comptroller of the currency had taken any action touching the enforcement of the personal liability of the stockholders. -Further, the pasáage must be read in the light of the law and facts there involved, and when so read is inapplicable to the

This is an ap- . peal from a decree dismissing a bill, called an ancillary bill, brought by the receiver of the Midland Packing Company against a large number of defendants, to enforce collection from them on their alleged unpaid stock subscriptions in said company. A brief outline of the facts leading up to the present bill is as follows:
The Midland Packing Company was organized under the laws of the state of Iowa in 1918 to carry on a general meat-packing business. The original authorized capital stock was $3,500,000. By an amendment to its articles, this was increased to $8,000,000. About $3,000,00 of the stock was purchased and paid for; $5,000,000 more was subscribed for, on which about $2,000,000 was paid, leaving approximately $3,000,000 unpaid on the stock subscriptions. In connection with these subscriptions for stock," cash payments were generally made for part of the purchase price, and promissory notes were given for the balance. These-notes to an amount of more than $1,000,000 were negotiated by the Midland Packing Company, either by way of sale or by way-of pledge, and to a very large amount they are still outstanding. The company built a. packing plant at Sioux City, Iowa, at a cost of over $3,000,000.
In April, 1920, Peter Hegnes, a citizen of South Dakota, brought a suit in equity in the federal court for the Northern District of Iowa against the Midland Packing Company, alleging that he was a stockholder in the company; that the company had. by fraud secured promissory notes from. him and from many others for the purchase of stock in the company; that the company was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency; that it had no funds on hand for a working capital. He prayed for a rescission of the contract of purchase of the stock, for an injunction against the sale of the promissory notes given by him, for a receiver for the company, and for general relief. A general receiver was appointed' by the court, and possession was taken by him of all the assets of the company for the purpose of winding up its affairs as an insolvent corporation. The receivership thus inaugurated still continues, the assets of the company have been largely collected, claims have been filed and allowed, and the affairs of the company generally administered.
In 1922, the receiver, McMillan, commenced a suit in the court of his appointment, called an ancillary suit, against a large number of defendants, divided by the bill into two classes, stockholder defendants and creditor defendants. The bill alleged that the stockholder defendants had each entered into a contract for the purchase of stock in the Midland Packing Company; “that at the time of entering into said eon-tracts each of the said stockholder defendants executed and delivered to the Midland Packing Company his promissory note or notes for the unpaid balance of the stock so subscribed for by him, and that a large part of the notes so executed and received by the said company were indorsed by it, and sold and transferred, in the due course of business, to the creditor defendants, * * * who are now the owners and holders thereof in due course.” The hill further alleged that part of the notes were held by the creditor defendants as collateral security for money loaned to the Midland Packing Company; that claims aggregating $2,173,-477 had been filed against the company in the receivership proceedings and had been approved; that the total claims filed amounted approximately to $3,400,270; that the total amount of unpaid notes on the subscriptions to. the stock of the company was $3,062,650, of which amount about 50 per cent, was uncollectable; that the plant of the company could not be sold for more than 50 per cent, of its actual appraised value, $2,522,931.
The prayer was “that the amount due and owing from each of the said stockholder defendants, on their several contracts, referred to in this bill of complaint, be ascertained and established by the court, for the several amounts, as shown by Schedule A, or for, such amounts as the court shall find to be due from them, and that the judgment and decree of this court be rendered against e'ach of said defendants for the amount so found to be due from them, and that the assets be marshaled and equitably distributed, so as to equalize the loss among the' stockholders, and for such further decree in that hehalf as shall preserve the rights of all the parties interested therein,- * * * and that each and all of the said creditor defendants be required to bring into court and surrender to the receiver each and all of the notes so held by them, or either or any of them, to the end that the notes may be fully accounted for and b& surrendered to the stockholder defendants upon payment thereof, or surrendered for cancellation in connection with any judgment or decree that may be entered herein against them, and the plaintiff prays such other and further relief as the court may deem just and equitable in the premises.”
It was held by this court (Carey v. McMillan, 289 F. 380) that thei hill should be dismissed. The court in its opinion said:
“To sum np: The demand made against each defendant being/purely legal, each demand being independent of every other, the amount demanded against each being the full amount unpaid on the stock, no accounting being necessary, no contribution being necessary, community of interest of the defendants in all the important questions of law and fact involved not being shown and being highly improbable, we are of opinion that the bare multiplicity of suits is not sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to entertain the present bill in equity. The plain and adequate remedy at law open to the receiver is to bring ancillary actions at law in the federal court against the several defendants whose notes he holds. When the pleadings are made up, if it is found feasible and desirable to consolidate the suits into one or several groups for trial, the power of the court is ample for that purpose. The convenience of the parties can thus he served, the cost of the litigation need not by appreciably greater, and the right of trial by jury will be preserved.”
In 1923 a suit in equity was brought in the same court by John A. Reagan, as trustee, against the same defendants (stock subscribers) as in the McMillan hill. Reagan alleged in his bill that he was a judgment creditor, having obtained a judgment in the state court of Iowa upon the indorsement of certain promissory notes by the Midland Packing Company which were made to it by subscribers to its stock; that execution had been returned unsatisfied; that the company was insolvent; that claims existed against the company, of th& same class as plaintiff’s claim, amounting to more than $1,750,000; that there were other claims, of a class inferior, amounting to more than $2,000,000; that the receiver had sold the plant and other assets, and had collected sufficient proceeds to pay 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, to creditors of the same class as plaintiff. ■
The prayer of the bill was “for an accounting to fix and determine the assets and liabilities of the Midland Packing Company and the amount of its unpaid stock subscriptions, and that the court shall fix and determine the percentage of his unpaid stock subscriptions which each defendant stockholder, shall pay, and the amount of the fair and equitable contribution of each defendant herein for the payment of the debts of said corporation, and that by said decree judgment shall be rendered and entered against each defendant for a sufficient amount of his unpaid stock subscriptions to in the aggregate pay the claim of this plaintiff against the Midland Packing Company, and those of all other creditors similarly situated, together with interest and its costs and disbursement^ in this action, and that it may have decree for such other and further relief as shall seem just and equitable in the premises.”
The court below dismissed the bill, on the ground that, since there was a receiver already in possession of the assets of the company and administering the same, the suit by Reagan would be an interference with the possession ■ of the court, and therefore could not be maintained. 298 F. 500. This judgment of dismissal was affirmed by this court in Reagan v. Midland Packing Co., 8 F. (2d) 954, decision filed September 30, 1925.
In 1924 after the dismissal of the Reagan suit in the lower court, the present suit was brought by the receiver against the same defendants (stock subscribers) as in the McMillan and Reagan bills. The bill alleges the history'of the company and the issue of its stock as above set forth, the insolvency of the company, the appointment of the receiver, and the administration by him of the assets of the company, the collection of proceeds sufficient to pay 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, to general creditors, whose claims have been allowed, and the existence of the unpaid stock subscriptions. The prayer is substantially the same as in the Reagan bill above quoted. The present bill was dismissed by the trial court.
It is claimed by the appellees that the decision in Carey v. McMillan (C. C. A.) 289 F. 380, is decisive of the present suit,, and that the question of the inability of the receiver to maintain the present suit is res ad judicata. Appellant claims that there are radical differences between the allegations of the bill in the McMillan suit and those in the present bill, and that the decision in the former suit is in no way opposed to the maintenance of the present one.
There are, it is true, numerous differences between, the bill in the McMillan suit and the present bill. Some of them consist of different allegations in reference to the same subject-matter; some of them consist in omitting altogether from the present bill' allegations found in the McMillan bill. The parties defendant are not strictly tlie same. In the McMillan suit not only the subscribers to stock were made defendants, but also-the holders of notes given by such subscribers to the Midland Packing Company for the purchase of stock, and which notes had been negotiated by the Midland Packing Company, either by a sale outright or by being pledged as collateral to debts of the Midland Packing Company. In the present suit these creditor defendants have been omitted. In the present suit there is an additional defendant, the Midland Packing Company.
In the McMillan suit it was alleged that claims had been filed in “the amount of $3,-400,270, and that claims had been approved to the amount of $2,173,477. In the present bill, the claims approved are stated to-amount to $1,760,000, a difference of $413,r 000. No explanation is given in the bill' of this difference in. amount of approved claims. In the McMillan bill it is stated that notes had been given in part payment for the stock subscribed by the defendant stockholders. No such allegation is found in the present bill. The present suit is based, in theory at least, not upon the notes,, but upon the stock subscriptions.
In the McMillan 'bill it was alleged that of the notes outstanding, given by stock subscribers in Iowa, $247,876 were held and owned by the receiver, whieh left upwards of $1,000,000 either owned or held as collateral by third parties. In the present bill it is stated that the stock subscriptions are in the possession of the receiver, but it is not stated whether any of the notes given in connection with stock subscriptions are in the possession or under the control of said receiver. In the McMillan hill it is stated that probably less than 50 per cent, of the notes given in connection with stock subscriptions were collectable. In tbe present bill nothing is said as to tbe amount of uncollectable notes or uneollectable stock subscriptions.
Nowhere in the present bill is it stated directly that less than the full amount owing on the stock subscriptions wiE be necessary in order to pay the debts and the administration expenses. It is sought, however, to have the inference drawn from the allegations in reference to the necessity for assessments that the total amount due on the subscriptions will not be neeessary. In the MeMillan bill, it is stated unequivocally that the fuE .amount due on the notes given in connection with stock subscriptions will be necessary in orders to meet tbe debts and administration expenses.
No explanation is found in the present bill of these vital differences in the statement of facts in the two bills. No reason is given in tbe present bill for tbe omission to state important facts which appear in the MeMillan bill, and which have a bearing on the propriety of maintaining the present suit. Both the MeMiEan bill and the present bill are verified. The court below, in determining tbe motion to dismiss, doubtless considered tbe allegations of the McMillan biE, so- far as they supplemented $he allegations of the present bill, and so far as they were relevant to the question of tbe propriety of maintaining tbe present suit. Both bills are of record in this court, and we are at liberty to consider them both in passing upon the action of the court below.
When the present bill is considered in tbe light of the unexplained and unchallenged allegations of fact in the MeMiEan bill, we think there is much basis for the contention that the question of the maintenance of the present suit is governed by the decision in the McMillan suit. See Sapulpa Petroleum Co. v. McCray (C. C. A.) 4 F.(2d) 645. But it is contended that the allegations of the present bill only should be considered, in determining the propriety of the present suit, and that, when the present hill is considered independently, several important facts show the necessity for the present suit: (1) That the liability on the stock subscriptions, and hot on the promissory notes given in connection therewith, is sought to be enforced; (2) that the whole amount of liability is not sought to be enforced, but only sucb proportional part as tbe court shall determine is neeessary; (3) that an accounting is necessary to determine the assets and liabilities of tbe company, tbe creditors» who are entitled to share in the fund to be created by tbe collection of the unpaid subscriptions, and the percentage neeessary to be paid by each subscriber on the unpaid balance on his subscription in order to meet the claims of creditors; and (4) that such an accounting can he had only in a court of equity. We do not think that any or aE of these contentions justify the maintenance of the present suit. We do not, however, find it necessary to decide whether the question of such maintenance is res adjudicata by reason of the decision in Carey v. McMillan (C. C. A.) 289 F. 380, nor do we find it necessary to determine whether the Eahility of the stock subscribers should be determined in suits on the promissory notes given by them or on the stock subscription contracts. The demand in either instance is a legal one, and the character of the demand is not changed by reason of the fact that the liability of the defendants may not have to be enforced to the full extent.
The real question is whether, in view-of all the facts, the bringing of the present bill by the receiver is in accordance with proper practice. It may he conceded that findings are necessary' as to the amount of assets and of liabilities of the Midland Packing Company, and the amount of total unpaid stock subscriptions,' as also a determination of the proportional amount to he enforced against each stock subscriber, and it may be further conceded-that such findings ought properly to he made by a court of equity. But a suit in equity is already pending in the same court in which the present bill is brought. The Midland Packing Company is a party to that suit. All of the above steps can be taken in that existing receivership suit on a petition by the receiver. The stockholders are not necessary formal parties to such proceedings. They are represented by the corporation itself, which is a party to the suit. 6 Fletcher Cyc. Corp. § 4120; Hawkins v. Glenn, 131 U. S. 319, 9 S. Ct. 739, 33 L. Ed. 184; Glenn v. Liggett, 135 U.

The case at hand involves a receiver's attempt to enforce the personal liability of stockholders in a insolvent corporation. The receiver brought a bill in equity against the stockholders, seeking to establish the amount due on their unpaid stock subscriptions and to require each stockholder to pay a proportional part of the unpaid balance. The court dismissed the bill, citing the decision in Carey v. McMillan (C. C. A.) 289 F. 380, which held that the receiver's suit was premature and that the stockholders should be required to bring separate actions at law to enforce their claims.

In considering the present suit, the court noted that there were significant differences between the allegations in the bill and those in the McMillan suit. For example, the present bill omitted allegations about the notes given by stock subscribers to the corporation, and it did not state the amount of uncollectable notes or uncollectable stock subscriptions. The court also noted that the present bill did not explain the differences in the statements of facts in the two bills.

Despite these differences, the court held that the decision in the McMillan suit controlled the present case. The court found that the receiver's suit was premature and that the stockholders should be required to bring separate actions at law to enforce their claims. The court also noted that the stockholders were not necessary formal parties to the receivership suit, and that they were represented by the corporation itself.

In reaching its decision, the court relied on several precedents, including Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498, 19 L. Ed. 476, which held that the liability of stockholders is several and not joint, and that the limit of their liability is the par value of the stock held by each one. The court also cited Hall v. U. S. Ins. Co., 5 Gill, 484, which held that a receiver appointed by the comptroller of the currency has the power to institute proceedings against the stockholders of an insolvent bank.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the present case is consistent with the decision in Carey v. McMillan, and it is also supported by the precedents cited above. The court's holding that the receiver's suit is premature and that the stockholders should be required to bring separate actions at law to enforce their claims is reasonable and consistent with the principles of equity and fairness.

seek their remedy through the comptroller in the mode prescribed by the statute; they cannot proceed directly in their own names against the stockholders or debtors of the bank. The receiver is the statutory assignee of the association, and is the proper party to institute all suits; they may be brought both at law and in equity, in his name, or in the name of the association for his use. He represents both the creditors and the association, and when he sues in his own name it is not necessary to make either a party to the suit. The 59th section of the act of February 25th, 1863, provides that all suits by or against such associations may be brought in the proper courts of the United States or of the State. The 57th section of the act of 1864, relates to .the same subject, and revises and enlarges the provisions of the 59th section of the preceding act. In the latter, the word “by” in respect to such suits is dropped. The omission was doubtless accidental.

seek their remedy through the comptroller in the mode prescribed by the statute; they cannot proceed directly in their own names against the stockholders or debtors of the bank. The receiver is the statutory assignee of the association, and is the proper party to institute all suits; they may be brought both at law and in equity, in his name, or in the name of the association for his use. He represents both the creditors and the association, and when he sues in his own name it is not necessary to make either a party to the suit. The 59th section of the act of February 25th, 1863, provides that all suits by or against such associations may be brought in the proper courts of the United States or of the State. The 57th section of the act of 1864, relates to .the same subject, and revises and enlarges the provisions of the 59th section of the preceding act. In the latter, the word “by” in respect to such suits is dropped. The omission was doubtless accidental.

If they choose to rest supine until cases against them like this are on trial, they must take the consequences. Not having spoken before, they cannot be permitted to speak then, especially to make an objection which looks rather to the embarrassment and delay than to the right and justice of the case. A different rule would be pregnant with mischief and confusion. Hall v. U. S. Ins. Co., 5. Gill, 484; Sagory v. Dubois, 3 Sandf. Ch. 510. This court has applied the same rule to an order made by the comptroller of the currency, under the fiftieth section of the National Bank Act, appointing a receiver, and directing him to proceed to make collections from the stockholders of an insolvent bank. Kennedy v. Gibson and Others, 8 Wall. 505. In that case it was said, “It is .for the comptroller, to decide when it is necessary to institute proceedings against the stockholders to enforce their persons,1 liability, and whether the whole or any part, and, if a part, how much, should be collected. These questions are referred to his judgment and discretion, and his determination is conclusive. The stockholders cannot controvert it. Its validity is not to be questioned in the litigation that may ensue. He may make it at such time as he may deem proper, and upon such data as shall be satisfactory to him.” This principle was applied also in Cadle, Receiver, v. Baker & Co., 20 Wall. 650.

There was no common issue between these alleged stockholders and the corporation; and the liability of each would have presented a separate controversy unconnected with that of any other. Thus elements essential to jurisdiction in equity to avoid multiplicity of actions at law by the corporations were lacking. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. McKnight, 244 U.

For him., also, the appropriate remedy was a separate action at law against each stockholder. The amendment of 1910 to § 47 of the Bankruptcy Act did not confer new means of collecting ordinary claims due the bankrupt; and the order directing the trustee “to institute a suit in equity” was impotent to confer equity jurisdiction.

stock and the enforcement of an assessment less than his total liability, such as is disclosed in the present case. It is true that in Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498, 19 L. Ed. 476, which was a suit by a receiver of an insolvent national bank, appointed under the national banking act of June 3, 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 99, to enforce the personal liability of some of the stockholders, the court said: “The liability of the stockholders is several and not joint. The limit of their liability is the par of the stock held by each one. Where the whole amount is sought to be recovered the proceeding must be at law. Where less is required the proceeding may be in equity, and in such case an interlocutory decree may be taken for contribution, and the case may stand over for the further action of the court — if such action should subsequently prove to be necessary — until the full amount of the liability is exhausted.” This statement was unnecessary to the determination of the question before the court, as the bill sought to enforce the full statutory liability, and the case was decided on the ground that it did not appear that the comptroller of the currency had taken any action touching the enforcement of the personal liability of the stockholders. -Further, the pasáage must be read in the light of the law and facts there involved, and when so read is inapplicable to the

This is an ap- . peal from a decree dismissing a bill, called an ancillary bill, brought by the receiver of the Midland Packing Company against a large number of defendants, to enforce collection from them on their alleged unpaid stock subscriptions in said company. A brief outline of the facts leading up to the present bill is as follows:
The Midland Packing Company was organized under the laws of the state of Iowa in 1918 to carry on a general meat-packing business. The original authorized capital stock was $3,500,000. By an amendment to its articles, this was increased to $8,000,000. About $3,000,00 of the stock was purchased and paid for; $5,000,000 more was subscribed for, on which about $2,000,000 was paid, leaving approximately $3,000,000 unpaid on the stock subscriptions. In connection with these subscriptions for stock," cash payments were generally made for part of the purchase price, and promissory notes were given for the balance. These-notes to an amount of more than $1,000,000 were negotiated by the Midland Packing Company, either by way of sale or by way-of pledge, and to a very large amount they are still outstanding. The company built a. packing plant at Sioux City, Iowa, at a cost of over $3,000,000.
In April, 1920, Peter Hegnes, a citizen of South Dakota, brought a suit in equity in the federal court for the Northern District of Iowa against the Midland Packing Company, alleging that he was a stockholder in the company; that the company had. by fraud secured promissory notes from. him and from many others for the purchase of stock in the company; that the company was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency; that it had no funds on hand for a working capital. He prayed for a rescission of the contract of purchase of the stock, for an injunction against the sale of the promissory notes given by him, for a receiver for the company, and for general relief. A general receiver was appointed' by the court, and possession was taken by him of all the assets of the company for the purpose of winding up its affairs as an insolvent corporation. The receivership thus inaugurated still continues, the assets of the company have been largely collected, claims have been filed and allowed, and the affairs of the company generally administered.
In 1922, the receiver, McMillan, commenced a suit in the court of his appointment, called an ancillary suit, against a large number of defendants, divided by the bill into two classes, stockholder defendants and creditor defendants. The bill alleged that the stockholder defendants had each entered into a contract for the purchase of stock in the Midland Packing Company; “that at the time of entering into said eon-tracts each of the said stockholder defendants executed and delivered to the Midland Packing Company his promissory note or notes for the unpaid balance of the stock so subscribed for by him, and that a large part of the notes so executed and received by the said company were indorsed by it, and sold and transferred, in the due course of business, to the creditor defendants, * * * who are now the owners and holders thereof in due course.” The hill further alleged that part of the notes were held by the creditor defendants as collateral security for money loaned to the Midland Packing Company; that claims aggregating $2,173,-477 had been filed against the company in the receivership proceedings and had been approved; that the total claims filed amounted approximately to $3,400,270; that the total amount of unpaid notes on the subscriptions to. the stock of the company was $3,062,650, of which amount about 50 per cent, was uncollectable; that the plant of the company could not be sold for more than 50 per cent, of its actual appraised value, $2,522,931.
The prayer was “that the amount due and owing from each of the said stockholder defendants, on their several contracts, referred to in this bill of complaint, be ascertained and established by the court, for the several amounts, as shown by Schedule A, or for, such amounts as the court shall find to be due from them, and that the judgment and decree of this court be rendered against e'ach of said defendants for the amount so found to be due from them, and that the assets be marshaled and equitably distributed, so as to equalize the loss among the' stockholders, and for such further decree in that hehalf as shall preserve the rights of all the parties interested therein,- * * * and that each and all of the said creditor defendants be required to bring into court and surrender to the receiver each and all of the notes so held by them, or either or any of them, to the end that the notes may be fully accounted for and b& surrendered to the stockholder defendants upon payment thereof, or surrendered for cancellation in connection with any judgment or decree that may be entered herein against them, and the plaintiff prays such other and further relief as the court may deem just and equitable in the premises.”
It was held by this court (Carey v. McMillan, 289 F. 380) that thei hill should be dismissed. The court in its opinion said:
“To sum np: The demand made against each defendant being/purely legal, each demand being independent of every other, the amount demanded against each being the full amount unpaid on the stock, no accounting being necessary, no contribution being necessary, community of interest of the defendants in all the important questions of law and fact involved not being shown and being highly improbable, we are of opinion that the bare multiplicity of suits is not sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to entertain the present bill in equity. The plain and adequate remedy at law open to the receiver is to bring ancillary actions at law in the federal court against the several defendants whose notes he holds. When the pleadings are made up, if it is found feasible and desirable to consolidate the suits into one or several groups for trial, the power of the court is ample for that purpose. The convenience of the parties can thus he served, the cost of the litigation need not by appreciably greater, and the right of trial by jury will be preserved.”
In 1923 a suit in equity was brought in the same court by John A. Reagan, as trustee, against the same defendants (stock subscribers) as in the McMillan hill. Reagan alleged in his bill that he was a judgment creditor, having obtained a judgment in the state court of Iowa upon the indorsement of certain promissory notes by the Midland Packing Company which were made to it by subscribers to its stock; that execution had been returned unsatisfied; that the company was insolvent; that claims existed against the company, of th& same class as plaintiff’s claim, amounting to more than $1,750,000; that there were other claims, of a class inferior, amounting to more than $2,000,000; that the receiver had sold the plant and other assets, and had collected sufficient proceeds to pay 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, to creditors of the same class as plaintiff. ■
The prayer of the bill was “for an accounting to fix and determine the assets and liabilities of the Midland Packing Company and the amount of its unpaid stock subscriptions, and that the court shall fix and determine the percentage of his unpaid stock subscriptions which each defendant stockholder, shall pay, and the amount of the fair and equitable contribution of each defendant herein for the payment of the debts of said corporation, and that by said decree judgment shall be rendered and entered against each defendant for a sufficient amount of his unpaid stock subscriptions to in the aggregate pay the claim of this plaintiff against the Midland Packing Company, and those of all other creditors similarly situated, together with interest and its costs and disbursement^ in this action, and that it may have decree for such other and further relief as shall seem just and equitable in the premises.”
The court below dismissed the bill, on the ground that, since there was a receiver already in possession of the assets of the company and administering the same, the suit by Reagan would be an interference with the possession ■ of the court, and therefore could not be maintained. 298 F. 500. This judgment of dismissal was affirmed by this court in Reagan v. Midland Packing Co., 8 F. (2d) 954, decision filed September 30, 1925.
In 1924 after the dismissal of the Reagan suit in the lower court, the present suit was brought by the receiver against the same defendants (stock subscribers) as in the McMillan and Reagan bills. The bill alleges the history'of the company and the issue of its stock as above set forth, the insolvency of the company, the appointment of the receiver, and the administration by him of the assets of the company, the collection of proceeds sufficient to pay 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, to general creditors, whose claims have been allowed, and the existence of the unpaid stock subscriptions. The prayer is substantially the same as in the Reagan bill above quoted. The present bill was dismissed by the trial court.
It is claimed by the appellees that the decision in Carey v. McMillan (C. C. A.) 289 F. 380, is decisive of the present suit,, and that the question of the inability of the receiver to maintain the present suit is res ad judicata. Appellant claims that there are radical differences between the allegations of the bill in the McMillan suit and those in the present bill, and that the decision in the former suit is in no way opposed to the maintenance of the present one.
There are, it is true, numerous differences between, the bill in the McMillan suit and the present bill. Some of them consist of different allegations in reference to the same subject-matter; some of them consist in omitting altogether from the present bill' allegations found in the McMillan bill. The parties defendant are not strictly tlie same. In the McMillan suit not only the subscribers to stock were made defendants, but also-the holders of notes given by such subscribers to the Midland Packing Company for the purchase of stock, and which notes had been negotiated by the Midland Packing Company, either by a sale outright or by being pledged as collateral to debts of the Midland Packing Company. In the present suit these creditor defendants have been omitted. In the present suit there is an additional defendant, the Midland Packing Company.
In the McMillan suit it was alleged that claims had been filed in “the amount of $3,-400,270, and that claims had been approved to the amount of $2,173,477. In the present bill, the claims approved are stated to-amount to $1,760,000, a difference of $413,r 000. No explanation is given in the bill' of this difference in. amount of approved claims. In the McMillan bill it is stated that notes had been given in part payment for the stock subscribed by the defendant stockholders. No such allegation is found in the present bill. The present suit is based, in theory at least, not upon the notes,, but upon the stock subscriptions.
In the McMillan 'bill it was alleged that of the notes outstanding, given by stock subscribers in Iowa, $247,876 were held and owned by the receiver, whieh left upwards of $1,000,000 either owned or held as collateral by third parties. In the present bill it is stated that the stock subscriptions are in the possession of the receiver, but it is not stated whether any of the notes given in connection with stock subscriptions are in the possession or under the control of said receiver. In the McMillan hill it is stated that probably less than 50 per cent, of the notes given in connection with stock subscriptions were collectable. In tbe present bill nothing is said as to tbe amount of uncollectable notes or uneollectable stock subscriptions.
Nowhere in the present bill is it stated directly that less than the full amount owing on the stock subscriptions wiE be necessary in order to pay the debts and the administration expenses. It is sought, however, to have the inference drawn from the allegations in reference to the necessity for assessments that the total amount due on the subscriptions will not be neeessary. In the MeMillan bill, it is stated unequivocally that the fuE .amount due on the notes given in connection with stock subscriptions will be necessary in orders to meet tbe debts and administration expenses.
No explanation is found in the present bill of these vital differences in the statement of facts in the two bills. No reason is given in tbe present bill for tbe omission to state important facts which appear in the MeMillan bill, and which have a bearing on the propriety of maintaining the present suit. Both the MeMiEan bill and the present bill are verified. The court below, in determining tbe motion to dismiss, doubtless considered tbe allegations of the McMillan biE, so- far as they supplemented $he allegations of the present bill, and so far as they were relevant to the question of tbe propriety of maintaining tbe present suit. Both bills are of record in this court, and we are at liberty to consider them both in passing upon the action of the court below.
When the present bill is considered in tbe light of the unexplained and unchallenged allegations of fact in the MeMiEan bill, we think there is much basis for the contention that the question of the maintenance of the present suit is governed by the decision in the McMillan suit. See Sapulpa Petroleum Co. v. McCray (C. C. A.) 4 F.(2d) 645. But it is contended that the allegations of the present bill only should be considered, in determining the propriety of the present suit, and that, when the present hill is considered independently, several important facts show the necessity for the present suit: (1) That the liability on the stock subscriptions, and hot on the promissory notes given in connection therewith, is sought to be enforced; (2) that the whole amount of liability is not sought to be enforced, but only sucb proportional part as tbe court shall determine is neeessary; (3) that an accounting is necessary to determine the assets and liabilities of tbe company, tbe creditors» who are entitled to share in the fund to be created by tbe collection of the unpaid subscriptions, and the percentage neeessary to be paid by each subscriber on the unpaid balance on his subscription in order to meet the claims of creditors; and (4) that such an accounting can he had only in a court of equity. We do not think that any or aE of these contentions justify the maintenance of the present suit. We do not, however, find it necessary to decide whether the question of such maintenance is res adjudicata by reason of the decision in Carey v. McMillan (C. C. A.) 289 F. 380, nor do we find it necessary to determine whether the Eahility of the stock subscribers should be determined in suits on the promissory notes given by them or on the stock subscription contracts. The demand in either instance is a legal one, and the character of the demand is not changed by reason of the fact that the liability of the defendants may not have to be enforced to the full extent.
The real question is whether, in view-of all the facts, the bringing of the present bill by the receiver is in accordance with proper practice. It may he conceded that findings are necessary' as to the amount of assets and of liabilities of the Midland Packing Company, and the amount of total unpaid stock subscriptions,' as also a determination of the proportional amount to he enforced against each stock subscriber, and it may be further conceded-that such findings ought properly to he made by a court of equity. But a suit in equity is already pending in the same court in which the present bill is brought. The Midland Packing Company is a party to that suit. All of the above steps can be taken in that existing receivership suit on a petition by the receiver. The stockholders are not necessary formal parties to such proceedings. They are represented by the corporation itself, which is a party to the suit. 6 Fletcher Cyc. Corp. § 4120; Hawkins v. Glenn, 131 U. S. 319, 9 S. Ct. 739, 33 L. Ed. 184; Glenn v. Liggett, 135 U.

The trial court’s instruction on abandonment essentially followed the principles outlined in Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Co., 308 F.2d 403, which highlighted that a trademark owner’s failure to exercise control and supervision over the licensee’s use of the mark might lead to estoppel. However, in this context, it focuses on whether Sweetheart's inaction towards other infringers like Formfit and Douglas Stephens led to an implied abandonment of their rights.

Acts that are generally sufficient to establish abandonment—as noted in Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States and subsequent cases like Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., 179 U.S. 19—can be negated by explaining an actual intent not to relinquish the rights. This is further supported by 486 F.2d 114, where the lack of control and supervision over an extended period may preclude the trademark owner from later contesting usage. Given Sweetheart’s proactive measures against several infringers were documented, the nuanced application of these principles indicates that the trial court may have erred in its wholesale application of abandonment.

In summary, evidence relating to Sweetheart's actions towards other infringers should have been carefully weighed to discern between mere delay and genuine abandonment of trademark rights. The misstep in the jury instruction and subsequent handling of the abandonment defense forms a basis for reversal and remand for a retrial.

target_text: On the other hand, two of the cases relied on by Detroit, Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Company, 308 F.2d 403 (5th Cir.1962); Sheila’s Shine Products, Inc. v. Sheila Shine, Inc., 486 F.2d 114 (5th Cir.1973) are of no help in determining this issue. Those cases merely recognize the rule that a trademark owner’s uncontrolled or “naked” licensing of a mark may result in the trademark ceasing to function as a symbol of quality and controlled origin, which has been characterized as abandonment. This rule of uncontrolled licensing of a trademark is inapplicable to the instant case as no evidence of licensing has been presented. The other case relied on by Detroit, Saxlehner v. Eisener & Mendelson Co., 179 U.S. 19, 21 S.Ct. 7, 45 L.Ed. 60 (1900) does note the remedial actions taken by a trademark owner against other infringers in its discussion of abandonment; however, Saxlehner is factually distinguishable from the instant case because in Saxlehner the plaintiff’s mark “Hunyadi” was found to have become the generic name in this country for a type of water after others had used the name for twenty years without being sued by the plaintiff.

to buy the ticking, innerspring units and labels from sources specified by Spring-Air. In Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, supra, this was said: “For our purposes a tying agreement may be defined as an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on condition that the buyer also purchase a different (or tied) product, or at least agree that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier.” Here, there was no agreement by Spring-Air to sell any of the items involved, nor was there any condition requiring Denison to also purchase a different product from Spring-Air. Instead, the agreement specified sources other than Spring-Air from which Denison should purchase specified materials as a means whereby Spring-Air could control the nature and quality of its own product under its own trademark. The trademark would be of no worth unless the public could be sure that every mattress which bore that mark was uniform both in exterior design and interior quality. Denison must accept the judgment of Spring-Air on this requirement. The record shows that Denison could and did purchase from competitive suppliers all of the innerspring units it desired for use in its private brand products of which its annual volume ranged between one million and three million dollars. It is doubtful that every “tie-in” device is unlawful. Dehydrating Process Co. v. Smith, supra, 292 F.2d 653. We find nothing in the record which requires us to disagree with the findings and conclusions of the

but also a concurrent duty to exercise control and supervision over the licensee’s use of the mark. Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Co., 5 Cir. 1962, 308 F.2d 403, 409. Cf. Kidd v. Johnson, 1879, 100 U.S. 617, 25 L.Ed. 769. Failure to exercise such control and supervision for a significant period of time may estop the trademark owner from challenging the use of the mark and business which the licensee has developed during the period of such unsupervised use. Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Co., supra. This principle is an analogue to the es-toppel against a trademark owner who knowingly sits silently by while infring-ers use his trademark over a significant period of time. Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., 1900, 179 U.S. 19, 21 S. Ct. 7, 45 L.Ed. 60; Dwinell-Wright Co. v. White House Milk Co., 2 Cir. 1943, 132 F.2d 822. The undisputed failure by the MeCaffertys to exercise any supervision or control over the activities of Pan American or its successor SS Florida leads us to hold that SS California is estopped to challenge the business which SS Florida has built up under the mark Sheila Shine. As we develop, infra, however, this estoppel precludes challenge only in the trade area awarded to SS Florida. The lower court also found that the MeCaffertys abandoned any established business in Sheila Shine polish outside the states of California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Hawaii Shortly after the January, 1955 transaction. SS California correctly contends that mere

With regard to the defence of abandonment, it may with confidence be said that there is but very slight evidence of any personal intention on the part of Andreas Saxlehner or his wife to abandon the use of the word “ Hunyadi or dedicate the same to the public, and none at all of an intent to abandon the peculiar bottles and labels in connection with which he sold his waters. In fact, Saxlehner’s whole life was a constant protest against the use by others of the name “ Hunyadi.” He discovered his spring in 1862, and in 1863 obtained permission to give it the name, of Hunyadi Spring. He carried on an uninterrupted trade under that name until 1872. It also appears from the certificate of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that the trade-mark “Hunyadi Janos” was, on December 12, 1872, registered, and that previously to such registration no trade-mark was entered in which the

In this action for injunctive relief for false designation of origin under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) and unfajr competition, plaintiff Sweetheart Plastics, Inc. (Sweetheart) appeals from the judgment entered on the jury verdict in favor 0f defendant Detroit Forming, Inc. (Detroit). Sweetheart claims the district court erred in: (1) denying Sweetheart’s motion to amend its complaint; (2) refusing ac*m^ evidence of actions taken by Sweetheart against other manufacturers of substantially similar designs, and then charging the jury ^ to consider whether Sweetheart, by taking no action against °tber manufacturers, acquiesced in the manufacture of the dishes by others or abandoned its rights; (3) admitting evidence of the existence of other manufacturers of similar designs; (4) charging the jury that evidence of Sweetheart’s delay in taking action against other infringers could be considered relevant to Detroit’s defenses of estoppel by acquiescence and abandonment; (5) submitting Detroit’s defenses to the jury; and (6) refusing to grant a continuance of the trial. Finding that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to permit Sweetheart to amend its complaint under the circumstances; erred ¡n charging the jury that the evidence of Sweetheart’s failure to control other manufacturers could be considered relative to Detroit’s defenses of estoppel by acquiesCence and abandonment; and erroneously submitted the defense of abandonment to the jury, we reverse and remand.

This action concerns a series of four disposable plastic ice cream dishes which have been marketed by Sweetheart for the past twenty-five years. Two are rowboat-shaped dishes for banana splits, and two are bowl-shaped dishes for sundaes. Sweetheart does not have a registered trademark on the dish designs, but does own a registered trademark on the mark “Banana Boat.” Sweetheart alleged in its complaint that by virtue of its having sold billions of the dishes, and spent considerable sums Advertising and promoting them, the designs have come to identify its products as originating from a single source, Sweetheart.
During the 1960’s a company called Van Brode Milling Company (Van Brode) marketed a boat-shaped plastic ice cream dish. This practice was discontinued when Sweetheart asked Van Brode to stop. More recently, three other companies marketed lines of plastic disposable ice cream dishes which were substantially similar in design to Sweetheart’s line. These companies are Formfit Plastics, Inc. (Formfit), Douglas Stephens Plastics, Inc. (Douglas Stephens), and defendant Detroit. In addition to the instant litigation, Sweetheart has filed a companion case in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Douglas Stephens.
On July 19, 1983, six days before trial commenced, Sweetheart received certain documents it had requested from Detroit on January 28, 1983. Although the documents were ones in which Detroit had claimed that trade secrets were contained, a stipulated protective order had been entered by the court on June 9, 1983 which provided that confidential documents filed with the court would be sealed and segregated in the court’s files. One of the documents received by Sweetheart on July 19, 1983 was an invoice on which Detroit had described certain of its dishes as “Banana Boat Trays.” On the first day of trial Sweetheart moved to amend its complaint to include a count for trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1). Detroit opposed the motion as untimely. The district court denied the motion, stating: “I deny your motion, plaintiff’s motion, comes too late. If that’s all the proof you’ve got, you should have had it before then.”
Trial began on July 25, 1983. During cross-examination of one of Sweetheart’s witnesses, counsel for Detroit was permitted to inquire, over Sweetheart’s objection, as to Sweetheart’s knowledge of the use by Van Brode of a design alleged by Detroit to be similar to one of the designs in question. Also over Sweetheart’s objection, Detroit was permitted to publish deposition testimony of Stewart M. Graff, president of Douglas Stephens, and Norman Thrope, president of Formfit, which showed the use by both companies of dishes similar in design to the dishes manufactured by Sweetheart.
The district court then permitted counsel for Sweetheart, by way of cross-examination, to publish other portions of the same depositions which revealed acts taken by Sweetheart against the two companies. Specifically, the portion of the Thrope deposition published by Sweetheart showed that Sweetheart had notified Formfit that it was unhappy with Formfit’s shipping of boat-shaped dishes, and considered Formfit’s acts to be infringements on Sweetheart’s trademark rights. The portion of the Graff deposition published by Sweetheart showed that Sweetheart asked Douglas Stephens to cease manufacturing rowboat-shaped dishes and subsequently brought suit in New Jersey against Douglas Stephens for manufacturing the products.
Later in Sweetheart’s rebuttal case, the trial court permitted Sweetheart’s president to testify that Sweetheart had complained to Van Brode about the boat- shaped dish it produced, and that Van Brode thereafter stopped producing it. However, the trial judge prohibited Sweetheart from introducing in its rebuttal case evidence of the remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against Douglas Stephens and Formfit because there had been no formal adjudications in those actions.
Subsequently, the court instructed the jury to consider remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against the other manufacturers in determining whether Sweetheart acquiesced in the manufacture of similar dishes by others or abandoned its rights in the designs in question. These comments were reiterated when the district court, at the jury’s request, recharged the jury as to Detroit’s defenses.
II
The initial question to be decided is whether the district court erred in denying Sweetheart’s motion to amend its complaint. Detroit asserts Sweetheart could have included the count for trademark infringement in its complaint as originally filed, or moved to amend its complaint earlier because the words “Banana Boat” had previously appeared in certain documents which Detroit produced at the time it filed its answer and counterclaim. Detroit further contends it would have been unduly prejudiced if Sweetheart had been permitted to add a count for trademark infringement on the first day of trial.
Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that leave to amend a pleading “shall be freely given when justice so requires.” The United States Supreme Court has admonished that “this mandate is to be heeded.” Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). In Foman v. Davis, the Court stated further,
If the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits. In the absence of any apparent or declared reason — such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. — the leave sought should, as the rules require, be “freely given.” Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the District Court, but outright refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the Federal Rules.
Id. at 182, 83 S.Ct. at 230.
No apparent or declared reason for denial of the motion to amend exists in the instant case. Detroit’s assertion that Sweetheart should have included a count for trademark infringement in its complaint as originally filed is without merit. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as it existed at the time Sweetheart’s complaint was filed on January 28, 1983 provided in pertinent part:
Every pleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual name, whose address shall be stated ... The signature of an attorney constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay.
Clearly, Sweetheart’s counsel could not in good faith have included in his complaint a count for trademark infringement before he was aware of evidence to support such a claim. Such conduct would have violated both the letter and the spirit of Rule 11.
Detroit also asserts that Sweetheart could have moved to amend its complaint earlier because the mark “Banana Boat” appeared on certain documents submitted previously by Detroit. Detroit fails to cite to any evidence in the record which supports this contention. Our review of the record reveals only two documents, a blueprint drawing clearly designed for internal use by Detroit containing the words “Banana Boat Tray,” and a letter to the secretary of Detroit from a distributor in which the distributor referred to Detroit’s dishes as large and small “Banana Boat[s].” There was no evidence that this distributor ever used the term “Banana Boat” in the promotion or sale of Detroit’s dishes. Rather, the evidence shows that soon after receipt of the letter Detroit’s secretary admonished the distributor not to use the name “Banana Boat” with reference to Detroit’s products, and that this instruction was heeded. Certainly, Sweetheart’s knowledge of these documents was insufficient evidence upon which to base a claim for infringement of its trademark in connection with the sale and distribution of the dishes in interstate commerce. “Good ground” to support the claim under Rule 11 only came later, when Detroit produced an invoice containing the words “Banana Boat Trays” less than a week prior to trial.
Finally, the mere fact that the motion to amend was made the day of trial did not unduly prejudice Detroit so as to require denial of the motion. Absent prejudice to the opposing party, the mere fact that an amendment is offered late in the case is not enough to bar it. 3 J. Moore, Moore’s Federal Practice § 15.08[4] (2d ed. 1984); Howey v. United States, 481 F.2d 1187 (9th Cir.1973); Hanson v. Hunt Oil Company, 398 F.2d 578 (8th Cir.1968). The district court made no finding of prejudice to Detroit, concluding only that “plaintiff’s motion comes too late.”
Moreover, the record fails to show any basis for finding that the proffered amendment would have unduly prejudiced Detroit under the circumstances. Sweetheart’s original two counts for false designation of origin and unfair competition arise out of the sale and distribution by Detroit of plastic dishes having configurations which Sweetheart asserts are proprietary to it, including two boat-shaped dishes. The count for trademark infringement in connection with the sale and distribution of these dishes which Sweetheart sought to add by amendment is grounded on at least one of the same acts by Detroit that form the basis of the original two counts. Thus, Detroit has been aware since the filing of Sweetheart’s complaint of the circumstances from which the trademark infringement count arose. Moreover, Detroit was in possession of the document which forms the basis of Sweetheart’s motion to amend until six days before the motion was made, and thus cannot be heard to complain of unfair surprise by the inclusion of the additional count. Under these circumstances, Detroit would not have suffered undue prejudice from the amendment of the complaint immediately prior to trial. Since Sweetheart could not have brought a claim for trademark infringement earlier because Detroit did not produce the evidence of infringement until a few days before trial, and since Detroit would not have been unduly prejudiced by the amendment, the district court’s refusal to permit Sweetheart to amend its complaint was an abuse of discretion.
Ill
In addition, Sweetheart argues that the district court committed prejudicial error by refusing to admit evidence of remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against other manufacturers, and then instructing the jury to consider whether Sweetheart, by taking no action against the third party manufacturers, acquiesced in the manufacture of its dish designs by others or abandoned its rights. Sweetheart admits that it was permitted to read into the record part of the Thrope deposition which established that Sweetheart had notified Formfit that it considered the marketing of boat-shaped dishes by Formfit as an infringement of Sweetheart’s rights. However, Sweetheart asserts that all of its other efforts to introduce evidence of actions it took against the other manufacturers of boat-shaped dishes, Douglas Stephens and Van Brode, were “firmly and emphatically denied by the trial court.” This contention is utterly without support in the record. The record reveals the trial court also permitted Sweetheart to publish the part of the Graff deposition showing remedial acts Sweetheart had taken against Douglas Stephens, and to introduce rebuttal evidence of remedial acts taken by Sweetheart against Van Brode. Thus, even if the trial court erred in refusing to permit Sweetheart to admit in its rebuttal case evidence of the remedial acts it took against Douglas Stephens and Formfit, such error was harmless because the evidence had previously been published to the jury by Sweetheart. However, upon retrial the district court should allow Sweetheart full opportunity to prove all remedial actions taken against other manufacturers.
IV
We also reject Sweetheart’s argument that the trial court’s admission of Detroit’s evidence of the existence of other manufacturers of similarly designed dishes constituted prejudicial error. Evidence of the existence of manufacturers other than the defendant has certain relevance in this false designation of origin and unfair competition case. For example, with reference to a determination of whether Sweetheart had any proprietary rights in the unregistered designs of its dishes, evidence of the use of substantially identical designs by others was admissible as to the issue of whether secondary meaning attached to Sweetheart’s designs. Such evidence is probative of the extent and nature of exclusivity of use by Sweetheart. See Carter Wallace, Inc. v. Proctor & Gamble Co., 434 F.2d 794, 802 (9th Cir.1970); Universal City Studios v. Nintendo Co., 578 F.Supp. 911, 926 (S.D.N.Y.1983); Miller Brewing Co. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 503 F.Supp. 896 (D.C.Rhode Island 1980). Thus, the district court did not err in permitting the jury to consider evidence of the existence of third party manufacturers of substantially similar dishes.
V
Related to Sweetheart’s argument that the admission of Detroit’s evidence of other manufacturers was prejudicial is it’s contention that the trial court committed prejudicial error in instructing the jury to consider evidence of Sweetheart’s delay in enjoining the other manufacturers in determining whether Sweetheart acquiesced in the use of the dish designs by others or abandoned its rights in the dish designs.
With respect to Detroit’s defense of es-toppel by acquiescence the trial court instructed the jury in part:
The defendant, thus, alleges that the plaintiff has acquiesced in such manufacture, sales by the other manufacturers and should now be estopped from asserting its rights, if any it has, in the design or configuration of its relevant containers against anyone, including this defendant.
If you should find from the preponder-anee of the evidence that others were manufacturing and selling containers very similar to the relevant containers of the plaintiff for a long period of time, and that plaintiff was aware of such manufacture and sale, then you must decide whether by taking no action against other manufacturers the plaintiff tes, agreed or acquiesced that the others can manufacture its very similar products. If you so decide, then the plaintiff may not now assert its rights against the defendant.
As distinguished from laches, acquiescence constitutes a ground for denial of relief only upon a finding of conduct on the plaintiff’s part that amounted to an assurance to the defendant, express or implied, that the plaintiff would not assert his trademark rights against the defendant, Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Veb Carl Zeiss Jena, 433 F.2d 686, 704 (2nd Cir.1970), cert. denied 403 U.S. 905, 91 S.Ct. 2205, 29 L.Ed.2d 680 (1971); Exxon Corp. v. Humble Exploration Co., Inc., 524 F.Supp. 450, 467 (N.D.Tex.1981), aff'd in part, rev’d and remanded in part, 695 F.2d 96 (5th Cir.1983). Acquiescence may be inferred from the trademark owner’s affirmative conduct toward the defendant. For example, in Ambrosia Chocolate Co. v. Ambrosia Cake Bakery, 165 F.2d 693 (4th Cir.1947), cert. denied 333 U.S. 882, 68 S.Ct. 914, 92 L.Ed. 1157 (1948), not only was the plaintiff aware that the defendant was using the plaintiff’s registered trademark “Ambrosia” for eight years but also the plaintiff attempted to sell ingredients to the defendant to be used in making “Ambrosia” cakes to be marketed under that name. The court found this to be “active encouragement” by the plaintiff to induce the defendant to sell its cakes under the name “Ambrosia”, and injunctive relief was denied. Estoppel by acquiescence focuses on a plaintiffs acts toward the defendant, not toward other manufacturers, See, e.g., id. Although Sweetheart’s delay in enjoining Detroit may be relevant to the question of whether Sweetheart acquiesced in Detroit’s manufacture of the dishes in question, Sweetheart’s delay in prosecuting infringers other than Detroit has no rele-vanee to the defense of estoppel by acquiescence. While abandonment results in a loss of rights as against the whole world, laches or acquiescence is a personal defense which merely results in a loss of rights as against one defendant. 2 J.T. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 31:14 at 587 (2d ed. 1984). ThuS) assuming that Sweetheart estab-lighed it had proprietary rights in its unregistered dish designs, the fact that Sweetheart may have delayed in enjoining other manufacturers from using the dish designs would not amount to an assurance to Detroit that Sweetheart would not assert its trademark rights against Detroit. The trial court’s instruction that the jury should consider the acts of Sweetheart toward third party manufacturers of similar designs rather than the acts of Sweetheart toward Detroit in determining estoppel by acquiescence was therefore erroneous.
,. . ,. .. rffms. whether evide"ce of S7ethearts delfy “ ^mmg other manufacturers is relevant to a determma-tlon of the of abandonment. With resPect to the evidence of Sweetheart s de-la^ m enjoining other manufacturers, the court mstracted the jury on abandonment:
If y°u should find from the preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff knowingly permitted other manufacturers to use the designs without any control, then you would find that plaintiff had abandoned or lost such rights,
There has been little uniformity among the courts as to the impact of a plaintiff’s failure to sue other infringers on the defense of abandonment. The line of cases relied on by Sweetheart states that evidence of a plaintiff’s failure to sue other infringers is totally irrelevant in an unfair competition case because “it is no excuse for [a defendant] to say that others have been guilty of the same wrong.” National Lead Company v. Wolfe, 223 F.2d 195, 204 (9th Cir.1955); United States Jaycees v. San Francisco Jr. Chamber of Commerce, 354 F.Supp. 61, 73 (N.D.Cal.1972), aff'd 513 F.2d 1226 (9th Cir.1975) (and cases cited therein). Although this theory is appealing because no one should be exculpated from his own wrongful conduct merely because others are also guilty, the view “assumes that the case of infringement has already been proven and that failure to prosecute, and its possible impact on customer perception, is irrelevant to the issue of likelihood of confusion.” 1 J.T. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 17:5 at 778 (2d ed. 1984). As discussed previously, the evidence of Sweetheart’s delay or failure to enjoin other manufacturers is not totally irrelevant in this case where Sweetheart has the burden of proving secondary meaning.

The court erred in denying Sweetheart's motion to amend its complaint to include a count for trademark infringement. Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that leave to amend a pleading "shall be freely given when justice so requires." In Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962), the Supreme Court stated that "if the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits." The court's refusal to permit Sweetheart to amend its complaint was an abuse of discretion.

The court also erred in refusing to admit evidence of remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against other manufacturers. Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Co., 308 F.2d 403, 409 (5th Cir.1962), held that a trademark owner's failure to exercise control and supervision over the use of the mark by a licensee may estop the owner from challenging the use of the mark and business developed during the period of unsupervised use. Similarly, Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., 179 U.S. 19, 25 L.Ed. 769 (1900), held that a trademark owner's failure to take action against infringers may estop the owner from challenging the use of the mark.

The court's admission of Detroit's evidence of the existence of other manufacturers of similar designs was relevant to the issue of whether Sweetheart had any proprietary rights in the unregistered designs. Ambrosia Chocolate Co. v. Ambrosia Cake Bakery, 165 F.2d 693 (4th Cir.1947), cert. denied 333 U.S. 882, 68 S.Ct. 914, 92 L.Ed. 1157 (1948), held that a trademark owner's affirmative conduct toward a defendant may be evidence of acquiescence.

The court's instruction on abandonment was also error. United States Jaycees v. San Francisco Jr. Chamber of Commerce, 354 F.Supp. 61, 73 (N.D.Cal.1972), aff'd 513 F.2d 1226 (9th Cir.1975), held that evidence of a plaintiff's failure to

target_text: On the other hand, two of the cases relied on by Detroit, Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Company, 308 F.2d 403 (5th Cir.1962); Sheila’s Shine Products, Inc. v. Sheila Shine, Inc., 486 F.2d 114 (5th Cir.1973) are of no help in determining this issue. Those cases merely recognize the rule that a trademark owner’s uncontrolled or “naked” licensing of a mark may result in the trademark ceasing to function as a symbol of quality and controlled origin, which has been characterized as abandonment. This rule of uncontrolled licensing of a trademark is inapplicable to the instant case as no evidence of licensing has been presented. The other case relied on by Detroit, Saxlehner v. Eisener & Mendelson Co., 179 U.S. 19, 21 S.Ct. 7, 45 L.Ed. 60 (1900) does note the remedial actions taken by a trademark owner against other infringers in its discussion of abandonment; however, Saxlehner is factually distinguishable from the instant case because in Saxlehner the plaintiff’s mark “Hunyadi” was found to have become the generic name in this country for a type of water after others had used the name for twenty years without being sued by the plaintiff.

to buy the ticking, innerspring units and labels from sources specified by Spring-Air. In Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, supra, this was said: “For our purposes a tying agreement may be defined as an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on condition that the buyer also purchase a different (or tied) product, or at least agree that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier.” Here, there was no agreement by Spring-Air to sell any of the items involved, nor was there any condition requiring Denison to also purchase a different product from Spring-Air. Instead, the agreement specified sources other than Spring-Air from which Denison should purchase specified materials as a means whereby Spring-Air could control the nature and quality of its own product under its own trademark. The trademark would be of no worth unless the public could be sure that every mattress which bore that mark was uniform both in exterior design and interior quality. Denison must accept the judgment of Spring-Air on this requirement. The record shows that Denison could and did purchase from competitive suppliers all of the innerspring units it desired for use in its private brand products of which its annual volume ranged between one million and three million dollars. It is doubtful that every “tie-in” device is unlawful. Dehydrating Process Co. v. Smith, supra, 292 F.2d 653. We find nothing in the record which requires us to disagree with the findings and conclusions of the

but also a concurrent duty to exercise control and supervision over the licensee’s use of the mark. Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Co., 5 Cir. 1962, 308 F.2d 403, 409. Cf. Kidd v. Johnson, 1879, 100 U.S. 617, 25 L.Ed. 769. Failure to exercise such control and supervision for a significant period of time may estop the trademark owner from challenging the use of the mark and business which the licensee has developed during the period of such unsupervised use. Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Co., supra. This principle is an analogue to the es-toppel against a trademark owner who knowingly sits silently by while infring-ers use his trademark over a significant period of time. Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., 1900, 179 U.S. 19, 21 S. Ct. 7, 45 L.Ed. 60; Dwinell-Wright Co. v. White House Milk Co., 2 Cir. 1943, 132 F.2d 822. The undisputed failure by the MeCaffertys to exercise any supervision or control over the activities of Pan American or its successor SS Florida leads us to hold that SS California is estopped to challenge the business which SS Florida has built up under the mark Sheila Shine. As we develop, infra, however, this estoppel precludes challenge only in the trade area awarded to SS Florida. The lower court also found that the MeCaffertys abandoned any established business in Sheila Shine polish outside the states of California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Hawaii Shortly after the January, 1955 transaction. SS California correctly contends that mere

an actual intent to abandon. Acts which unexplained would .be sufficient to establish an abandonment may be answered by showing that there never was an intention to give up and relinquish the right claimed. Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Mfg. Co., 163 U. S. 169, 186; Moore v. Stevenson, 27 Conn. 13; Livermore v. White, 74 Maine, 452; Judson v. Malloy, 40 California, 299; Hickman v. Link, 116 Missouri, 123. And in a recent English case this doctrine has been applied to a case of trade-marks. Mouson v. Boehm, 26 Ch. Div. 398. With regard to the defence of abandonment, it may with confidence be said that there is but very slight evidence of any personal intention on the part of Andreas Saxlehner or his wife to abandon the use of the word “ Hunyadi or dedicate the same to the public, and none at all of an intent to abandon the peculiar bottles and labels in connection with which he sold his waters. In fact, Saxlehner’s whole life was a constant protest against the use by others of the name “ Hunyadi.” He discovered his spring in 1862, and in 1863 obtained permission to give it the name, of Hunyadi Spring. He carried on an uninterrupted trade under that name until 1872. It also appears from the certificate of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that the trade-mark “Hunyadi Janos” was, on December 12, 1872, registered, and that previously to such registration no trade-mark was entered in which the

This action concerns a series of four disposable plastic ice cream dishes which have been marketed by Sweetheart for the past twenty-five years. Two are rowboat-shaped dishes for banana splits, and two are bowl-shaped dishes for sundaes. Sweetheart does not have a registered trademark on the dish designs, but does own a registered trademark on the mark “Banana Boat.” Sweetheart alleged in its complaint that by virtue of its having sold billions of the dishes, and spent considerable sums Advertising and promoting them, the designs have come to identify its products as originating from a single source, Sweetheart.
During the 1960’s a company called Van Brode Milling Company (Van Brode) marketed a boat-shaped plastic ice cream dish. This practice was discontinued when Sweetheart asked Van Brode to stop. More recently, three other companies marketed lines of plastic disposable ice cream dishes which were substantially similar in design to Sweetheart’s line. These companies are Formfit Plastics, Inc. (Formfit), Douglas Stephens Plastics, Inc. (Douglas Stephens), and defendant Detroit. In addition to the instant litigation, Sweetheart has filed a companion case in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Douglas Stephens.
On July 19, 1983, six days before trial commenced, Sweetheart received certain documents it had requested from Detroit on January 28, 1983. Although the documents were ones in which Detroit had claimed that trade secrets were contained, a stipulated protective order had been entered by the court on June 9, 1983 which provided that confidential documents filed with the court would be sealed and segregated in the court’s files. One of the documents received by Sweetheart on July 19, 1983 was an invoice on which Detroit had described certain of its dishes as “Banana Boat Trays.” On the first day of trial Sweetheart moved to amend its complaint to include a count for trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1). Detroit opposed the motion as untimely. The district court denied the motion, stating: “I deny your motion, plaintiff’s motion, comes too late. If that’s all the proof you’ve got, you should have had it before then.”
Trial began on July 25, 1983. During cross-examination of one of Sweetheart’s witnesses, counsel for Detroit was permitted to inquire, over Sweetheart’s objection, as to Sweetheart’s knowledge of the use by Van Brode of a design alleged by Detroit to be similar to one of the designs in question. Also over Sweetheart’s objection, Detroit was permitted to publish deposition testimony of Stewart M. Graff, president of Douglas Stephens, and Norman Thrope, president of Formfit, which showed the use by both companies of dishes similar in design to the dishes manufactured by Sweetheart.
The district court then permitted counsel for Sweetheart, by way of cross-examination, to publish other portions of the same depositions which revealed acts taken by Sweetheart against the two companies. Specifically, the portion of the Thrope deposition published by Sweetheart showed that Sweetheart had notified Formfit that it was unhappy with Formfit’s shipping of boat-shaped dishes, and considered Formfit’s acts to be infringements on Sweetheart’s trademark rights. The portion of the Graff deposition published by Sweetheart showed that Sweetheart asked Douglas Stephens to cease manufacturing rowboat-shaped dishes and subsequently brought suit in New Jersey against Douglas Stephens for manufacturing the products.
Later in Sweetheart’s rebuttal case, the trial court permitted Sweetheart’s president to testify that Sweetheart had complained to Van Brode about the boat- shaped dish it produced, and that Van Brode thereafter stopped producing it. However, the trial judge prohibited Sweetheart from introducing in its rebuttal case evidence of the remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against Douglas Stephens and Formfit because there had been no formal adjudications in those actions.
Subsequently, the court instructed the jury to consider remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against the other manufacturers in determining whether Sweetheart acquiesced in the manufacture of similar dishes by others or abandoned its rights in the designs in question. These comments were reiterated when the district court, at the jury’s request, recharged the jury as to Detroit’s defenses.
II
The initial question to be decided is whether the district court erred in denying Sweetheart’s motion to amend its complaint. Detroit asserts Sweetheart could have included the count for trademark infringement in its complaint as originally filed, or moved to amend its complaint earlier because the words “Banana Boat” had previously appeared in certain documents which Detroit produced at the time it filed its answer and counterclaim. Detroit further contends it would have been unduly prejudiced if Sweetheart had been permitted to add a count for trademark infringement on the first day of trial.
Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that leave to amend a pleading “shall be freely given when justice so requires.” The United States Supreme Court has admonished that “this mandate is to be heeded.” Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). In Foman v. Davis, the Court stated further,
If the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits. In the absence of any apparent or declared reason — such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. — the leave sought should, as the rules require, be “freely given.” Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the District Court, but outright refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the Federal Rules.
Id. at 182, 83 S.Ct. at 230.
No apparent or declared reason for denial of the motion to amend exists in the instant case. Detroit’s assertion that Sweetheart should have included a count for trademark infringement in its complaint as originally filed is without merit. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as it existed at the time Sweetheart’s complaint was filed on January 28, 1983 provided in pertinent part:
Every pleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual name, whose address shall be stated ... The signature of an attorney constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay.
Clearly, Sweetheart’s counsel could not in good faith have included in his complaint a count for trademark infringement before he was aware of evidence to support such a claim. Such conduct would have violated both the letter and the spirit of Rule 11.
Detroit also asserts that Sweetheart could have moved to amend its complaint earlier because the mark “Banana Boat” appeared on certain documents submitted previously by Detroit. Detroit fails to cite to any evidence in the record which supports this contention. Our review of the record reveals only two documents, a blueprint drawing clearly designed for internal use by Detroit containing the words “Banana Boat Tray,” and a letter to the secretary of Detroit from a distributor in which the distributor referred to Detroit’s dishes as large and small “Banana Boat[s].” There was no evidence that this distributor ever used the term “Banana Boat” in the promotion or sale of Detroit’s dishes. Rather, the evidence shows that soon after receipt of the letter Detroit’s secretary admonished the distributor not to use the name “Banana Boat” with reference to Detroit’s products, and that this instruction was heeded. Certainly, Sweetheart’s knowledge of these documents was insufficient evidence upon which to base a claim for infringement of its trademark in connection with the sale and distribution of the dishes in interstate commerce. “Good ground” to support the claim under Rule 11 only came later, when Detroit produced an invoice containing the words “Banana Boat Trays” less than a week prior to trial.
Finally, the mere fact that the motion to amend was made the day of trial did not unduly prejudice Detroit so as to require denial of the motion. Absent prejudice to the opposing party, the mere fact that an amendment is offered late in the case is not enough to bar it. 3 J. Moore, Moore’s Federal Practice § 15.08[4] (2d ed. 1984); Howey v. United States, 481 F.2d 1187 (9th Cir.1973); Hanson v. Hunt Oil Company, 398 F.2d 578 (8th Cir.1968). The district court made no finding of prejudice to Detroit, concluding only that “plaintiff’s motion comes too late.”
Moreover, the record fails to show any basis for finding that the proffered amendment would have unduly prejudiced Detroit under the circumstances. Sweetheart’s original two counts for false designation of origin and unfair competition arise out of the sale and distribution by Detroit of plastic dishes having configurations which Sweetheart asserts are proprietary to it, including two boat-shaped dishes. The count for trademark infringement in connection with the sale and distribution of these dishes which Sweetheart sought to add by amendment is grounded on at least one of the same acts by Detroit that form the basis of the original two counts. Thus, Detroit has been aware since the filing of Sweetheart’s complaint of the circumstances from which the trademark infringement count arose. Moreover, Detroit was in possession of the document which forms the basis of Sweetheart’s motion to amend until six days before the motion was made, and thus cannot be heard to complain of unfair surprise by the inclusion of the additional count. Under these circumstances, Detroit would not have suffered undue prejudice from the amendment of the complaint immediately prior to trial. Since Sweetheart could not have brought a claim for trademark infringement earlier because Detroit did not produce the evidence of infringement until a few days before trial, and since Detroit would not have been unduly prejudiced by the amendment, the district court’s refusal to permit Sweetheart to amend its complaint was an abuse of discretion.
Ill
In addition, Sweetheart argues that the district court committed prejudicial error by refusing to admit evidence of remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against other manufacturers, and then instructing the jury to consider whether Sweetheart, by taking no action against the third party manufacturers, acquiesced in the manufacture of its dish designs by others or abandoned its rights. Sweetheart admits that it was permitted to read into the record part of the Thrope deposition which established that Sweetheart had notified Formfit that it considered the marketing of boat-shaped dishes by Formfit as an infringement of Sweetheart’s rights. However, Sweetheart asserts that all of its other efforts to introduce evidence of actions it took against the other manufacturers of boat-shaped dishes, Douglas Stephens and Van Brode, were “firmly and emphatically denied by the trial court.” This contention is utterly without support in the record. The record reveals the trial court also permitted Sweetheart to publish the part of the Graff deposition showing remedial acts Sweetheart had taken against Douglas Stephens, and to introduce rebuttal evidence of remedial acts taken by Sweetheart against Van Brode. Thus, even if the trial court erred in refusing to permit Sweetheart to admit in its rebuttal case evidence of the remedial acts it took against Douglas Stephens and Formfit, such error was harmless because the evidence had previously been published to the jury by Sweetheart. However, upon retrial the district court should allow Sweetheart full opportunity to prove all remedial actions taken against other manufacturers.
IV
We also reject Sweetheart’s argument that the trial court’s admission of Detroit’s evidence of the existence of other manufacturers of similarly designed dishes constituted prejudicial error. Evidence of the existence of manufacturers other than the defendant has certain relevance in this false designation of origin and unfair competition case. For example, with reference to a determination of whether Sweetheart had any proprietary rights in the unregistered designs of its dishes, evidence of the use of substantially identical designs by others was admissible as to the issue of whether secondary meaning attached to Sweetheart’s designs. Such evidence is probative of the extent and nature of exclusivity of use by Sweetheart. See Carter Wallace, Inc. v. Proctor & Gamble Co., 434 F.2d 794, 802 (9th Cir.1970); Universal City Studios v. Nintendo Co., 578 F.Supp. 911, 926 (S.D.N.Y.1983); Miller Brewing Co. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 503 F.Supp. 896 (D.C.Rhode Island 1980). Thus, the district court did not err in permitting the jury to consider evidence of the existence of third party manufacturers of substantially similar dishes.
V
Related to Sweetheart’s argument that the admission of Detroit’s evidence of other manufacturers was prejudicial is it’s contention that the trial court committed prejudicial error in instructing the jury to consider evidence of Sweetheart’s delay in enjoining the other manufacturers in determining whether Sweetheart acquiesced in the use of the dish designs by others or abandoned its rights in the dish designs.
With respect to Detroit’s defense of es-toppel by acquiescence the trial court instructed the jury in part:
The defendant, thus, alleges that the plaintiff has acquiesced in such manufacture, sales by the other manufacturers and should now be estopped from asserting its rights, if any it has, in the design or configuration of its relevant containers against anyone, including this defendant.
If you should find from the preponder-anee of the evidence that others were manufacturing and selling containers very similar to the relevant containers of the plaintiff for a long period of time, and that plaintiff was aware of such manufacture and sale, then you must decide whether by taking no action against other manufacturers the plaintiff tes, agreed or acquiesced that the others can manufacture its very similar products. If you so decide, then the plaintiff may not now assert its rights against the defendant.
As distinguished from laches, acquiescence constitutes a ground for denial of relief only upon a finding of conduct on the plaintiff’s part that amounted to an assurance to the defendant, express or implied, that the plaintiff would not assert his trademark rights against the defendant, Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Veb Carl Zeiss Jena, 433 F.2d 686, 704 (2nd Cir.1970), cert. denied 403 U.S. 905, 91 S.Ct. 2205, 29 L.Ed.2d 680 (1971); Exxon Corp. v. Humble Exploration Co., Inc., 524 F.Supp. 450, 467 (N.D.Tex.1981), aff'd in part, rev’d and remanded in part, 695 F.2d 96 (5th Cir.1983). Acquiescence may be inferred from the trademark owner’s affirmative conduct toward the defendant. For example, in Ambrosia Chocolate Co. v. Ambrosia Cake Bakery, 165 F.2d 693 (4th Cir.1947), cert. denied 333 U.S. 882, 68 S.Ct. 914, 92 L.Ed. 1157 (1948), not only was the plaintiff aware that the defendant was using the plaintiff’s registered trademark “Ambrosia” for eight years but also the plaintiff attempted to sell ingredients to the defendant to be used in making “Ambrosia” cakes to be marketed under that name. The court found this to be “active encouragement” by the plaintiff to induce the defendant to sell its cakes under the name “Ambrosia”, and injunctive relief was denied. Estoppel by acquiescence focuses on a plaintiffs acts toward the defendant, not toward other manufacturers, See, e.g., id. Although Sweetheart’s delay in enjoining Detroit may be relevant to the question of whether Sweetheart acquiesced in Detroit’s manufacture of the dishes in question, Sweetheart’s delay in prosecuting infringers other than Detroit has no rele-vanee to the defense of estoppel by acquiescence. While abandonment results in a loss of rights as against the whole world, laches or acquiescence is a personal defense which merely results in a loss of rights as against one defendant. 2 J.T. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 31:14 at 587 (2d ed. 1984). ThuS) assuming that Sweetheart estab-lighed it had proprietary rights in its unregistered dish designs, the fact that Sweetheart may have delayed in enjoining other manufacturers from using the dish designs would not amount to an assurance to Detroit that Sweetheart would not assert its trademark rights against Detroit. The trial court’s instruction that the jury should consider the acts of Sweetheart toward third party manufacturers of similar designs rather than the acts of Sweetheart toward Detroit in determining estoppel by acquiescence was therefore erroneous.
,. . ,. .. rffms. whether evide"ce of S7ethearts delfy “ ^mmg other manufacturers is relevant to a determma-tlon of the of abandonment. With resPect to the evidence of Sweetheart s de-la^ m enjoining other manufacturers, the court mstracted the jury on abandonment:
If y°u should find from the preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff knowingly permitted other manufacturers to use the designs without any control, then you would find that plaintiff had abandoned or lost such rights,
There has been little uniformity among the courts as to the impact of a plaintiff’s failure to sue other infringers on the defense of abandonment. The line of cases relied on by Sweetheart states that evidence of a plaintiff’s failure to sue other infringers is totally irrelevant in an unfair competition case because “it is no excuse for [a defendant] to say that others have been guilty of the same wrong.” National Lead Company v. Wolfe, 223 F.2d 195, 204 (9th Cir.1955); United States Jaycees v. San Francisco Jr. Chamber of Commerce, 354 F.Supp. 61, 73 (N.D.Cal.1972), aff'd 513 F.2d 1226 (9th Cir.1975) (and cases cited therein). Although this theory is appealing because no one should be exculpated from his own wrongful conduct merely because others are also guilty, the view “assumes that the case of infringement has already been proven and that failure to prosecute, and its possible impact on customer perception, is irrelevant to the issue of likelihood of confusion.” 1 J.T. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 17:5 at 778 (2d ed. 1984). As discussed previously, the evidence of Sweetheart’s delay or failure to enjoin other manufacturers is not totally irrelevant in this case where Sweetheart has the burden of proving secondary meaning.

Section 455(a) of 28 U.S.C. mandates that any justice, judge, or magistrate must disqualify themselves in any proceeding where their impartiality may reasonably be questioned. Similar principles were applied in the case referenced as 261 F.3d 1075, where motions for recusal were denied based on the argument of perceived partiality due to earlier rulings and a law clerk’s previous employment at a related law firm. This case emphasizes that impartiality must be assessed based on reasonableness and factual basis.

Moreover, the Supreme Court in 384 U.S. 563 reaffirmed the essential principle that bias and prejudice necessitating recusal must stem from an extrajudicial source, not from a judge's participation in the case or their judicial conduct therein. In my questioning of Ms. Gwynn's compliance with the Local Rules, there was no external influence or bias; rather, the actions were within judicial discretion to ensure adherence to procedural norms.

Given these precedents, none of Ms. Gwynn’s allegations meet the statutory or jurisprudential threshold for recusal under 28 U.S.C. § 455. The mere fact that judicial decisions were adverse to her or included rigorous procedural enforcement does not establish bias or partiality warranting disqualification.

target_text: As noted above, recusal under § 455(a) is required “in any proceeding in which [a judge’s] impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” thus requiring re-cusal where the judge has acted in such a way as to give the appearance of partiality to a reasonable person. A judge’s rulings and expressions of opinion generally fail to justify recusal. As the Eleventh Circuit has put it, “adverse rulings alone do not provide a party with a basis for holding that the court’s impartiality is in doubt.” Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1075, 1103 (11th Cir.2001). Of course judges hold and express opinions about the litigants and issues that they have formed during court proceedings. But as the Supreme Court succinctly stated in United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966): “The alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source ... other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.”

the court’s dismissal of all of her claims, except her medical malpractice count, against the Nezhats and the Center, and (4) the court’s imposition of monetary sanctions. Byrne appeals the district court’s imposition of monetary sanctions as well. We consider first Manov’s argument that the district court should have recused. II. Section 455(a) of the United States Code states: “Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” On July 8, 1996, one month after the court ordered Rule 11 discovery, Manov moved the district court to recuse pursuant to this statute. The court denied the motion the next day, following a hearing on various matters. Manov renewed the motion on April 23, 1998, two months after the court entered the first sanctions order. The court denied this motion as well. Both of Manov’s motions for recusal were based on the notion that the district court created an appearance of impartiality by having in its chambers a law clerk, McDevitt, who had been employed by one of the law firms representing the Nezhats and the Center in this case and in Mullen’s state court case. Manov’s second motion added another basis for recusal— the court’s rulings against Manov demonstrated that the court’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Due to this additional alleged ground for recusal, we address the motions separately. Our standard of review is whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied Manov’s

To that the court replied: “I can’t understand frankly why you don’t realize that you have forced me to look at the documents in this case, which I dislike doing in advance of trial. You have invited me, therefore, into what I regard as, from your point of view, a rather undesirable situation. I think I made that clear at the beginning. I have told you that, forced by you to look, my views are more extreme than those of the government; and I have also made you realize that if I am required to make Findings and reach Conclusions I am opening up third-party suits that will make, in view of the size of the industry, the percentage of people involved higher than in the electrical cases.” Shortly thereafter defendants filed a motion for the disqualification of Judge Wyzanski on the grounds of personal bias and prejudice. The alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case. Berger v. United States, 255 U. S. 22, 31. Any adverse attitudes that Judge Wyzanski evinced toward the defendants were based on his study of the depositions and briefs which the parties had requested him to make. What he

previous_text: ORDER DENYING MARY ALICE GWYNN’S MOTION TO RECUSE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE
JOHN K. OLSON, Bankruptcy Judge.
THIS CASE is before me on the Verified Motion for Recusal of the Honorable John K. Olson Pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 5004, 28 U.S.C. § 144 and § 144 (the “Recusal Motion”) [DE 299] filed November 30, 2007, by Mary Alice Gwynn (“Ms. Gwynn”), purportedly as a creditor of these chapter 7 debtors, and on Mary Alice Gwynn’s Response to the Court’s Order on Ms. Gwynn’s Purported Compliance with Practice Requirements and Supplement to Mary Alice Gwynn’s Motion for Recusal [DE 311], filed December 11, 2007 (the “Supplemental Motion,” and together with the Recusal Motion, the “Recusal Motions”).
I conducted a hearing on the Recusal Motions on December 17, 2007, and denied them on the record. An excerpted transcript of the relevant portion of that hearing was filed on May 7, 2008, as Docket Entry 322. This Order memorializes my reasons for denying the Recusal Motions.
I. Background
I inherited this case pursuant to Chief Judge Hyman’s Order Transferring Case [DE 278] entered October 30, 2007. That Order was entered after Ms. Gwynn filed her Emergency Motion to Disqualify and Request to Stay Proceedings (the “Emergency Motion”) [DE 276], filed October 29, 2007. In the Order Transferring Case, Judge Hyman correctly ruled that no basis for his disqualification had been stated but that judicial efficiency suggested that it was appropriate to transfer this case to me because a related corporate case, In re It’s All in the Style, Inc., Case No. 05-30362, had been transferred to me in August 2007.
In the Emergency Motion, Ms. Gwynn sought two distinct forms of relief. First, she sought entry of an order disqualifying Chief Judge Hyman from further presiding in this case and to transfer the case to me. Second, she sought a stay of all proceedings in this case pending determination of an appeal now pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. I conducted a hearing on the Emergency Motion on November 7, 2007, and entered an Order denying the relief sought on November 9, 2007 [DE 285], published as In re Hussey, 378 B.R. 397 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.2007). I denied the Emergency Motion as moot to the extent that it sought Judge Hyman’s disqualification and denied the balance of the Emergency Motion on the merits.
The matters giving rise to the Recusal Motions all occurred at the hearing on the Emergency Motion on November 7, 2007, and chiefly arise out of colloquy between Ms. Gwynn and me at that hearing relating to her non-compliance with the Local Rules of this Court. A transcript of that hearing is found at Docket Entry 289 and portions of it are contained in the Recusal Motion.
As I ruled in the Order denying the Emergency Motion, Ms. Gwynn’s pleadings in this case which were then before me did not bear either of the alternative certifications required under this Court’s then-applicable Local Rule 9011-4, which provided in relevant part as follows:
(A) Identification of Attorney. In the signature block of all court papers signed by an attorney, the attorney must be identified by name, state bar number, complete mailing address, telephone number and the name of the party who [sic] the attorney represents.
(B) Certification of Attorney. Papers filed by an attorney appearing:
(1) as a qualified attorney pursuant to Local Rule 2090-l(A) must contain this certification: “I hereby certify that I am admitted to the Bar of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and am in compliance with the additional qualifications to practice in this court set forth in Local Rule 2090-KA).”....
(2) pro hac vice pursuant to Local Rule 2090-l(B)(2) must contain this certification: “I hereby certify that the undersigned attorney is appearing pro hac vice in this matter pursuant to court order dated (date).” This certification shall be placed in papers in the locations described in subdivision (1) above.
In turn, Local Rule 2090-1 provides in relevant part:
Rule 2090-1. Attorneys.
(A) Qualifications to Practice. Except as provided in subdivision (B) of this rule, to be qualified to practice in this court an attorney must:
(1) be a member of the Bar of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida under the Special Rules Governing the Admission and Practice of Attorneys in the District Court;
(2) read and remain familiar with these rules, administrative orders, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, The Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct, and the Bankruptcy Code; and
(3) earn at least 12 credit hours from The Florida Bar for attending or participating in CLE courses related to the subject area of “Bankruptcy Law” during each attorney’s Florida Bar three-year CLE reporting requirement. This provision will not preclude an attorney from appearing who is within a three-year CLE reporting period but who has not yet earned the required 12 hours for that period.
Attorneys appearing pursuant to this subdivision must include on all papers the certification contained in Local Rule 9011-4CB).
(B) Appearances Permitted as Exceptions to Qualification Requirements.
An attorney who has not fulfilled the qualifications to practice set forth in subdivision (A) above may only appear as set forth in this subdivision. Any attorney who appears pursuant to this rule shall be deemed to be familiar with, and shall be governed by, these rules, and the Rules of Professional Conduct and other ethical limitations or requirements governing the professional behavior of members of The Florida Bar.
(1) Appearances in Limited Instances. [Inapplicable here].
(2) Pro Hac Vice Appearances. Any attorney who is a member in good standing of the bar of any state or territory or insular possession of the United States, but is not admitted to practice in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and qualified to practice before this court may, upon the filing and this court’s approval of the Local Form “Motion to Appear Pro Hac Vice” and proposed Local Form “Order Admitted Attorney Pro Hac Vice”, be permitted to appear and participate in a particular case or proceeding. The motion shall designate an attorney who is qualified to practice in this court and who maintains an office in this district for the practice of law with whom the court and opposing counsel may readily communicate regarding the conduct of the case or proceeding and upon whom papers shall be served. The motion must be accompanied by a written statement of the local attorney who consented to the designation, and the name, address and tele phone number of the named des-ignee. The motion shall (a) indicate all bars or courts to which the attorney is admitted; (b) indicate all bars or courts, if any, from which the visiting attorney has been disbarred, suspended or prohibited from appearing in front of and the dates of the foregoing; and (e) certify that the visiting attorney is familiar with and shall be governed by these rules, the Rules of Professional Conduct and all other requirements governing the professional behavior of members of The Florida Bar. Visiting attorneys appearing under this subdivision shall include on all papers filed with the court the certification contained in Local Rule 9011-4(B)(2). Upon written motion and for good cause shown, the court may waive or modify the requirements of designation of qualified local counsel.
In light of these requirements contained in the Local Rules, it was surprising to me that the Emergency Motion contained neither of the alternative certifications mandated by Local Rule 9011-4(A) or Local Rule 9011-4(B)(2). When I raised the absence of either certification with Ms. Gwynn, she asserted — falsely—that she was representing herself and appearing before me pro se. As noted in footnote 1 above, Ms. Gwynn individually is not a creditor of these Debtors. Proof of Claim 18-1 was filed by Gwynn, P.A., and both the proof of claim form and the underlying contract on which it is based so indicate.
Local Rule 9010 — 1(B)(1) prohibits corporations from appearing in proceedings in this Court except in limited circumstances. The Rule provides:
(1) Corporations and Other Business Entities. A corporation, partnership, trust, or other business entity cannot appear or act on its own behalf without counsel in a case or proceeding, except to file a request for service of notices (pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2002), a proof of claim, a response to an objection to its claim, or a ballot, or to attend and inquire at the meeting of creditors held under 11 U.S.C. § 341.
It is clear that the Emergency Motion did not fall within any of the exceptions to Local Rule 9010 — 1(B)(1). Thus, under the Local Rules, Gwynn, P.A. could only appear by an attorney authorized to practice in this Court under Local Rule 2090-1.
Local Rule 9010 — 1(B)(1) is completely consistent with the very long-standing rule that corporations and other artificial entities can act only through their agents, cannot appear pro se, and must be represented by counsel. Commercial & Railroad Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb, 39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 60, 10 L.Ed. 354 (1840); Osborn v. Bank of United States, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738, 6 L.Ed. 204 (1824); Palazzo v. Gulf Oil Corporation, 764 F.2d 1381, 1385-86 (11th Cir.1985); In re K.M.A., Inc., 652 F.2d 398 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981); In re Las Colinas Development Corp., 585 F.2d 7 (1st Cir.1978). There is simply no question that a corporation cannot be represented by someone who is not an authorized attorney, even if that person is the president and sole shareholder of the corporation. Palazzo, supra; Las Colinas, supra.
The question here is whether Ms. Gwynn, despite her failure to certify to her qualification to practice in this Court, is an attorney who could represent Gwynn, P.A., in this case.
I took at face value Ms. Gwynn’s statement to me at the hearing on November 7, 2007, that my questioning her ability to act in this case took her by surprise. It was for that reason that I allowed her to proceed with argument on the substance of the Motion; I did not want to prejudice any substantive rights because of a procedural failure. It was nonetheless necessary to deal with the question as to whether Ms. Gwynn could represent Gwynn, P.A. going forward.
I concluded that Ms. Gwynn could not then represent Gwynn, P.A. in this case. In a very detailed order [DE 1553] entered on June 7, 2006, in another case in this District, In re Walker, Case No. 03-32158-BKC-PGH, Chief Judge Hyman prohibited Gwynn from acting as an attorney in any case in this Court until she establishes the minimal qualifications to do so which are required by this Court’s Local Rules. Specifically, the decretal paragraphs of that Order [DE 1553] provides:
The Court, having reviewed the Response, the Sworn Certification, the docket in this case, having observed Gwynn’s conduct in this Court during the past three years, and being otherwise fully advised in the premises, hereby:
ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that Gwynn shall be prohibited from representing any parties before the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida until she earns 12 credit hours from the Florida Bar for attending or participating in CLE courses related to the subject area of “Bankruptcy Law” which shall mean courses directly related to Title 11 of the United States Code and the Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure.
At the November 7, 2007, hearing on the Emergency Motion, I asked Ms. Gwynn if she had taken any CLE courses in the area of bankruptcy law. She informed me that she had taken five hours of such courses. Manifestly, therefore, she had failed as of that date to comply with the condition precedent imposed by In re Walker that she obtain 12 CLE credit hours from The Florida Bar before she may represent any party in this Court. Thus, not only had Ms. Gwynn failed to comply with the requirements of Local Rules 2090-1 and 9011-4, but she had also failed to comply with the requirements of a valid Order of this Court which had not (and has not) been stayed or reversed on appeal. She has also acknowledged by her own representation made to me at the hearing on the Emergency Motion that she did not then satisfy the minimal practice requirements set forth in Local Rule 2090-1(A)(3). I therefore concluded that Ms. Gwynn could not represent Gwynn, P.A. until and unless she is in full compliance with the Local Rules and with the mandate of Chief Judge Hyman in In re Walker. See [DE 1553] in Walker. Given what Chief Judge Hyman found in Walker was her gross unfamiliarity “with the Court’s Local Rules, administrative orders, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, The Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct, and the Bankruptcy Code,” I prohibited Ms. Gwynn from filing any pleading or representing any party in any case in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida (other than appearances expressly permitted under Local Rule 2090 — 1(B)(1) “Appearances in Limited Instances”) until such time as she provided to me a certified record from The Florida Bar which establishes that she has completed at least 12 hours of Florida Bar approved CLE courses in the area of Bankruptcy Law.
The Recusal Motions assert that my questioning of Ms. Gwynn at the hearing on the Emergency Motion was “not only demeaning, but show a pre-disposition and/or pre-determination against her, indicating the Court cannot be fair and impartial in its rulings.” The Recusal Motions also contend that I have been selective in enforcing the Local Rules “in a discriminating fashion.”
Much of the Recusal Motion is devoted to complaints about proceedings in other courts involving the lawyers who represent the chapter 7 Trustee in this case, Deborah Menotte. Some background is in order. The Walker case referred to above has been a protracted slug-fest involving, among others, Ms. Gwynn and Gary J. Rotella, a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer who represents Trustee Menotte in this case. It is sufficient for purposes of the matters now before me to note that the animosity between Ms. Gwynn and Mr. Rotella (and his firm) is nonpareil. That animosity has overflowed into every matter in contention between these parties, and may help explain the bitterness of the pleadings and the umbrage which Ms. Gwynn took to my questioning her qualifications.
As part of the Order [DE 285] denying the Emergency Motion [DE 276], I prohibited Ms. Gwynn from filing any pleadings in this Court until she was in compliance with the Local Rules. The hearing on the Emergency Motion was held November 7, 2007, and the Order denying the Emergency Motion was entered November 9th. On November 19th, Ms. Gwynn filed a Notice of Compliance [DE 295], asserting that she was in full compliance with the Local Rules. On November 30th, Ms. Gwynn filed the Recusal Motion. On December 4, 2007, I entered an Order on Gwynn’s Purported Compliance with Practice Requirements [DE 302]. The entire text of that Order recites as follows:
This case is before me without a hearing on Mary Alice Gwynn’s Notice of Compliance (the “Notice”) [DE 295] purporting to establish that she is in compliance with the provisions of the Order [DE 285] entered in this case on November 7, 2007, which (among other things) prohibited her from acting on behalf of a corporation in this case because she is not qualified to practice in this Court. The Notice was filed on November 19, 2007.
Ms. Gwynn has now filed a verified motion (the “Motion to Disqualify”) [DE 299] seeking to disqualify me from acting further in this case. The Motion to Disqualify has been set for hearing in the ordinary course on December 17, 2007. In light of the allegations contained in the Motion to Disqualify, which assert that my impartiality might reasonably be questioned, it would be inappropriate for me to consider the Notice or to act in respect of any matters in this case until such time as I have ruled on the Motion to Disqualify. In the event that I grant the Motion to Disqualify, the Notice should of course be considered by a successor judge in this case. In the event that I deny the Motion to Disqualify, the Notice will be considered in due course.
Ms. Gwynn filed the Supplemental Motion on December 11, 2007. In it, she contends that I had “had adequate time to respond to Ms. Gwynn’s Notice prior to the filing of her Motion for Recusal,” and that “for the Court to withhold any ruling for sixteen (16) days, when the Court is well aware that not allowing Creditor, Gwynn, access to file critical, timely pleadings, could have grave impact not only on her practice, but on her personally, and is extremely prejudicial in and of itself.” The Supplemental Motion contends “[f]or the Court to delay reinstatement for any reason, and to deny Gwynn’s access to the Court to file, in violation of her constitutional rights, is further evidence of prejudgment or bias on the part of this Court, which warrants recusal.” Finally, the Supplemental Motion contends (without any citation to evidence) that I am “now working in conjunction with Judge Hyman to ruin her reputation and career, both personally and professionally.”
II. Discussion
The Recusal Motions contend that I should recuse myself from further consideration of this case pursuant to the provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 5004, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 144 and 455. 28 U.S.C. § 144 is clearly inapplicable. It provides as follows:
Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding.
The affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed not less than ten days before the beginning of the term at which the proceeding is to be heard, or good cause shall be shown for failure to file it within such time. A party may file only one such affidavit in any case, It shall be accompanied by a certificate of counsel of record stating that it is made in good faith.
Section 144 is applicable only to proceedings “in a district court,” and has no application to proceedings before a bankruptcy judge. Dubnoff v. Goldstein, 385 F.2d 717, 720 (2nd Cir.1967); Ginger v. Cohn, 255 F.2d 99 (6th Cir.1958); Seidel v. Durkin (In re Goodwin), 194 B.R. 214, 221 (9th Cir. BAP 1996).
By its express terms, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 5004 makes clear that the disqualification of a bankruptcy judge is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 455. Section 455(a) speaks in general terms and requires the recusal of a federal judge, including s bankruptcy judge, “in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” thus requiring recusal not only where the judge has actual bias but also where he or she has acted in such a way as to give the appearance of partiality to a reasonable person. SCA Services, Inc. v. Morgan, 557 F.2d 110, 113-14 (7th Cir.1977). The appearance of impartiality is virtually as important as the fact of impartiality. Webbe v. McGhie Land Title Co., 549 F.2d 1358, 1361 (10th Cir.1977). It is of no consequence that the judge is not actually biased, inasmuch as § 455 concerns not only fairness to individual litigants but also the public’s confidence in the judiciary, which could be irreparably harmed if a case were allowed to proceed before a judge who appears to be tainted. In re Kensington Intern., Ltd., 353 F.3d 211 (3rd Cir.2003); on remand 305 B.R. 175 (D.Del.2004); opinion after remand 368 F.3d 289 (3rd Cir.2004).
In addition to the general requirement of impartiality contained in § 455(a), § 455(b) requires recusal in specific situations, including where the judge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts; where the judge personally or through former law partners or associates was involved in the case or has been a material witness concerning it; where the judge or a close relative is involved in the case; or where the judge, his spouse, or a minor child residing in his household has either a financial interest in the outcome or any other interest which could be substantially affected by the outcome of the case.
Although none of the specific grounds for disqualification specified in § 455(b) apply here, I think it useful to comment on this last provision, that dealing with “financial interest.” A judge is required by § 455(c) to “inform himself about his personal and fiduciary financial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself about the personal financial interests of his spouse and minor children living in his household.” A judge is thus required to recuse him-or herself whenever the judge, his or her spouse, or a minor child living at home owns a single share of stock in a litigant. Union Carbide Corp. v. U.S. Cutting Service, Inc., 782 F.2d 710 (7th Cir.1986). This requirement may seem extreme, but its fundamental wisdom is perhaps best expressed in the following poem by Benjamin Franklin, writing decades before the American Revolution in Poor Richard’s Almanack:
The Complaint
A Farmer once made a complaint to a Judge,
My Bull, if it please you, Sir, owing a Grudge,
Belike to one of your good Worship’s Cattle,
Has slain him out-right in a mortal Battle:
I’m sorry at heart because of the Action, And want to know how must be made Satisfaction.
Why, you must give me your Bull, that’s plain
Says the Judge, or pay me the Price of the Slain.
But I have mistaken the Case, Sir, says John,
The dead Bull I talk of, and please you, ‘s my own:
And yours is the Beast that the Mischief has done.
The Judge soon replies with a serious Face:
Say you so? Then this Accident alters the case.
Section 455 is designed to assure that no federal judge is ever put in a position where his or her financial interests, however minimal, could be cited as having influenced the results of litigation.

In the context of the legal case, I would argue that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to recuse. The court's decision was based on the judge's impartiality and lack of personal bias, which is a requirement under 28 U.S.C. § 455.

As stated in Berger v. United States, 255 U.S. 22 (1927), a judge's adverse attitudes towards a party must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case. The court's ruling was based on the judge's evaluation of the evidence presented and the legal arguments made, and not on any personal bias or preference.

In addition, the court's decision is supported by the principles of fairness and impartiality, as outlined in Section 455(a) of the United States Code. The court's impartiality is crucial to ensure that the proceedings are fair and just, and that the outcome is not influenced by personal biases or preferences.

Furthermore, the court's decision is consistent with the holdings of other courts, including the Supreme Court. In Palazzo v. Gulf Oil Corporation, 764 F.2d 1381 (11th Cir.1985), the court held that a judge's impartiality is not automatically presumed, but must be demonstrated by evidence of actual bias or prejudice. Similarly, in In re K.M.A., Inc., 652 F.2d 398 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), the court emphasized the importance of ensuring that a judge's impartiality is not compromised by personal relationships or biases.

In conclusion, based on the evidence presented and the principles of fairness and impartiality, I believe that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to recuse. The court's decision was based on the judge's impartiality and lack of personal bias, and is consistent with the holdings of other courts.

target_text: As noted above, recusal under § 455(a) is required “in any proceeding in which [a judge’s] impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” thus requiring re-cusal where the judge has acted in such a way as to give the appearance of partiality to a reasonable person. A judge’s rulings and expressions of opinion generally fail to justify recusal. As the Eleventh Circuit has put it, “adverse rulings alone do not provide a party with a basis for holding that the court’s impartiality is in doubt.” Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1075, 1103 (11th Cir.2001). Of course judges hold and express opinions about the litigants and issues that they have formed during court proceedings. But as the Supreme Court succinctly stated in United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966): “The alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source ... other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.”

the court’s dismissal of all of her claims, except her medical malpractice count, against the Nezhats and the Center, and (4) the court’s imposition of monetary sanctions. Byrne appeals the district court’s imposition of monetary sanctions as well. We consider first Manov’s argument that the district court should have recused. II. Section 455(a) of the United States Code states: “Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” On July 8, 1996, one month after the court ordered Rule 11 discovery, Manov moved the district court to recuse pursuant to this statute. The court denied the motion the next day, following a hearing on various matters. Manov renewed the motion on April 23, 1998, two months after the court entered the first sanctions order. The court denied this motion as well. Both of Manov’s motions for recusal were based on the notion that the district court created an appearance of impartiality by having in its chambers a law clerk, McDevitt, who had been employed by one of the law firms representing the Nezhats and the Center in this case and in Mullen’s state court case. Manov’s second motion added another basis for recusal— the court’s rulings against Manov demonstrated that the court’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Due to this additional alleged ground for recusal, we address the motions separately. Our standard of review is whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied Manov’s

To that the court replied: “I can’t understand frankly why you don’t realize that you have forced me to look at the documents in this case, which I dislike doing in advance of trial. You have invited me, therefore, into what I regard as, from your point of view, a rather undesirable situation. I think I made that clear at the beginning. I have told you that, forced by you to look, my views are more extreme than those of the government; and I have also made you realize that if I am required to make Findings and reach Conclusions I am opening up third-party suits that will make, in view of the size of the industry, the percentage of people involved higher than in the electrical cases.” Shortly thereafter defendants filed a motion for the disqualification of Judge Wyzanski on the grounds of personal bias and prejudice. The alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case. Berger v. United States, 255 U. S. 22, 31. Any adverse attitudes that Judge Wyzanski evinced toward the defendants were based on his study of the depositions and briefs which the parties had requested him to make. What he

previous_text: ORDER DENYING MARY ALICE GWYNN’S MOTION TO RECUSE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE
JOHN K. OLSON, Bankruptcy Judge.
THIS CASE is before me on the Verified Motion for Recusal of the Honorable John K. Olson Pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 5004, 28 U.S.C. § 144 and § 144 (the “Recusal Motion”) [DE 299] filed November 30, 2007, by Mary Alice Gwynn (“Ms. Gwynn”), purportedly as a creditor of these chapter 7 debtors, and on Mary Alice Gwynn’s Response to the Court’s Order on Ms. Gwynn’s Purported Compliance with Practice Requirements and Supplement to Mary Alice Gwynn’s Motion for Recusal [DE 311], filed December 11, 2007 (the “Supplemental Motion,” and together with the Recusal Motion, the “Recusal Motions”).
I conducted a hearing on the Recusal Motions on December 17, 2007, and denied them on the record. An excerpted transcript of the relevant portion of that hearing was filed on May 7, 2008, as Docket Entry 322. This Order memorializes my reasons for denying the Recusal Motions.
I. Background
I inherited this case pursuant to Chief Judge Hyman’s Order Transferring Case [DE 278] entered October 30, 2007. That Order was entered after Ms. Gwynn filed her Emergency Motion to Disqualify and Request to Stay Proceedings (the “Emergency Motion”) [DE 276], filed October 29, 2007. In the Order Transferring Case, Judge Hyman correctly ruled that no basis for his disqualification had been stated but that judicial efficiency suggested that it was appropriate to transfer this case to me because a related corporate case, In re It’s All in the Style, Inc., Case No. 05-30362, had been transferred to me in August 2007.
In the Emergency Motion, Ms. Gwynn sought two distinct forms of relief. First, she sought entry of an order disqualifying Chief Judge Hyman from further presiding in this case and to transfer the case to me. Second, she sought a stay of all proceedings in this case pending determination of an appeal now pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. I conducted a hearing on the Emergency Motion on November 7, 2007, and entered an Order denying the relief sought on November 9, 2007 [DE 285], published as In re Hussey, 378 B.R. 397 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.2007). I denied the Emergency Motion as moot to the extent that it sought Judge Hyman’s disqualification and denied the balance of the Emergency Motion on the merits.
The matters giving rise to the Recusal Motions all occurred at the hearing on the Emergency Motion on November 7, 2007, and chiefly arise out of colloquy between Ms. Gwynn and me at that hearing relating to her non-compliance with the Local Rules of this Court. A transcript of that hearing is found at Docket Entry 289 and portions of it are contained in the Recusal Motion.
As I ruled in the Order denying the Emergency Motion, Ms. Gwynn’s pleadings in this case which were then before me did not bear either of the alternative certifications required under this Court’s then-applicable Local Rule 9011-4, which provided in relevant part as follows:
(A) Identification of Attorney. In the signature block of all court papers signed by an attorney, the attorney must be identified by name, state bar number, complete mailing address, telephone number and the name of the party who [sic] the attorney represents.
(B) Certification of Attorney. Papers filed by an attorney appearing:
(1) as a qualified attorney pursuant to Local Rule 2090-l(A) must contain this certification: “I hereby certify that I am admitted to the Bar of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and am in compliance with the additional qualifications to practice in this court set forth in Local Rule 2090-KA).”....
(2) pro hac vice pursuant to Local Rule 2090-l(B)(2) must contain this certification: “I hereby certify that the undersigned attorney is appearing pro hac vice in this matter pursuant to court order dated (date).” This certification shall be placed in papers in the locations described in subdivision (1) above.
In turn, Local Rule 2090-1 provides in relevant part:
Rule 2090-1. Attorneys.
(A) Qualifications to Practice. Except as provided in subdivision (B) of this rule, to be qualified to practice in this court an attorney must:
(1) be a member of the Bar of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida under the Special Rules Governing the Admission and Practice of Attorneys in the District Court;
(2) read and remain familiar with these rules, administrative orders, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, The Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct, and the Bankruptcy Code; and
(3) earn at least 12 credit hours from The Florida Bar for attending or participating in CLE courses related to the subject area of “Bankruptcy Law” during each attorney’s Florida Bar three-year CLE reporting requirement. This provision will not preclude an attorney from appearing who is within a three-year CLE reporting period but who has not yet earned the required 12 hours for that period.
Attorneys appearing pursuant to this subdivision must include on all papers the certification contained in Local Rule 9011-4CB).
(B) Appearances Permitted as Exceptions to Qualification Requirements.
An attorney who has not fulfilled the qualifications to practice set forth in subdivision (A) above may only appear as set forth in this subdivision. Any attorney who appears pursuant to this rule shall be deemed to be familiar with, and shall be governed by, these rules, and the Rules of Professional Conduct and other ethical limitations or requirements governing the professional behavior of members of The Florida Bar.
(1) Appearances in Limited Instances. [Inapplicable here].
(2) Pro Hac Vice Appearances. Any attorney who is a member in good standing of the bar of any state or territory or insular possession of the United States, but is not admitted to practice in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and qualified to practice before this court may, upon the filing and this court’s approval of the Local Form “Motion to Appear Pro Hac Vice” and proposed Local Form “Order Admitted Attorney Pro Hac Vice”, be permitted to appear and participate in a particular case or proceeding. The motion shall designate an attorney who is qualified to practice in this court and who maintains an office in this district for the practice of law with whom the court and opposing counsel may readily communicate regarding the conduct of the case or proceeding and upon whom papers shall be served. The motion must be accompanied by a written statement of the local attorney who consented to the designation, and the name, address and tele phone number of the named des-ignee. The motion shall (a) indicate all bars or courts to which the attorney is admitted; (b) indicate all bars or courts, if any, from which the visiting attorney has been disbarred, suspended or prohibited from appearing in front of and the dates of the foregoing; and (e) certify that the visiting attorney is familiar with and shall be governed by these rules, the Rules of Professional Conduct and all other requirements governing the professional behavior of members of The Florida Bar. Visiting attorneys appearing under this subdivision shall include on all papers filed with the court the certification contained in Local Rule 9011-4(B)(2). Upon written motion and for good cause shown, the court may waive or modify the requirements of designation of qualified local counsel.
In light of these requirements contained in the Local Rules, it was surprising to me that the Emergency Motion contained neither of the alternative certifications mandated by Local Rule 9011-4(A) or Local Rule 9011-4(B)(2). When I raised the absence of either certification with Ms. Gwynn, she asserted — falsely—that she was representing herself and appearing before me pro se. As noted in footnote 1 above, Ms. Gwynn individually is not a creditor of these Debtors. Proof of Claim 18-1 was filed by Gwynn, P.A., and both the proof of claim form and the underlying contract on which it is based so indicate.
Local Rule 9010 — 1(B)(1) prohibits corporations from appearing in proceedings in this Court except in limited circumstances. The Rule provides:
(1) Corporations and Other Business Entities. A corporation, partnership, trust, or other business entity cannot appear or act on its own behalf without counsel in a case or proceeding, except to file a request for service of notices (pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2002), a proof of claim, a response to an objection to its claim, or a ballot, or to attend and inquire at the meeting of creditors held under 11 U.S.C. § 341.
It is clear that the Emergency Motion did not fall within any of the exceptions to Local Rule 9010 — 1(B)(1). Thus, under the Local Rules, Gwynn, P.A. could only appear by an attorney authorized to practice in this Court under Local Rule 2090-1.
Local Rule 9010 — 1(B)(1) is completely consistent with the very long-standing rule that corporations and other artificial entities can act only through their agents, cannot appear pro se, and must be represented by counsel. Commercial & Railroad Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb, 39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 60, 10 L.Ed. 354 (1840); Osborn v. Bank of United States, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738, 6 L.Ed. 204 (1824); Palazzo v. Gulf Oil Corporation, 764 F.2d 1381, 1385-86 (11th Cir.1985); In re K.M.A., Inc., 652 F.2d 398 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981); In re Las Colinas Development Corp., 585 F.2d 7 (1st Cir.1978). There is simply no question that a corporation cannot be represented by someone who is not an authorized attorney, even if that person is the president and sole shareholder of the corporation. Palazzo, supra; Las Colinas, supra.
The question here is whether Ms. Gwynn, despite her failure to certify to her qualification to practice in this Court, is an attorney who could represent Gwynn, P.A., in this case.
I took at face value Ms. Gwynn’s statement to me at the hearing on November 7, 2007, that my questioning her ability to act in this case took her by surprise. It was for that reason that I allowed her to proceed with argument on the substance of the Motion; I did not want to prejudice any substantive rights because of a procedural failure. It was nonetheless necessary to deal with the question as to whether Ms. Gwynn could represent Gwynn, P.A. going forward.
I concluded that Ms. Gwynn could not then represent Gwynn, P.A. in this case. In a very detailed order [DE 1553] entered on June 7, 2006, in another case in this District, In re Walker, Case No. 03-32158-BKC-PGH, Chief Judge Hyman prohibited Gwynn from acting as an attorney in any case in this Court until she establishes the minimal qualifications to do so which are required by this Court’s Local Rules. Specifically, the decretal paragraphs of that Order [DE 1553] provides:
The Court, having reviewed the Response, the Sworn Certification, the docket in this case, having observed Gwynn’s conduct in this Court during the past three years, and being otherwise fully advised in the premises, hereby:
ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that Gwynn shall be prohibited from representing any parties before the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida until she earns 12 credit hours from the Florida Bar for attending or participating in CLE courses related to the subject area of “Bankruptcy Law” which shall mean courses directly related to Title 11 of the United States Code and the Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure.
At the November 7, 2007, hearing on the Emergency Motion, I asked Ms. Gwynn if she had taken any CLE courses in the area of bankruptcy law. She informed me that she had taken five hours of such courses. Manifestly, therefore, she had failed as of that date to comply with the condition precedent imposed by In re Walker that she obtain 12 CLE credit hours from The Florida Bar before she may represent any party in this Court. Thus, not only had Ms. Gwynn failed to comply with the requirements of Local Rules 2090-1 and 9011-4, but she had also failed to comply with the requirements of a valid Order of this Court which had not (and has not) been stayed or reversed on appeal. She has also acknowledged by her own representation made to me at the hearing on the Emergency Motion that she did not then satisfy the minimal practice requirements set forth in Local Rule 2090-1(A)(3). I therefore concluded that Ms. Gwynn could not represent Gwynn, P.A. until and unless she is in full compliance with the Local Rules and with the mandate of Chief Judge Hyman in In re Walker. See [DE 1553] in Walker. Given what Chief Judge Hyman found in Walker was her gross unfamiliarity “with the Court’s Local Rules, administrative orders, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, The Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct, and the Bankruptcy Code,” I prohibited Ms. Gwynn from filing any pleading or representing any party in any case in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida (other than appearances expressly permitted under Local Rule 2090 — 1(B)(1) “Appearances in Limited Instances”) until such time as she provided to me a certified record from The Florida Bar which establishes that she has completed at least 12 hours of Florida Bar approved CLE courses in the area of Bankruptcy Law.
The Recusal Motions assert that my questioning of Ms. Gwynn at the hearing on the Emergency Motion was “not only demeaning, but show a pre-disposition and/or pre-determination against her, indicating the Court cannot be fair and impartial in its rulings.” The Recusal Motions also contend that I have been selective in enforcing the Local Rules “in a discriminating fashion.”
Much of the Recusal Motion is devoted to complaints about proceedings in other courts involving the lawyers who represent the chapter 7 Trustee in this case, Deborah Menotte. Some background is in order. The Walker case referred to above has been a protracted slug-fest involving, among others, Ms. Gwynn and Gary J. Rotella, a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer who represents Trustee Menotte in this case. It is sufficient for purposes of the matters now before me to note that the animosity between Ms. Gwynn and Mr. Rotella (and his firm) is nonpareil. That animosity has overflowed into every matter in contention between these parties, and may help explain the bitterness of the pleadings and the umbrage which Ms. Gwynn took to my questioning her qualifications.
As part of the Order [DE 285] denying the Emergency Motion [DE 276], I prohibited Ms. Gwynn from filing any pleadings in this Court until she was in compliance with the Local Rules. The hearing on the Emergency Motion was held November 7, 2007, and the Order denying the Emergency Motion was entered November 9th. On November 19th, Ms. Gwynn filed a Notice of Compliance [DE 295], asserting that she was in full compliance with the Local Rules. On November 30th, Ms. Gwynn filed the Recusal Motion. On December 4, 2007, I entered an Order on Gwynn’s Purported Compliance with Practice Requirements [DE 302]. The entire text of that Order recites as follows:
This case is before me without a hearing on Mary Alice Gwynn’s Notice of Compliance (the “Notice”) [DE 295] purporting to establish that she is in compliance with the provisions of the Order [DE 285] entered in this case on November 7, 2007, which (among other things) prohibited her from acting on behalf of a corporation in this case because she is not qualified to practice in this Court. The Notice was filed on November 19, 2007.
Ms. Gwynn has now filed a verified motion (the “Motion to Disqualify”) [DE 299] seeking to disqualify me from acting further in this case. The Motion to Disqualify has been set for hearing in the ordinary course on December 17, 2007. In light of the allegations contained in the Motion to Disqualify, which assert that my impartiality might reasonably be questioned, it would be inappropriate for me to consider the Notice or to act in respect of any matters in this case until such time as I have ruled on the Motion to Disqualify. In the event that I grant the Motion to Disqualify, the Notice should of course be considered by a successor judge in this case. In the event that I deny the Motion to Disqualify, the Notice will be considered in due course.
Ms. Gwynn filed the Supplemental Motion on December 11, 2007. In it, she contends that I had “had adequate time to respond to Ms. Gwynn’s Notice prior to the filing of her Motion for Recusal,” and that “for the Court to withhold any ruling for sixteen (16) days, when the Court is well aware that not allowing Creditor, Gwynn, access to file critical, timely pleadings, could have grave impact not only on her practice, but on her personally, and is extremely prejudicial in and of itself.” The Supplemental Motion contends “[f]or the Court to delay reinstatement for any reason, and to deny Gwynn’s access to the Court to file, in violation of her constitutional rights, is further evidence of prejudgment or bias on the part of this Court, which warrants recusal.” Finally, the Supplemental Motion contends (without any citation to evidence) that I am “now working in conjunction with Judge Hyman to ruin her reputation and career, both personally and professionally.”
II. Discussion
The Recusal Motions contend that I should recuse myself from further consideration of this case pursuant to the provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 5004, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 144 and 455. 28 U.S.C. § 144 is clearly inapplicable. It provides as follows:
Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding.
The affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed not less than ten days before the beginning of the term at which the proceeding is to be heard, or good cause shall be shown for failure to file it within such time. A party may file only one such affidavit in any case, It shall be accompanied by a certificate of counsel of record stating that it is made in good faith.
Section 144 is applicable only to proceedings “in a district court,” and has no application to proceedings before a bankruptcy judge. Dubnoff v. Goldstein, 385 F.2d 717, 720 (2nd Cir.1967); Ginger v. Cohn, 255 F.2d 99 (6th Cir.1958); Seidel v. Durkin (In re Goodwin), 194 B.R. 214, 221 (9th Cir. BAP 1996).
By its express terms, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 5004 makes clear that the disqualification of a bankruptcy judge is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 455. Section 455(a) speaks in general terms and requires the recusal of a federal judge, including s bankruptcy judge, “in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” thus requiring recusal not only where the judge has actual bias but also where he or she has acted in such a way as to give the appearance of partiality to a reasonable person. SCA Services, Inc. v. Morgan, 557 F.2d 110, 113-14 (7th Cir.1977). The appearance of impartiality is virtually as important as the fact of impartiality. Webbe v. McGhie Land Title Co., 549 F.2d 1358, 1361 (10th Cir.1977). It is of no consequence that the judge is not actually biased, inasmuch as § 455 concerns not only fairness to individual litigants but also the public’s confidence in the judiciary, which could be irreparably harmed if a case were allowed to proceed before a judge who appears to be tainted. In re Kensington Intern., Ltd., 353 F.3d 211 (3rd Cir.2003); on remand 305 B.R. 175 (D.Del.2004); opinion after remand 368 F.3d 289 (3rd Cir.2004).
In addition to the general requirement of impartiality contained in § 455(a), § 455(b) requires recusal in specific situations, including where the judge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts; where the judge personally or through former law partners or associates was involved in the case or has been a material witness concerning it; where the judge or a close relative is involved in the case; or where the judge, his spouse, or a minor child residing in his household has either a financial interest in the outcome or any other interest which could be substantially affected by the outcome of the case.
Although none of the specific grounds for disqualification specified in § 455(b) apply here, I think it useful to comment on this last provision, that dealing with “financial interest.” A judge is required by § 455(c) to “inform himself about his personal and fiduciary financial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself about the personal financial interests of his spouse and minor children living in his household.” A judge is thus required to recuse him-or herself whenever the judge, his or her spouse, or a minor child living at home owns a single share of stock in a litigant. Union Carbide Corp. v. U.S. Cutting Service, Inc., 782 F.2d 710 (7th Cir.1986). This requirement may seem extreme, but its fundamental wisdom is perhaps best expressed in the following poem by Benjamin Franklin, writing decades before the American Revolution in Poor Richard’s Almanack:
The Complaint
A Farmer once made a complaint to a Judge,
My Bull, if it please you, Sir, owing a Grudge,
Belike to one of your good Worship’s Cattle,
Has slain him out-right in a mortal Battle:
I’m sorry at heart because of the Action, And want to know how must be made Satisfaction.
Why, you must give me your Bull, that’s plain
Says the Judge, or pay me the Price of the Slain.
But I have mistaken the Case, Sir, says John,
The dead Bull I talk of, and please you, ‘s my own:
And yours is the Beast that the Mischief has done.
The Judge soon replies with a serious Face:
Say you so? Then this Accident alters the case.
Section 455 is designed to assure that no federal judge is ever put in a position where his or her financial interests, however minimal, could be cited as having influenced the results of litigation.

The Westinghouse Company's reliance on an informal proof of its claim is unsupported by the established legal standards. In 21 F.2d 182, it is emphasized that a valid amendment requires an original claim to have been filed within the statutory period. Without such a filing, amendment privileges do not apply, as the statute aims to prevent dilatory creditors from filing claims after the deadline. Similarly, 20 F.2d 84 reinforces that informal documentation, which substantially mirrors a formal claim, may support an amendment only if an original proof had been timely submitted.

Furthermore, the precedent set in Hutchinson v. Otis & Co., mentioned in 20 F.2d 84, reflects that bankruptcy courts exhibit liberal discretion in permitting amendments when there is an existing formal or informal basis filed initially. This flexibility, however, does not extend to situations where no foundational claim exists within the statutory period, as addressed in the case In re Schaffner, also cited in 20 F.2d 84.

In this case, since the referee did not receive the mailed proof of claim, its non-receipt fails to constitute the necessary filing requirement, per the ruling in In re R. B. Rose Co., Inc. cited in 43 F.2d 446. Therefore, despite the Westinghouse Company's arguments, the absence of a filed claim within the statutory timeframe precludes the possibility of amendment under established bankruptcy laws and supporting precedents.

In Remington on Bankruptcy, vol. 2, § 747, it is said: “An amendment must be based upon an original claim, filed. And the power of permitting amendment must not be perverted to let in dilatory creditors who have failed to file any proof of claim within the statutory year limited for filing claims. # * * » Again in the same section it is said: “But, at any rate, the original proof need not be formal in order to support an amendment.

Again, a mere letter mentioning the claim, received by receiver and acknowledged by him to the creditor, has been held a sufficient basis.” It would seem from this authority and cases cited in the notes to section 747 that the allowance of the amendment addresses itself largely to the discretion of the court, provided there is a sufficient basis for the amendment. Again in the same authority (section 889), we find: “Of course, there must have been an original proof duly filed within the year; otherwise there would be nothing by whieh to amend; and the power of amendment is not to be distorted to let in dilatory creditors who have filed no proof within the limited year.

On September 17, 1951, the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company filed petition for review of an order of the referee in' bankruptcy entered September 7, 1951. The order appealed from denied the petition of the Westinghouse Company filed May 22, 1951, for leave to amend an alleged informal proof of its claim against the bankrupt by the filing of a formal proof, after the expiration of the six-months’ period allowed for filing claims.
On his voluntary petition Clarence R. Beattie was adjudged a bankrupt January 14, 1949, and George H. Cross was appointed and qualified as trustee of the bankrupt’s estate. The schedules listed the Westinghouse Company as an unsecured judgment creditor in the amount of $1-579.41. On February 2, 1949, attorney Harold H. Smedley of Muskegon, Michigan, who represented the Westinghouse Company, wrote the referee as follows: “Re : Clarence R. Beattie, bankrupt. Will you please advise the date of the first meeting of creditors in the above bankrupt matter?” At a hearing before the referee Smedley testified that with this letter he enclosed a proof of the claim of the Westinghouse Company. However, it appears that this proof of claim was never received by the referee. The next day, February 3d, the referee sent the usual form of notice to all creditors, including the Westinghouse Company and attorney Smedley, informing them that the first meeting of the bankrupt’s creditors would be held February 16th. This notice was never received by the Westinghouse Company, but Smedley testified that he received notice of such first meeting. However, it appears that Smedley was not present and that the Westinghouse Company was not represented at the creditors’ meeting on the 16th.
On April 14, 1949, the attorney for the trustee wrote Smedley as follows:
“I understand that you are local attorney for Westinghouse Electric Supply Company. I represent George FI. Cross, trustee of the above bankrupt (Clarence R. Beat-tie).
“The trustee is informed that on December 15, 1948, the bankrupt made a bulk sale of merchandise to Westinghouse without complying with the Bulk Sales Law. The amount involved was $242.30. The adjudication took place January 14, 1949.
“Will your client voluntarily pay the trustee $242.30 ? Are we misinformed about the transaction?”
On April 15th Smedley replied: “In reference to your letter of April 14, concerning the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company, I represented them in obtaining a judgment against Beattie on January 3, 1949, after having been endeavoring to collect $1,579.41 from them since October 22, 1948. T know of no bulk sales by Beattie to Westinghouse during that period of time. As far as I know and as far as my records disclose -you have been misinformed.”
On May 5th Smedley again wrote the attorney for the trustee: “In furtherance of your letter of April 14th concerning an alleged bulk sale to Westinghouse, there you have been misinformed. There was no such transaction. At one time, Beattie offered to return some merchandise for credit but it was refused. I have verified this with the Detroit attorneys for the Westinghouse Company.”
On September 23, 1949, Smedley wrote the trustee: “I think a further examination should be made as to where all the money went in this bankruptcy. Here is a signed statement Beattie made on January 5, 1948, in which he lists current assets at $53,150, with no liabilities. It was on this statement that the Westinghouse Electric Company sold the merchandise to this man. Will the trustee in bankruptcy do something about it?”
In reply to this last letter, the trustee wrote Smedley on September 24th as follows :
“I am in receipt of your letter of Sept. 23, enclosing statement furnished by the bankrupt to Westinghouse Electric Supply Co. under date of 1-5-48.
“A somewhat similar statement was furnished by the bankrupt to the B. F. Goodrich Company, and the matter was gone into quite fully before the referee in a hearing on the petition of the B. F. Goodrich Co. to reclaim certain merchandise alleged to have been sold in reliance upon such statement. The checks and bank deposit book of the bankrupt disclose that he did actually have on hand approximately $9,000 in cash or in the bank. The real estate which is valued in the statement at $22,500 was his home on Peck Street, the title to which stood in the joint names of himself and wife.
“If you think a further investigation should be made, I would suggest that you file a petition under the provisions of Sect. 21-a of the Bankruptcy Law.
“I am returning the statement which you enclosed.”
On July 20, 1950, Smedley wrote the referee in bankruptcy concerning the Beattie bankruptcy proceeding: “What is the present situation in the above named bankruptcy matter which occurred about a year ago? We filed a claim and never heard anything of it since. Was it closed? Was there any dividend?”
The statutory period for filing claims in the Beattie bankruptcy proceeding expired August 16, 1949. Section 57, sub. n of the Bankruptcy Act as amended, 11 U.S.C. § 93, sub. n, provides: “Except as otherwise provided in this Act, all claims provable under this Act, * * * shall be proved and filed in the manner provided in this section. Claims which are not filed within six months after the first date set for the first meeting of creditors shall not be allowed”.
On May 22, 1951, nearly two years after the expiration of the six-months’ period allowed for filing claims, the Westinghouse Company filed the following petition for leave to amend its alleged proof of claim by the filing of formal proof of claim:
“The petitioner Westinghouse Electric Supply Company, a Michigan corporation, by its attorney Harold H. Smedley, respectfully represents:
“1. That the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company is a judgment creditor of the above named bankrupt on a judgment rendered January 3, 1949 in the circuit court of the county of Muskegon in the amount of $1,579.41, with costs of $24.70.
“2. That a proof of claim of the above named creditor was on February 2, 1949 mailed to the above named referee in bankruptcy for the amount of $1,503.20, which was the amount remaining unpaid on said judgment.
“3. That said proof of claim was never filed in the bankruptcy court and hence said claim has not been allowed, although the claim does appear on the schedules filed with the bankruptcy court by the bankrupt.
“4. That your petitioner has at various times discussed this claim with the trustee and his attorney and that they have both acknowledged the validity and existence of this claim against the bankrupt estate.
“5. That the time for the filing of any new claims has expired the last date of filing being August 16, 1949, and that the claim of your petitioner as a new claim cannot now be duly filed.
“6. That your petitioner prays that an order be entered granting this petitioner the right to amend its claim so that its claim can be properly filed and allowed.”
This petition by Westinghouse to amend its claim appears to be based on the theory that even though it had not filed and proved its claim within the six-months’ period, the correspondence between its attorney and the trustee and his attorney and the referee constituted an informal proof of claim and a sufficient ground for granting leave to amend after the period for filing had expired.
In pursuance of its petition to amend, the Westinghouse Company about July S, 1951, tendered to the referee a formal proof of its claim against the bankrupt. Objections to the petition to amend and to the proposed formal claim were filed by the B. F. Goodrich Company, a creditor of the bankrupt. It appears that prior to the filing of the Westinghouse petition to amend, the trustee in bankruptcy had instituted suit in the circuit court of Muskegon county against the Goodrich Company to set aside certain transfers of property by the bankrupt, on the ground that the transfers were in violation of the so-called bulk sales law. As the amount of the trustee’s recovery in this suit against Goodrich would be limited to a total of the liabilities of the bankrupt, Goodrich as defendant in that suit had a vital interest in the Westinghouse claim, because if it were allowed, the contingent liability of Goodrich to the trustee would be increased by the amount of the claim.
In support of its petition to amend, the Westinghouse Company alleged that a formal proof of its claim was mailed by its attorney to the referee on February 2, 1949.. However, it appears from the record that this proof of claim was never received by the referee. The referee found that no formal claim was filed by the Westinghouse-Company within the statutory six-months’ period and that no informal proof of claim had been established upon which an amendment might be predicated. In its petition for review the Westinghouse Company contends that the referee erred in finding that it had not filed proof of its claim on February 2, 1949, and also erred in finding that it had not made such informal proof of claim as would entitle it to amend by filing formal proof after the expiration of the-six-months’ period.
There appears to be some dispute as to-whether, at the hearing before the referee, attorney Smedley testified that he mailed proof of the Westinghouse claim to the referee on February 2, or November 2,. 1949. However, this would seem to be immaterial, and in this opinion the court will assume that he mailed proof of claim to the referee on February 2, 1949, but that such proof was not received by the referee.
Assuming that proof of its claim was mailed to the referee within the statutory period for filing claims, that fact cannot aid the petitioner. The law is well established that the proof of claim must be- - filed within the statutory period and that merely placing a proof of claim in the mail properly addressed to the referee does not satisfy the filing requirement of section 57,. sub. n of the Bankruptcy Act. In the case of In re R. B. Rose Co., Inc., D.C., 43 F.2d 446, 447, the court said: “Section 57, sub. n * * * provides that ‘claims shall not be proved against a bankrupt estate subsequent to six months after the adjudication * * *.’ There is no statute authorizing the mailing the proof of claim or providing that mailing is sufficient. The creditor who selects-the mail as a vehicle for filing his proof of claim assumes the risk of loss or miscarriage. This is a well-known rule, and the fact that the lost paper is a proof of claim for filing with a referee in bankruptcy creates no exception.” See also In re Harris Bros., D.C., 5 F.Supp. 191.

In the case of Westinghouse Electric Supply Company vs. Beattie, the company filed a petition to amend its alleged proof of claim by filing a formal proof of claim after the expiration of the six-months' period allowed for filing claims. The court has to decide whether the company can amend its claim after the expiration of the statutory period.

According to the reference case 21 F.2d 182, an amendment must be based upon an original claim, filed. The power of permitting amendment must not be perverted to let in dilatory creditors who have failed to file any proof of claim within the statutory year limited for filing claims. The court also stated that the allowance of the amendment addresses itself largely to the discretion of the court, provided there is a sufficient basis for the amendment.

In this case, the Westinghouse Company claimed that it had mailed a proof of claim to the referee on February 2, 1949, but it was never received by the referee. However, the referee found that no formal claim was filed by the Westinghouse Company within the statutory six-months' period and that no informal proof of claim had been established upon which an amendment might be predicated.

The reference case 20 F.2d 84 states that "where a paper presented for filing, although informal, contains the substance of a formal claim, it is sufficient as the basis of an amended claim filed after expiration of the year allowed by Bankruptcy Act, § 57n." However, in this case, the Westinghouse Company failed to file a formal claim within the statutory period and did not establish an informal proof of claim.

In conclusion, the court ruled that the Westinghouse Company cannot amend its claim after the expiration of the statutory period. The company failed to file a formal claim within the statutory period and did not establish an informal proof of claim. The court's decision is in line with the reference cases 21 F.2d 182 and 20 F.2d 84.

Will you please advise the date of the first meeting of creditors in the above bankrupt matter?” At a hearing before the referee Smedley testified that with this letter he enclosed a proof of the claim of the Westinghouse Company. However, it appears that this proof of claim was never received by the referee. The next day, February 3d, the referee sent the usual form of notice to all creditors, including the Westinghouse Company and attorney Smedley, informing them that the first meeting of the bankrupt’s creditors would be held February 16th. This notice was never received by the Westinghouse Company, but Smedley testified that he received notice of such first meeting. However, it appears that Smedley was not present and that the Westinghouse Company was not represented at the creditors’ meeting on the 16th.
On April 14, 1949, the attorney for the trustee wrote Smedley as follows:
“I understand that you are local attorney for Westinghouse Electric Supply Company. I represent George FI. Cross, trustee of the above bankrupt (Clarence R. Beat-tie).
“The trustee is informed that on December 15, 1948, the bankrupt made a bulk sale of merchandise to Westinghouse without complying with the Bulk Sales Law. The amount involved was $242.30. The adjudication took place January 14, 1949.
“Will your client voluntarily pay the trustee $242.30 ? Are we misinformed about the transaction?”
On April 15th Smedley replied: “In reference to your letter of April 14, concerning the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company, I represented them in obtaining a judgment against Beattie on January 3, 1949, after having been endeavoring to collect $1,579.41 from them since October 22, 1948. T know of no bulk sales by Beattie to Westinghouse during that period of time. As far as I know and as far as my records disclose -you have been misinformed.”
On May 5th Smedley again wrote the attorney for the trustee: “In furtherance of your letter of April 14th concerning an alleged bulk sale to Westinghouse, there you have been misinformed. There was no such transaction. At one time, Beattie offered to return some merchandise for credit but it was refused. I have verified this with the Detroit attorneys for the Westinghouse Company.”
On September 23, 1949, Smedley wrote the trustee: “I think a further examination should be made as to where all the money went in this bankruptcy. Here is a signed statement Beattie made on January 5, 1948, in which he lists current assets at $53,150, with no liabilities. It was on this statement that the Westinghouse Electric Company sold the merchandise to this man. Will the trustee in bankruptcy do something about it?”
In reply to this last letter, the trustee wrote Smedley on September 24th as follows :
“I am in receipt of your letter of Sept. 23, enclosing statement furnished by the bankrupt to Westinghouse Electric Supply Co. under date of 1-5-48.
“A somewhat similar statement was furnished by the bankrupt to the B. F. Goodrich Company, and the matter was gone into quite fully before the referee in a hearing on the petition of the B. F. Goodrich Co. to reclaim certain merchandise alleged to have been sold in reliance upon such statement. The checks and bank deposit book of the bankrupt disclose that he did actually have on hand approximately $9,000 in cash or in the bank. The real estate which is valued in the statement at $22,500 was his home on Peck Street, the title to which stood in the joint names of himself and wife.
“If you think a further investigation should be made, I would suggest that you file a petition under the provisions of Sect. 21-a of the Bankruptcy Law.
“I am returning the statement which you enclosed.”
On July 20, 1950, Smedley wrote the referee in bankruptcy concerning the Beattie bankruptcy proceeding: “What is the present situation in the above named bankruptcy matter which occurred about a year ago? We filed a claim and never heard anything of it since. Was it closed? Was there any dividend?”
The statutory period for filing claims in the Beattie bankruptcy proceeding expired August 16, 1949. Section 57, sub. n of the Bankruptcy Act as amended, 11 U.S.C. § 93, sub. n, provides: “Except as otherwise provided in this Act, all claims provable under this Act, * * * shall be proved and filed in the manner provided in this section. Claims which are not filed within six months after the first date set for the first meeting of creditors shall not be allowed”.
On May 22, 1951, nearly two years after the expiration of the six-months’ period allowed for filing claims, the Westinghouse Company filed the following petition for leave to amend its alleged proof of claim by the filing of formal proof of claim:
“The petitioner Westinghouse Electric Supply Company, a Michigan corporation, by its attorney Harold H. Smedley, respectfully represents:
“1. That the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company is a judgment creditor of the above named bankrupt on a judgment rendered January 3, 1949 in the circuit court of the county of Muskegon in the amount of $1,579.41, with costs of $24.70.
“2. That a proof of claim of the above named creditor was on February 2, 1949 mailed to the above named referee in bankruptcy for the amount of $1,503.20, which was the amount remaining unpaid on said judgment.
“3. That said proof of claim was never filed in the bankruptcy court and hence said claim has not been allowed, although the claim does appear on the schedules filed with the bankruptcy court by the bankrupt.
“4. That your petitioner has at various times discussed this claim with the trustee and his attorney and that they have both acknowledged the validity and existence of this claim against the bankrupt estate.
“5. That the time for the filing of any new claims has expired the last date of filing being August 16, 1949, and that the claim of your petitioner as a new claim cannot now be duly filed.
“6. That your petitioner prays that an order be entered granting this petitioner the right to amend its claim so that its claim can be properly filed and allowed.”
This petition by Westinghouse to amend its claim appears to be based on the theory that even though it had not filed and proved its claim within the six-months’ period, the correspondence between its attorney and the trustee and his attorney and the referee constituted an informal proof of claim and a sufficient ground for granting leave to amend after the period for filing had expired.
In pursuance of its petition to amend, the Westinghouse Company about July S, 1951, tendered to the referee a formal proof of its claim against the bankrupt. Objections to the petition to amend and to the proposed formal claim were filed by the B. F. Goodrich Company, a creditor of the bankrupt. It appears that prior to the filing of the Westinghouse petition to amend, the trustee in bankruptcy had instituted suit in the circuit court of Muskegon county against the Goodrich Company to set aside certain transfers of property by the bankrupt, on the ground that the transfers were in violation of the so-called bulk sales law. As the amount of the trustee’s recovery in this suit against Goodrich would be limited to a total of the liabilities of the bankrupt, Goodrich as defendant in that suit had a vital interest in the Westinghouse claim, because if it were allowed, the contingent liability of Goodrich to the trustee would be increased by the amount of the claim.
In support of its petition to amend, the Westinghouse Company alleged that a formal proof of its claim was mailed by its attorney to the referee on February 2, 1949.. However, it appears from the record that this proof of claim was never received by the referee. The referee found that no formal claim was filed by the Westinghouse-Company within the statutory six-months’ period and that no informal proof of claim had been established upon which an amendment might be predicated. In its petition for review the Westinghouse Company contends that the referee erred in finding that it had not filed proof of its claim on February 2, 1949, and also erred in finding that it had not made such informal proof of claim as would entitle it to amend by filing formal proof after the expiration of the-six-months’ period.
There appears to be some dispute as to-whether, at the hearing before the referee, attorney Smedley testified that he mailed proof of the Westinghouse claim to the referee on February 2, or November 2,. 1949. However, this would seem to be immaterial, and in this opinion the court will assume that he mailed proof of claim to the referee on February 2, 1949, but that such proof was not received by the referee.
Assuming that proof of its claim was mailed to the referee within the statutory period for filing claims, that fact cannot aid the petitioner. The law is well established that the proof of claim must be- - filed within the statutory period and that merely placing a proof of claim in the mail properly addressed to the referee does not satisfy the filing requirement of section 57,. sub. n of the Bankruptcy Act. In the case of In re R. B. Rose Co., Inc., D.C., 43 F.2d 446, 447, the court said: “Section 57, sub. n * * * provides that ‘claims shall not be proved against a bankrupt estate subsequent to six months after the adjudication * * *.’ There is no statute authorizing the mailing the proof of claim or providing that mailing is sufficient. The creditor who selects-the mail as a vehicle for filing his proof of claim assumes the risk of loss or miscarriage. This is a well-known rule, and the fact that the lost paper is a proof of claim for filing with a referee in bankruptcy creates no exception.” See also In re Harris Bros., D.C., 5 F.Supp. 191.
