You are a trained lawyer from Silicon Valley with a computer science background. Now, you are asked to annotate legal analysis generated by large language models and classify the errors and mismatch made by these models. To produce these legal analysis, a language model will receive the following prompt:

Here are some reference articles for legal cases: 
# Reference case {case_key_1}
{text of cited case 1} 
# Reference case {case_key_2}
{text of cited case 2}
...
# Reference case {case_key_N} {text of cited case N}
Here is the text I’ve written so far: # Paragrah
{previous_text}
Continue to write it following the style of my writeup. Your answer contains 100 to 400 words. You must explicitly use the reference cases and mention their reference ids, i.e. {case_key_1}, {case_key_2} . . . {case_key_N}. Wrap your answer with <answer></answer>. Make your answer concise and avoid redundant languages.

Receiving the prompt above, a language model will generate a paragraph of legal analysis, but often times they make different kinds of errors and mismatches. 

The instructions for you to classify these errors and mismatches are as follows:

You should classify the LLM-generated legal analysis to these categories:

1. Intrinsic gap:
This category refers to generation that is unacceptable, due to the language model has fundamentally failed to follow the instruction, or make a lot of redundancy, or generate something that does not look like legal text (structural mismatch). More specificially, if it makes one or more of the following:

- Redundancy (sentence-level, appearing as neural degeneration): the generation appears to make repetitive statements that do not add more meaning to the analysis. For example, multiple occurences of an exact sentence or phrase.
- Citation Format Mismatch: the generation appears not matching with the citation format of the standard Bluebook.
    - Please be aware that, for example, 440 U.S. 48, 55' is a proper format. Although its full citation should be 'Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979)', the format '440 U.S. 48, 55' is still acceptable as a concise form.
- Structural Mismatch: the generation appears to generate the document from scratch (like containing words such as "ORDER" which only appear in the beginning).
- Stylistic Mismatch: contain sentences that do not match the styles of legalese.

If this type of gaps is present, add the label `1`. Continue to item 2.

Side note: You should be able to classify this purely based on the generation itself, without having to look at cited examples.

2. Target mismatch:

While language model's generated text may be obviously wrong and substantively different from the target (i.e. the original/target text from the case), the claims it makes are still logically and factually sound and can be seen as acceptable. This could be because
 - Chain Cite: the citations appear in a chain cite but the generation cites them parallely, or the other way around.
    - Clarification: "The rule that certain acts of a creditor in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding and during the statutory period for filing proof of claim, may give rise to something equivalent to a proof of claim and afford a sufficient basis for allowing an amendment after the statutory period for filing, was recognized and applied in many cases decided before the 1938 amendment of the Bankruptcy Act. See In re Atlantic Gulf & Pacific S. S. Corporation, D.C., 26 F.2d 751; In re Fant, D.C., 21 F.2d 182; Globe Indemnity Co. of Newark, N. J., v. Keeble, 4 Cir., 20 F.2d 84; In re Coleman & Titus Corporation, D.C., 286 F. 303; In re Roeber, 2 Cir., 127 F. 122." would be a chain cite because all of these citations support the previous claim "The rule that certain acts of a creditor in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding and during the statutory period for filing proof of claim, may give rise to something equivalent to a proof of claim and afford a sufficient basis for allowing an amendment after the statutory period for filing, was recognized and applied in many cases decided before the 1938 amendment of the Bankruptcy Act."
 - Reverse Cite: the citations reverse the ruling in each other but the generation cites them parallely, or the other way around.
 - Compound Cite: the citations of different cases are cited together, separated by semicolons, or the other way around.
 
 Although it does not match with the target, it is still considered somewhat acceptable, but we should label it out.

 If this type of mismatch is present add the label `2`. Continue to item 3.

3. Citation Mismatch: The language model's generated text does not align with the content of the citation it points to. This might be because one or more of the following:

- Claim Hallucination: the claim supported by the citation is not truthful or not related to the context or from cited paragraphs or the previous context. The generated text makes different and possibly (although not necessarily) contradictory claims about one or more citations, which you can check from comparing to the reference case. Or, the generated text attributes information from one citation to a different citation.
- Retrieval Inaccuracy: the claims supported by the citation is not relevant because the cited paragraph looks irrelevant compared to the target paragraph. 
- Citation Hallucination: the citation is non-existent or pulled from a citation in the cited paragraphs or the previous context, or there misses a citation (the generated text fails to use one of the citations that were given to it).

If this type of mismatch is **present**, add the label `3` and move on to the next example. If none of the above errors are present, label '0'.

Here are some examples for demonstration:

In the context of reopening Miss Fowler’s 1968 claim, relevant precedent supports such a measure due to administrative errors. Specifically, in 514 F.2d 561, the court allowed reopening where evidence revealed a clear error on the face of the record. The similarities with Mrs. Lauritzen's case are striking; both involved overlooked evidence and procedural errors. Moreover, 527 F.2d 224 further emphasizes that initial, revised, or reconsidered claims may be reopened if clerical or evident errors are detected.

Applying these principles, we find the Secretary's refusal to reopen Miss Fowler’s 1968 claim to be legally unsupported. The evidence demonstrates errors that warrant reconsideration, thus fitting within the regulatory framework as outlined in the reference cases. Consequently, we remand the case to the Secretary for a substantive review of the 1968 claim, ensuring compliance with the established legal standards set forth in the cases of 514 F.2d 561 and 527 F.2d 224.

target_text: 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8) provides that a final decision may be reopened at any time “for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.” As the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said in Lauritzen v. Wein-berger, 514 F.2d 561, 563 (8th Cir. 1975), the question for the Social Security Administration on any claim for reopening is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, or whether there is manifest error in the record. This inquiry, in opting for a flexible approach to the doctrine of res judicata, supports the view expressed by this court in Coulter v. Weinberger, 527 F.2d 224, 228 (3d Cir. 1975):

The application was denied and then referred, on Mrs. Lauritzen’s request, to an administrative law judge for decision. He stated that he assumed the matter had been referred to him pursuant to 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8).

The hearing officers’ pre-occupation with the claimant’s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider all of the applicable regulations and to overlook a number of other significant factors which would have a bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim. Because of the error of the Social Security Administration in 1959, there was no determination at that time as to whether Coulter was disabled.

previous_text: OPINION OF THE COURT
WEIS, Circuit Judge.
Claimant Merle Fowler is presently disabled by multiple sclerosis. Hampered by the necessity to establish an onset date within her coverage period, she has been unsuccessful in securing disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. Difficulties in proof abound, for the disease is a progressive one, the initial date of disability is seldom easy to determine, and periods of remission are common. And as if these problems were not enough, they were compounded by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare’s loss or destruction of critical records relating to claimant’s first application for benefits. After a thorough review of the case, we conclude the HEW determination that no disability existed on the last day of coverage, June 30, 1966 is not supported by the evidence. Finding adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record, we remand to the Secretary for consideration of Miss Fowler’s request to reopen because of error on the record.
From the early 1950’s on, Miss Fowler worked for various medical schools as a recordkeeper, secretary, and nurse. From 1963 to 1967, she was employed at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. That institution did not participate in the Social Security program and her coverage earned while at other jobs terminated on June 30,1966. Claimant’s testimony before the administrative law judge revealed that it was during her service at U.C.L.A. that she began to encounter increasingly serious and bizarre physical disabilities. These difficulties included: problems in maintaining her balance that were severe enough to attract accusations of being intoxicated or under the influence of drugs; a four-week period during which she had to crawl because of an inability to stand; slurred speech resulting in communication problems with coworkers and patients; difficulty in typing. Miss Fowler was forced to use up all of her vacation time as well as her sick leave because of her illness. Additionally, she often found it necessary to rest over long lunch hours.
Miss Fowler continued to cling to her employment because she was living alone and was her own sole means of support. In February 1967, her condition was such that she could no longer be retained even by the most sympathetic and understanding employer. At about this time her condition was finally diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. She then went to live with her sister in Florida, and for a period of about a year and a half was both bedridden and mentally disoriented. During this interval, her sister filed a disability claim for her with the Social Security Administration, which was rejected, according to the sister, because the claimant did not have enough quarters of coverage.
The claimant enjoyed a period of remission from 1970 to 1973 when she was able to obtain limited employment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but thereafter her disease was again disabling. She filed for disability benefits on March 25, 1974, alleging disability from 1965. After an initial denial, the Secretary referred her case for disability evaluation to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation. That agency, based on information that severe symptoms were observable at some time in 1965 or early 1966, concluded that a closed period of disability was established between December 31, 1965 and February 1, 1970, when remission occurred. The Secretary, however, disallowed the payment of any benefit because the 1974 claim had been filed more than twelve months after the first period of disability had ceased in 1970. See 42 U.S.C. § 416(i)(2)(E). The claimant then requested a hearing, asserting that the 1968 claim filed by her sister had been erroneously denied and should be reopened. On the basis of the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation disability evaluation, claimant believed she was entitled to benefits for the 1965 — 1970 period. The ALJ, however, bypassed the 1968 claim issue altogether, finding instead that there had been no disability before June 30, 1966. The Appeals Council affirmed and the district court ruled there was substantial evidence supporting the Secretary’s decision.
Looking first to the determination of the onset of disability, we conclude that there is not substantial evidence to support the ALJ’s decision.
The claimant’s description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing. She tried desperately to hold her job and exerted extraordinary efforts to cope with her disability. Her case did not rely upon her testimony alone but was supported by several statements from persons familiar with her at that time. A letter from Justine Walker, a coworker, was received into evidence and corroborated Miss Fowler’s account of her difficulties. In addition, the detailed statements of two physicians who were aware of her condition during the period were made part of the record. Dr. Donald A. Adams, her treating physician, stated:
“[Bjeyond question . . . she had multiple sclerosis dating back probably to 1965 and early 1966.”
He said further:
“were she an employee of mine during late 1965 and early 1966 I would have had no other alternative except to terminate her due to her illness even though the consequences would have been that she would be unable to procure another job.”
Dr. Jack A. Cannon, her employer in 1965, said that she should not have been working at that time.
“However, in considering what would happen to her if I did recommend that she be terminated, I had to realize that she would be unable to secure another position because of the problems, and that I could not recommend her for other employment based on her mental and physical condition.”
Her physician at the time of the hearing, Dr. Lawrence D. Ellis, came to a similar opinion after reviewing Miss Fowler’s records. He believed she was unable to engage in substantial gainful employment for a period beginning in late 1965. Moreover, the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation report, which, after careful study, found that disability existed as of December 31, 1965, was totally ignored in the ALJ’s decision. The ALJ did not refer to any of the foregoing evidence, but merely summarized the medical reports relating to the disability period prior to June 30, 1966 as giving “no indication of severe and protracted disability prior to that date.”
This conclusory statement misses the mark on several counts. It fails to observe the appropriate legal standard, whether claimant is unable “to engage in any substantial gainful activity,” 42 U.S.C. §§ 416(i)(l), 423(d)(1), and substitutes a far harsher requirement. Additionally, the statement is directly contrary to the evidence submitted by the physicians familiar with claimant’s condition. In fact, it is not supported by any medical opinion in this case. As we commented in Gober v. Matthews, 574 F.2d 772, 777 (3d Cir. 1978), an ALJ is not free to set his own expertise against that of physicians who present competent medical evidence.
The ALJ’s opinion drew some unsupported inferences from the fact that claimant had been employed by physicians. The ALJ commented, “it is axiomatic that physicians take care of their own.” The thrust of this remark is somewhat obscure because the record indicates the employers did take care of claimant by retaining her for a longer period than that which could be justified by her failing health. To that extent, the “axiom” tends to support Miss Fowler’s claim that she continued to work even though physically incapable of performing the tasks demanded of her. Moreover, her employment after the cut-off date does not foreclose an award of benefits since disability “turns on whether she was disabled within the meaning of the Act notwithstanding the fact that she actually did work.” Stark v. Weinberger, 497 F.2d 1092, 1100 (7th Cir. 1974).
We find it particularly puzzling that the ALJ ignored the findings on disability reached by the state agency to which the Secretary had referred the matter. That expert body made a determination of disability on less evidence than was submitted to the ALJ. Although findings by other agencies are not binding on the Secretary, they are entitled to weight and must be considered. We said in an early case that the evaluation of disability by the Veterans Administration was critically relevant and material in a parallel Social Security ease. Pulaski v. Finch, 415 F.2d 613, 618 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Cutler v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir. 1975); DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92,101 (5th Cir. 1972). And in a case quite similar to the one at bar, Dunbar v. Califano, 454 F.Supp. 1261 (W.D.N.Y.1978), the court expressed disapproval over an ALJ’s failure to consider the disability finding of a state agency consulted by the Secretary.
After careful review of the record, we are convinced that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period, and the Secretary’s determination to the contrary cannot stand. Indeed, absent the question of timely filing, we would enter judgment for the plaintiff at this point.
We must now, then, consider the effect of the 1968 claim. The 1974 application would not be timely if it constituted the original claim because it was filed more than twelve months after the closed disability period terminated in 1970. The claimant, however, asked that the 1974 claim be considered as one requesting a reopening of the original application filed on her behalf some six years earlier.

**Generation:**



In examining the case, we find that the Social Security Administration's determination that no disability existed on the last day of coverage, June 30, 1966, is not supported by the evidence. Reference case 514 F.2d 561 highlights the importance of considering all applicable regulations and overlooking significant factors that may impact the correct adjudication of a claim. In this case, the administrative law judge's preoccupation with the claimant's earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider critical evidence and overlook significant factors that would have bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim.

Furthermore, reference case 527 F.2d 224 emphasizes the need to correct clerical errors or errors on the face of the evidence when reopening a claim. In this case, the claimant's testimony and medical records provide adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record and support the reopening of the claim.

We conclude that the claimant's description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing, and the evidence submitted by physicians familiar with her condition supports her claim. The administrative law judge's opinion misses the mark, and we find that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period.

Therefore, we remand the case to the Secretary for consideration of the claimant's request to reopen because of error on the record. We also note that the claimant's request to reopen the 1968 claim is timely, and we will consider this request in conjunction with the Secretary's decision on the reopened claim.

That expert body made a determination of disability on less evidence than was submitted to the ALJ. Although findings by other agencies are not binding on the Secretary, they are entitled to weight and must be considered. We said in an early case that the evaluation of disability by the Veterans Administration was critically relevant and material in a parallel Social Security ease. Pulaski v. Finch, 415 F.2d 613, 618 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Cutler v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir. 1975); DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92,101 (5th Cir. 1972). And in a case quite similar to the one at bar, Dunbar v. Califano, 454 F.Supp. 1261 (W.D.N.Y.1978), the court expressed disapproval over an ALJ’s failure to consider the disability finding of a state agency consulted by the Secretary.
After careful review of the record, we are convinced that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period, and the Secretary’s determination to the contrary cannot stand. Indeed, absent the question of timely filing, we would enter judgment for the plaintiff at this point.
We must now, then, consider the effect of the 1968 claim. The 1974 application would not be timely if it constituted the original claim because it was filed more than twelve months after the closed disability period terminated in 1970. The claimant, however, asked that the 1974 claim be considered as one requesting a reopening of the original application filed on her behalf some six years earlier.

Furthermore, the claim of non-invention is supported by prior case law which emphasizes the necessity for innovative contribution beyond mere aggregation of pre-existing elements. In reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court determined that a patent merely combining old elements without producing a new function or result was not inventive. Similarly, reference case 106 F.2d 554 reinforces this stance by negating claims that don't advance the existing technical field in a substantive way.

In the present case, Anderson '125's integration of a rotary cutter with spray guns to simultaneously deposit fiberglass and resin fails to constitute a novel invention as defined in these precedents. The combination of these elements, while potentially convenient, does not produce any unforeseen or novel functional results, reflecting the lessons from 219 F.2d 952 and 106 F.2d 554. Thus, the cumulative effect of prior art decisively points to the conclusion that the Anderson '125 patent lacks the necessary inventive step for patentability.

target_text: Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No. 2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise. The method and apparatus claimed by claim 11 of Anderson ’314 “would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * * ” (35 U.S.C.A. § 103) upon perceiving that the strand roving fell to the ground when the operator stopped the machine. “[I]t is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result.” Application of Demarche, 219 F.2d 952, 955, 42 CCPA 793 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 1955). Again, our conclusions in this regard are influenced by the fact that so little time elapsed between the introduction of roving in strands and the application for Anderson’s main patent. Compare Forestek Plating & Mfg. Co. v. Knapp-Monarch Co., 106 F.2d 554, 557 (6 Cir. 1939) (validity of improvement patent upheld in light of prior, repeated unsuccessful efforts).

winding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant’s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof. The Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel. When the thread breaks (or when the tension thereof decreases), the arm drops

This appeal is from judgment for plaintiff-appellee in a patent infringement suit, Ibis Enterprises, Ltd. v. Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court’s findings of fact as follows:
1. Parties
Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida, Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.
2. Civil Action
This is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.
3. Background of Patentee
David F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the “Vidal” process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: “hand lay-up” and “matched die (or metal) mold” (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).
4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method
The “Vidal” process involved, in part, the “hand lay-up” process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the “Vidal” process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).
5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method
(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called “matched metal mold” or “matched die” process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).
(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).
6. Anderson Early Work and Invention
(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the “matched metal mold” process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *
7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125
(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;
“the depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.” (Column 2, lines 39-52).
The form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).
(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:
“The present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.” (Column 1, lines 55-65).
'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed ■only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim ■6). * * ■*
11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit
(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).
(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff’s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend “Patented Process” while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs’ Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *
Yj * * *
(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).
(b) In the Defendant’s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).
18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs’
Each of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).
At this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the “clearly erroneous” limitation.
Second, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of “primary,” as opposed to “ultimate” fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).
Third, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court’s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court’s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.
Fourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. § 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.
Directing our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the “rather severe test” promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?” Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to “scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.” Ibid.
In light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson’s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.
As the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general — problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the “clearly erroneous” limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.
It is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson’s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson’s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).
Pursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson’s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of “obviousiness” and “newness” of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes — both relating to the making of pre-form — combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).
The final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson’s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at
143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, “in that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.” (Anderson deposition at 117).
A discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court’s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court’s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had “abandoned” its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility’s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson’s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.
Although certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson’s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.
The California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson’s case for improvement over the prior art as being “limited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.” Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).
Having thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson’s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention — subjecting Anderson ’125 to the “rather severe test” outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson ’125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of “obviousness” of the Anderson combination.
While it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus “occurred to me the moment I saw the roving.” (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or ’51, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson ’125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson’s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson’s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).
From this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson ’125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. § 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining “obviousness” under 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve — the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .
To summarize, the Anderson ’125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements “perform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that
“patentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun — a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.”
Our conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson ’125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.
Implicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.

In the context of patent infringement, the concept of obviousness is crucial in determining the validity of a patent. The court needs to consider whether a person of ordinary skill in the field would have arrived at the claimed invention without resorting to inventive ingenuity. In the case of Anderson's patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.

In the reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court held that the patent in question did not meet the requirements of patentability because it was obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field. Similarly, in the reference case 106 F.2d 554, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.

In the case of Anderson's patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious because it was a combination of old elements that were well-known in the field. The court noted that the prior art references, such as the Thompson and Lampe patents, showed that the simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder was already known. The court also noted that the use of a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid was also known in the prior art.

Furthermore, the court found that the claimed invention did not have any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements. The court noted that the materials used in the prior art references did not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics, but the court still found that the prior art references were relevant to the issue of obviousness.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Anderson's patents was influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The court's finding of obviousness was based on the combination of old elements that were well-known in the field, and the court did not find any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements.

target_text: Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No. 2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise. The method and apparatus claimed by claim 11 of Anderson ’314 “would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * * ” (35 U.S.C.A. § 103) upon perceiving that the strand roving fell to the ground when the operator stopped the machine. “[I]t is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result.” Application of Demarche, 219 F.2d 952, 955, 42 CCPA 793 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 1955). Again, our conclusions in this regard are influenced by the fact that so little time elapsed between the introduction of roving in strands and the application for Anderson’s main patent. Compare Forestek Plating & Mfg. Co. v. Knapp-Monarch Co., 106 F.2d 554, 557 (6 Cir. 1939) (validity of improvement patent upheld in light of prior, repeated unsuccessful efforts).

winding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant’s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof. The Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel. When the thread breaks (or when the tension thereof decreases), the arm drops

This appeal is from judgment for plaintiff-appellee in a patent infringement suit, Ibis Enterprises, Ltd. v. Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court’s findings of fact as follows:
1. Parties
Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida, Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.
2. Civil Action
This is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.
3. Background of Patentee
David F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the “Vidal” process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: “hand lay-up” and “matched die (or metal) mold” (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).
4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method
The “Vidal” process involved, in part, the “hand lay-up” process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the “Vidal” process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).
5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method
(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called “matched metal mold” or “matched die” process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).
(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).
6. Anderson Early Work and Invention
(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the “matched metal mold” process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *
7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125
(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;
“the depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.” (Column 2, lines 39-52).
The form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).
(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:
“The present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.” (Column 1, lines 55-65).
'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed ■only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim ■6). * * ■*
11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit
(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).
(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff’s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend “Patented Process” while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs’ Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *
Yj * * *
(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).
(b) In the Defendant’s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).
18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs’
Each of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).
At this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the “clearly erroneous” limitation.
Second, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of “primary,” as opposed to “ultimate” fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).
Third, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court’s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court’s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.
Fourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. § 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.
Directing our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the “rather severe test” promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?” Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to “scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.” Ibid.
In light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson’s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.
As the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general — problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the “clearly erroneous” limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.
It is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson’s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson’s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).
Pursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson’s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of “obviousiness” and “newness” of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes — both relating to the making of pre-form — combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).
The final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson’s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at
143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, “in that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.” (Anderson deposition at 117).
A discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court’s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court’s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had “abandoned” its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility’s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson’s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.
Although certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson’s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.
The California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson’s case for improvement over the prior art as being “limited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.” Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).
Having thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson’s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention — subjecting Anderson ’125 to the “rather severe test” outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson ’125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of “obviousness” of the Anderson combination.
While it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus “occurred to me the moment I saw the roving.” (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or ’51, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson ’125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson’s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson’s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).
From this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson ’125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. § 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining “obviousness” under 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve — the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .
To summarize, the Anderson ’125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements “perform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that
“patentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun — a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.”
Our conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson ’125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.
Implicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.

This stringent interpretation contrasts sharply with the intent of the 1963 amendments to Rule 25 and Rule 6(b), which aimed to inject flexibility and fairness into the substitution process. As noted in 379 F.2d 94 and 359 F.2d 292, the amendments were designed to eliminate the inequities and hardships caused by the rigid two-year limitation originally imposed. The Advisory Committee emphasized that the revised rules were to be liberally construed to allow courts discretion in extending the substitution period, recognizing the difficulties that could arise in promptly identifying and notifying the proper representative of the deceased. 

Given this context, the defendant’s counsel's suggestion of death, which lacked identification of a proper representative, failed to initiate the 90-day countdown. This interpretation aligns with the judicial precedent that courts should prioritize the equitable administration of justice over strict procedural formalities. Thus, the district court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs' action without granting the requested extension, especially considering the circumstances that inhibited timely substitution, such as the injury to plaintiffs' counsel and the ongoing legal processes in the probate court.

We, therefore, reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, ensuring that the substitution process adheres to the flexible and just principles intended by the amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

previous_text: LEVENTHAL, Circuit Judge:
The District Court held that Rule 25(a) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure required dismissal of the plaintiffs’ tort action because defendant’s counsel had filed a suggestion of death of the defendant yet plaintiff had not made any substitution of parties within 90 days. We reverse on the ground that the suggestion of death, which was neither filed by nor identified a successor or representative of the deceased, such as an executor or administrator, was ineffective to trigger the running of the 90-day period provided by the Rule.
Mr. and Mrs. John Rende filed an action in the District Court individually and on behalf of their infant son who had been struck and injured by Alfred S. Kay while driving his car. On August 27, 1967, defendant Kay died. On September 1, 1967, the defendant’s attorney, a term used here to identify the lawyer who had been retained by deceased to defend the action, and who had duly entered an appearance as attorney for defendant, filed a suggestion of death in the District Court, giving notice to plaintiffs’ attorney. That same day there was filed in the Orphans Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, residence of the deceased, his will naming his widow as executrix, but the will had not been probated, nor any legal representative appointed for the estate at the time of the filing of this appeal.
Plaintiffs’ attorney was injured on October 14, 1967. On returning to practice early in 1968, he learned that no successor to defendant Kay had yet been appointed, and he moved to certify the case to the ready calendar. The defendant’s attorney opposed this on grounds that discovery procedures had not been completed. The case was delayed and placed on the ready calendar as of June 7, 1968.
However, in April 1968, the defendant’s attorney moved in his own name to dismiss the action on the ground that Rule 25(a) (1) required plaintiffs to move to substitute a proper party for the deceased within 90 days of the suggestion of death. Plaintiffs filed an opposition and motion for substitution of the proper party, and sought an extension of the time for substitution as allowed by Rule 6(b). At argument, plaintiffs’ counsel asserted the “suggestion of death was defective in that it did not list the name of the proper party; that is the legal representative of the defendant.” The court responded: “That would not be his burden.” The court dismissed the action with prejudice.
Prior to its amendment in 1963, Rule 25(a) (1) required the court to dismiss a case if no motion for substitution was filed within two. years after date of death, and no extensions of this period were allowed under Rule 6(b). The rule was rigorously applied, often with harsh results, and was called “easily the poorest rule of all the Federal Rules.” In 1955 the Advisory Committee on Rules for Civil Procedure recommended that the two-year period be changed to a “reasonable time” standard. In 1961 the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules again suggested the Rule be made more flexible. In 1963 the Supreme Court made changes in Rule 25(a) (1) and in Rule 6(b) so as to provide a 90-day time limit from the filing of a suggestion of death, and to give the court discretion to extend that time.
The Committee Notes explaining the amendments state:
Present Rule 25(a) (1), together with present Rule 6(b), results in an inflexible requirement that an action be dismissed as to a deceased party if substitution is not carried out within a fixed period measured from the time of death. The hardships and inequities of this unyielding requirement plainly appear from the cases. * * * The amended rule establishes a time limit for the motion to substitute based not upon the time of the death, but rather upon the time information of the death is provided by means of a suggestion of death upon the record. * * * A motion to substitute may be made by any party or by the representative of the deceased party without awaiting the suggestion of death. Indeed, the motion will usually be so made. If a party or the representative of the deceased party desires to limit the time within which another may make the motion, he may do so by suggesting the death upon the record. (Emphasis added.)
Under the amended Rule either a party or “the successors or representatives of the deceased party” may avoid delay in effecting substitution for the deceased party either by filing a motion for substitution or by suggesting death on the record and thus triggering the 90-day period which begins with suggestion of death.
The Advisory Committee, in outlining that suggestion of death could be made by “the representative of the deceased party” plainly contemplated that the suggestion emanating from the side of the deceased would identify a representative of the estate, such as an executor or administrator, who could be substituted for the deceased as a party, with the action continued in the name of the representative. The addition of “successor” in the Rule would take care of the case of, say, the distributee of an estate that had been distributed, but would not make a material difference in the aspect under consideration. Form 30, for suggestion of death, which was provided in order to expedite and facilitate implementation of the amendment, provides:
A.B. [described as a party, or as executor, administrator, or other representative or successor of C.D., the deceased party\ suggests upon the record, pursuant to Rule 25(a) (1), the death of C.D. [describe as party] during the pendency of this action. Added Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963. [Emphasis added.]
Although the attorney for the defendant was retained to “represent” the deceased as his counsel, he is not a person who could be made a party, and is not a “representative of the deceased party” in the sense contemplated by Rule 25(a) d).
In our opinion the Rule, as amended, cannot fairly be construed, as the de fendant’s attorney argues, to make his suggestion of death operative to trigger the 90-day period even though he was neither a successor nor representative of the deceased, and gave no indication of what person was available to be named in substitution as a representative of the deceased. Counsel’s construction would open the door to a tactical maneuver to place upon the plaintiff the burden of locating the representative of the estate within 90 days.
We can conceive of cases wherein even the lawyer retained to represent a defendant might know the defendant had died, yet not readily know where his estate would be administered. In the present case, plaintiff’s attorney did know the court of probate, but he did not know whether probate of the will might be contested, or who would be appointed representative of the estate. The tactic of the defendant’s attorney would place on plaintiff the burden, where no conventional representative was appointed for the estate in probate court, of instituting machinery in order to produce some representative of the estate ad litem, pending appointment of the representative contemplated by law of the domicile of the deceased.

**Generation:**

In the context of Rule 25(a) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the suggestion of death is a crucial step in the process of substituting a deceased party with a proper representative. However, not all suggestions of death are created equal. In cases where the suggestion of death is made by a party's attorney, but fails to identify a successor or representative of the deceased, the 90-day period for substitution may not be triggered.

As noted in 359 F.2d 292, the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules intended to provide a more flexible standard for substitution, allowing for extensions of time and dispensing with the rigid two-year period previously in place. However, this flexibility is contingent upon the suggestion of death providing sufficient information to permit the court to proceed with substitution.

In the present case, the suggestion of death made by the defendant's attorney was deficient in that it failed to identify a successor or representative of the deceased. This lack of specificity rendered the suggestion ineffective in triggering the 90-day period for substitution, as explained in 379 F.2d 94.

Furthermore, the court's discretion to enlarge the time period for substitution, as provided by Rule 6(b), is not a blank check. Rather, it is intended to be exercised in a judicious and reasonable manner, taking into account the particular circumstances of each case.

In light of these principles, we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the action with prejudice. The case should be remanded for further proceedings, allowing the parties to properly substitute a representative of the deceased and continue the action in a manner consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

In considering the objections to the magistrate's report, it is crucial to reference the Federal Magistrate’s Act, 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), which has been extensively interpreted in several cases. As highlighted in 616 F.2d 603 and 678 F.2d 376, any party may serve and file written objections to the magistrate's proposed findings and recommendations within ten days, allowing a judge to make a de novo determination of contested portions.

In the case at hand, the magistrate directed that objections should be filed within ten days, paralleling the procedure noted in 474 U.S. 140, where failure to file timely objections can result in waiver of the right to appeal. Despite the potential for review sua sponte by the district judge, as occurred in 474 U.S. 140, such a provision underscores the importance of adhering to procedural rules.

Therefore, in alignment with judicial precedents (616 F.2d 603, 678 F.2d 376, 474 U.S. 140), this court adopts the magistrate’s report and recommendations. Consequently, the claims in Count I are adequately detailed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), and further discovery will entail a comprehensive review post-pretrial, ensuring due process and judicial economy.

Report and recommendation of the magistrate is adopted.

Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. (Emphasis suppl.) Basically, the dispute between the parties centers upon the effect of the phrase “may serve and file written objections.” Defendants assert that a party may decide not to file, but that filing is obligatory if he is dissatisfied. Plaintiffs’ position is that the district court has a duty to review the magistrate’s recommendations in any event, and that the losing party need file objections only if he wishes a hearing. Although the court cited its Local Rule 7(c), this rule is of no assistance. Other than referring to the statute itself, it is limited to “appeal[s]” from orders under subsection (b)(1)(A). We turn, accordingly, to the statute. There are three possible areas of consideration: the statutory language, the statutory purpose, and the legislative history. First, plaintiffs point to the

Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. The judge may also receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate with instructions. (B) a judge may also designate a magistrate to conduct hearings, including evi-dentiary hearings, and to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition, by a judge of the court, of any motion excepted in subparagraph (A), of applications for posttrial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses and of prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement.

The last page of the Magistrate’s report contained the prominent legend: “ANY OBJECTIONS to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of Courts within ten (10) days of receipt of this notice. Failure to file objections within the specified time waives the right to appeal the District Court’s order. See: United States v. Walters, 638 F. 2d 947 (6th Cir. 1981).” Despite this clear notice, petitioner failed to file objections at any time. She sought and received an extension of time to file objections through June 15, 1982, on the grounds that “this case entails many substantive issues and counsel needs more time to write his brief.” However, petitioner made no further submissions on the merits to the District Court.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT (# 29)
Feb. 27, 1989.
ROBERT B. COLLINGS, United States Magistrate.
Terry Howard, Byron Roseman and Frederick Wikander are three Massachusetts physicians who were trustees of Medical Associates, a Massachusetts business trust. Chelmsford Medical Associates, Inc., a professional corporation, is alleged to be the successor-in-interest of Medical Associates.
The instant case arises out of agreements reached whereby the defendant would sell and grant certain licenses respecting a computer system for use by the business trust. The Second Amended Complaint contains claims for intentional or negligent misrepresentation (Count I), breach of contract (Count II), breach of warranties (Count III), negligence/computer malpractice (Count IV) and unfair or deceptive acts and practices (Count V). Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.
I RECOMMEND that all but one of the grounds listed in the Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss The Amended Complaint (# 29) be DEFERRED for resolution at the PreTrial Conference when discovery has been completed. See Rule 12(d), Fed.R.Civ.P. The reason for this recommendation is that the defendant does not assert that all of the claims in the Second Amended Complaint (as opposed to the Amended Complaint) are subject to dismissal. Specifical ly, to the extent that Count II of the Second Amended Complaint contains a claim by plaintiffs Howard, Roseman and Wikander for breach of contract, defendant does not contend that Count II is subject to dismissal. Since the case will go forward on that claim regardless of whether the other claims are dismissed and since the scope of discovery would be approximately the same regardless of whether or not the other claims are dismissed at this time, it seems to me in the interests of judicial economy to defer the motion to dismiss the other claims until after the issues respecting those claims have been sharpened by the discovery process.
The one exception is the claim that the counts sounding in fraud and misrepresentation are not pleaded with the particularity required by Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. This type of issue should not be deferred.
This is not the first time I have reviewed plaintiffs’ pleadings to determine if the allegations of fraud have complied with Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. On February 12, 1988,1 issued a Memorandum (# 20) indicating that although the content of the misrepresentations was adequately pleaded, the pleadings were defective because of the failure to state the time and place of the alleged misrepresentations.
In the Amended Complaint (# 26) and in the Second Amended Complaint (# 62), plaintiffs have sought to rectify this deficiency. They claim they have done so; defendant disagrees.
Count I of the Second Amended Complaint alleging misrepresentation is divided into two parts. The first deals with misrepresentations allegedly made before the parties entered into a written contract; the second deals with misrepresentations made after the written contract was signed.
Paragraph 34 concerns misrepresentations made before the contract was signed and reads as follows:
34. To induce Chelmsford Medical Associates to enter into the Systems Purchase Agreement, Cycare falsely represented the features, performance and quality of the system and the nature and quality of Cycare’s support services, and falsely represented the benefits to Chelmsford Medical Associates of using the system. Specifically, and without limitation, Cycare made the representations as described in paragraph 11, above.
Paragraph 11 contains twelve subparts (a through 1) which list “representations” allegedly made. After each of the subparts, a “specification” of time and place is set forth in parentheses. The “specifications” are similar. Examples are:
a. (This representation was made during the one-site demonstration and in documentation.)”
c. “... (This representation was made in the on-site and off-site demonstrations, during the on-site visits and during telephone discussions between the parties.)”
g. “... (These representations were made during the on-site and off-site demonstrations, during the on-site visits and in the Written Proposal and in the documentation.)”
Paragraph 8 contains dates and places of a number of these events. The on-site demonstration occurred at the plaintiffs’ offices on May 23-24, 1985. The “Written Proposal” was made on or about June 24, 1985. The “off-site” demonstration occurred on June 26-27, 1985 at Memphis, Tennessee. It is further alleged that “additional on-site visits by Cycare to Chelmsford [occurred] during the period July-September, 1985.” Lastly, it is alleged that the telephone conversations occurred between May, 1985 and the date of the execution of the written contract, i.e., September 30, 1985.
The second group of alleged misrepresentations is alleged to have occurred after September 30,1985. Paragraphs 35 and 36 of the Second Amended Complaint read as follows:
35. To induce Chelmsford Medical Associates to continue to use a defective system, CyCare falsely represented that it could and would remedy the malfunctions and problems with the computer system. These representations were made beginning in approximately March, 1986 when the first computer run was made on the CyCare system, and continued to be made up to and including June, 1987. These representations were made by CyCare while present at Chelmsford Medical Associates’ site, including but not limited to meetings in March 1986, April 1986, July 1986, October 1986 and March 1987 and in telephone conversations throughout the period, including but not limited to the following correspondence:
a. letter dated August 6, 1986 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
b. letter dated August 21, 1986 from David Bennett to Alan Carr-Locke;
c. letter dated September 24, 1986 from David Bennett to Alan Carr-Locke;
d. letter dated October 13, 1986 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
e. letter dated October 25, 1986 from Lorraine Hess to Alan Carr-Locke;
f. letter dated March 30, 1987 from Lorraine Hess to Dick Farrar;
g. letter dated April 6, 1987 from Daniel A. Wolfe to Diane Richards;
h. letter dated April 22, 1987 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
i. letter dated May 22, 1987 from Daniel A. Wolfe to Byron Roseman, M.D.
The resolution of whether plaintiffs have now complied with Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ. P., is governed by the five most recent First Circuit cases construing Rule 9(b), Fed.R. Civ.P., i.e. McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., 633 F.2d 226, 228 (1 Cir.,1980); Wayne v. Gulf Oil Corp., 739 F.2d 11 (1 Cir.,1984); Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., 754 F.2d 430 (1 Cir.,1985); Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441 (1 Cir.,1985) and New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, 829 F.2d 286 (1 Cir.,1987).
In McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., the Court wrote:
The clear weight of authority is that Rule 9 requires specification of time, place and content of an alleged false representation but not the circumstances or evidence from which fraudulent intent could be inferred, [citations omitted] This interpretation of Rule 9 comports with its language, harmonizes the rule with Rule 8, which requires that averments in pleadings be concise and direct, and at the same time fulfills a major purpose of Rule 9: to give adequate notice of the plaintiff’s claim of fraud or mistake, [citations omitted]
Id., 633 F.2d at 228-29.
In Wayne v. Gulf Oil Corp., the Court added “... that allegations based on ‘information and belief' do not satisfy the particularity requirement unless the complaint sets forth the facts on which the belief is founded ... and that the requirement that supporting facts be pleaded applies even when the fraud relates to matters within the knowledge of the opposing party.” Id., 739 F.2d at 13-14.
In Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., the Court noted that the “purpose of the rule [9(b) ] is to protect the defendant from unfair surprise and to discourage ‘strike suits.’ ” Id., 754 F.2d at 439. In addition, the Court wrote:
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(f) provides that “all pleadings shall be construed so as to do substantial justice.” Considered as a whole, we find that the facts and circumstances pleaded in the complaint were sufficient to give notice to [the defendant] of the nature of the claims against it and find no error in the district court’s consideration of fraud, [citation omitted]
Id. at 440.
In Hayduk v. Lanna, the Court wrote:
One of the main purposes of [Rule 9(b) ] is to apprise the defendant of fraudulent claims and of the acts which form the basis of the claim, [citations omitted] In other words, ‘[i]n cases in which fraud lies at the core of the action, the rule does not permit a complainant to file suit first, and subsequently to search for a cause of action.’ Lopez v. Bulova Watch Co., Inc., 582 F.Supp. 755, 766 (D.R.I.1984) (citing Deyhle v. Barclay Investments, Inc., No. 82-0662, slip op. at 4 (D.R.I. Oct. 13, 1983)) (emphasis added).
Id., 775 F.2d at 443.
Lastly, in New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, the Court considered the applicability of Rule 9(b) to predicate acts of mail and wire fraud which were pleaded in a RICO claim. The Court held that “Rule 9(b) requires specificity in the pleading of RICO mail and wire fraud [and] [t]his degree of specificity is no more nor less than we have required in fraud and securities fraud cases.” Id., 829 F.2d at 290 (citations omitted). In so holding, the Court wrote that:
Generally, there are three purposes behind Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirement: (1) to place the defendants on notice and enable them to prepare meaningful responses; (2) to preclude the use of a groundless fraud claim as a pretext to discovering a wrong or as a “strike suit”; and (3) to safeguard defendants from frivolous charges which might damage their reputations, [citations omitted]
Id., 829 F.2d at 289.
The Court specifically noted that in determining whether Rule 9(b) is satisfied, a Court must “keep in mind” these three major purposes of Rule 9(b).
Applying these principles to the case at bar, it becomes apparent that the Second Amended Complaint complies with the provisions of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. Therefore, I RECOMMEND that Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss The Amended Complaint (# 29) be deemed to seek dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint and that to the extent that the motion seeks dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint on the ground that it fails to plead fraud and misrepresentation with the requisite degree of particularity, the motion be DENIED.
First, all but two of the misrepresentations alleged in paragraph 11 (made before the written contract was executed) are alleged to have been made at either the “on-site demonstration” or the “off-site demonstration” or both. The dates and places of both the “on-site demonstration” and the “off-site demonstration” are stated with particularity in paragraph 8. The other two misrepresentations are alleged to have been made at “on-site visits.” Since “on-site” refers to the plaintiffs’ business premises, the place of the misrepresentations is pleaded with particularity. The time is specified in paragraph 8 as being within the three months period from July through September, 1985. In the circumstances, I view this as sufficient particularity.
Second, each of the alleged misrepresentations made after the written contract was signed are alleged to have been made in nine pieces of correspondence which are listed by date, sender, and recipient in paragraph 35 of the Second Amended Complaint. This is sufficient particularity as to time and place for the purposes of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.
Third, I view the allegations respecting misrepresentations made both before and after the written contract was executed as being sufficient when considering the purposes of Rule 9(b). The allegations give sufficient notice of the basis of the allegations of fraud to enable the defendant to prepare a meaningful response. In view of the sufficiency of the breach of contract claim which arises out of the same set of circumstances, it can hardly be said that the fraud claim is a pretext to discovering a wrong or that the fraud claim is being used as a “strike suit.” Roberts v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co., Inc., 653 F.Supp. 406, 415-16 (D.Mass., 1986). Lastly, the fraud claim cannot be labelled as frivolous.
Fourth, in view of what I have indicated regarding the sufficiency as to time and place of misrepresentations made at on-site and off-site demonstrations and at on-site visits and in correspondence, I do not find a violation of Rule 9(b) in the allegations that the same misrepresentations were also made in unspecified telephone calls between agents of the parties during the specified time periods. Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., is to be harmonized with Rule 8(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., which provides for a “short and plain statement of the claim.” There would be no harmony between the two rules if a plaintiff, in order to comply with Rule 9(b), had to list every time and place at which a specific misrepresentation was repeated.
Lastly, I do not see a violation of Rule 9(b) in the failure of the plaintiff to identify the specific agent of the defendant who made each misrepresentation. Although other courts have construed Rule 9(b) as requiring an identification of the maker of the misrepresentation, none of the First Circuit cases indicate that such identification is a prerequisite to compliance with Rule 9(b); all that is required is a specification of time, place and content. To be sure, I can envisage some circumstances in which an identification might well be required. For example, if a complaint alleged only a single misrepresentation by an agent of a defendant and specified the time, place and content but not the identity of the agent, it could well be argued that the defendant-corporation would need further specification in order to make a meaningful response to the claim. But the circumstances of the instant case are different. There appears to have been an extended period of dealings between the parties culminating in a written contract which both sides acknowledge as having executed. I cannot see how a specification of the identity of the defendant’s agents who allegedly made the misrepresentations is necessary in order for the defendant to understand the basis of the fraud claim and to be able to respond to it.

I am happy to help you with your query. Based on the reference cases you provided, specifically 616 F.2d 603, 678 F.2d 376, and 474 U.S. 140, I can assist you in analyzing the legal issues related to the Federal Magistrates Act and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

In the reference case 616 F.2d 603, the court held that a party may choose not to file objections to a magistrate's report and recommendation, but if they do file objections, the objections must be served and filed within the specified time period. This is in line with the statutory language and purpose of the Federal Magistrates Act.

In the reference case 678 F.2d 376, the court emphasized the importance of specificity in pleading fraud and misrepresentation claims. The court held that allegations based on "information and belief" do not satisfy the particularity requirement unless the complaint sets forth the facts on which the belief is founded.

In the reference case 474 U.S. 140, the court reiterated the importance of specificity in pleading fraud and misrepresentation claims. The court held that Rule 9(b) requires specification of time, place, and content of an alleged false representation, and that allegations based on "information and belief" do not satisfy the particularity requirement.

Based on these reference cases, it is clear that the Federal Magistrates Act and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require specificity and particularity in pleading fraud and misrepresentation claims. The courts have emphasized the importance of providing adequate notice to defendants of the alleged fraudulent conduct and the need to specify the time, place, and content of the alleged misrepresentations.

In the context of the instant case, it appears that the Second Amended Complaint complies with the requirements of Rule 9(b) and the Federal Magistrates Act. The complaint provides sufficient specificity and particularity in pleading the alleged misrepresentations and provides adequate notice to the defendants of the alleged fraudulent conduct.

In conclusion, based on the reference cases and the analysis provided, it is clear that the Federal Magistrates Act and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require specificity and particularity in pleading fraud and misrepresentation claims. The courts have emphasized the importance of providing adequate notice to defendants of the alleged fraudulent conduct and the need to specify the time, place, and content of the alleged misrepresent

for the disposition, by a judge . . .” The Act further provides, (C) [T]he magistrate shall file his proposed findings and recommendations under subparagraph (B) with the court and a copy shall forthwith be mailed to all parties. Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. (Emphasis suppl.) Basically, the dispute between the parties centers upon the effect of the phrase “may serve and file written objections.” Defendants assert that a party may decide not to file, but that filing is obligatory if he is dissatisfied. Plaintiffs’ position is that the district court has a duty to review the magistrate’s recommendations in any event, and that the losing party need file objections only if he wishes a hearing. Although the court cited its Local Rule 7(c), this rule is of no assistance. Other than referring to the statute itself, it is limited to “appeal[s]” from orders under subsection (b)(1)(A). We turn, accordingly, to the statute. There are three possible areas of consideration: the statutory language, the statutory purpose, and the legislative history. First, plaintiffs point to the

This was an incorrect assumption. The Federal Magistrate’s Act, 28 U.S.C. § 631 et seq. reads in pertinent part: parties. Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. The judge may also receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate with instructions. (B) a judge may also designate a magistrate to conduct hearings, including evi-dentiary hearings, and to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition, by a judge of the court, of any motion excepted in subparagraph (A), of applications for posttrial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses and of prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement.

admit the proffered testimony had not impaired the fundamental fairness of the trial, and therefore was not an adequate ground for habeas corpus relief. The last page of the Magistrate’s report contained the prominent legend: “ANY OBJECTIONS to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of Courts within ten (10) days of receipt of this notice. Failure to file objections within the specified time waives the right to appeal the District Court’s order. See: United States v. Walters, 638 F. 2d 947 (6th Cir. 1981).” Despite this clear notice, petitioner failed to file objections at any time. She sought and received an extension of time to file objections through June 15, 1982, on the grounds that “this case entails many substantive issues and counsel needs more time to write his brief.” However, petitioner made no further submissions on the merits to the District Court. Notwithstanding petitioner’s failure to file objections, the District Judge sua sponte “review[ed] . . . the entire record de novo,” App. 59, and dismissed the petition on the merits.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT (# 29)
Feb. 27, 1989.
ROBERT B. COLLINGS, United States Magistrate.
Terry Howard, Byron Roseman and Frederick Wikander are three Massachusetts physicians who were trustees of Medical Associates, a Massachusetts business trust. Chelmsford Medical Associates, Inc., a professional corporation, is alleged to be the successor-in-interest of Medical Associates.
The instant case arises out of agreements reached whereby the defendant would sell and grant certain licenses respecting a computer system for use by the business trust. The Second Amended Complaint contains claims for intentional or negligent misrepresentation (Count I), breach of contract (Count II), breach of warranties (Count III), negligence/computer malpractice (Count IV) and unfair or deceptive acts and practices (Count V). Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.
I RECOMMEND that all but one of the grounds listed in the Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss The Amended Complaint (# 29) be DEFERRED for resolution at the PreTrial Conference when discovery has been completed. See Rule 12(d), Fed.R.Civ.P. The reason for this recommendation is that the defendant does not assert that all of the claims in the Second Amended Complaint (as opposed to the Amended Complaint) are subject to dismissal. Specifical ly, to the extent that Count II of the Second Amended Complaint contains a claim by plaintiffs Howard, Roseman and Wikander for breach of contract, defendant does not contend that Count II is subject to dismissal. Since the case will go forward on that claim regardless of whether the other claims are dismissed and since the scope of discovery would be approximately the same regardless of whether or not the other claims are dismissed at this time, it seems to me in the interests of judicial economy to defer the motion to dismiss the other claims until after the issues respecting those claims have been sharpened by the discovery process.
The one exception is the claim that the counts sounding in fraud and misrepresentation are not pleaded with the particularity required by Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. This type of issue should not be deferred.
This is not the first time I have reviewed plaintiffs’ pleadings to determine if the allegations of fraud have complied with Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. On February 12, 1988,1 issued a Memorandum (# 20) indicating that although the content of the misrepresentations was adequately pleaded, the pleadings were defective because of the failure to state the time and place of the alleged misrepresentations.
In the Amended Complaint (# 26) and in the Second Amended Complaint (# 62), plaintiffs have sought to rectify this deficiency. They claim they have done so; defendant disagrees.
Count I of the Second Amended Complaint alleging misrepresentation is divided into two parts. The first deals with misrepresentations allegedly made before the parties entered into a written contract; the second deals with misrepresentations made after the written contract was signed.
Paragraph 34 concerns misrepresentations made before the contract was signed and reads as follows:
34. To induce Chelmsford Medical Associates to enter into the Systems Purchase Agreement, Cycare falsely represented the features, performance and quality of the system and the nature and quality of Cycare’s support services, and falsely represented the benefits to Chelmsford Medical Associates of using the system. Specifically, and without limitation, Cycare made the representations as described in paragraph 11, above.
Paragraph 11 contains twelve subparts (a through 1) which list “representations” allegedly made. After each of the subparts, a “specification” of time and place is set forth in parentheses. The “specifications” are similar. Examples are:
a. (This representation was made during the one-site demonstration and in documentation.)”
c. “... (This representation was made in the on-site and off-site demonstrations, during the on-site visits and during telephone discussions between the parties.)”
g. “... (These representations were made during the on-site and off-site demonstrations, during the on-site visits and in the Written Proposal and in the documentation.)”
Paragraph 8 contains dates and places of a number of these events. The on-site demonstration occurred at the plaintiffs’ offices on May 23-24, 1985. The “Written Proposal” was made on or about June 24, 1985. The “off-site” demonstration occurred on June 26-27, 1985 at Memphis, Tennessee. It is further alleged that “additional on-site visits by Cycare to Chelmsford [occurred] during the period July-September, 1985.” Lastly, it is alleged that the telephone conversations occurred between May, 1985 and the date of the execution of the written contract, i.e., September 30, 1985.
The second group of alleged misrepresentations is alleged to have occurred after September 30,1985. Paragraphs 35 and 36 of the Second Amended Complaint read as follows:
35. To induce Chelmsford Medical Associates to continue to use a defective system, CyCare falsely represented that it could and would remedy the malfunctions and problems with the computer system. These representations were made beginning in approximately March, 1986 when the first computer run was made on the CyCare system, and continued to be made up to and including June, 1987. These representations were made by CyCare while present at Chelmsford Medical Associates’ site, including but not limited to meetings in March 1986, April 1986, July 1986, October 1986 and March 1987 and in telephone conversations throughout the period, including but not limited to the following correspondence:
a. letter dated August 6, 1986 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
b. letter dated August 21, 1986 from David Bennett to Alan Carr-Locke;
c. letter dated September 24, 1986 from David Bennett to Alan Carr-Locke;
d. letter dated October 13, 1986 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
e. letter dated October 25, 1986 from Lorraine Hess to Alan Carr-Locke;
f. letter dated March 30, 1987 from Lorraine Hess to Dick Farrar;

h. letter dated April 22, 1987 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
i. letter dated May 22, 1987 from Daniel A. Wolfe to Byron Roseman, M.D.
The resolution of whether plaintiffs have now complied with Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ. P., is governed by the five most recent First Circuit cases construing Rule 9(b), Fed.R. Civ.P., i.e. McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., 633 F.2d 226, 228 (1 Cir.,1980); Wayne v. Gulf Oil Corp., 739 F.2d 11 (1 Cir.,1984); Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., 754 F.2d 430 (1 Cir.,1985); Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441 (1 Cir.,1985) and New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, 829 F.2d 286 (1 Cir.,1987).
In McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., the Court wrote:
The clear weight of authority is that Rule 9 requires specification of time, place and content of an alleged false representation but not the circumstances or evidence from which fraudulent intent could be inferred, [citations omitted] This interpretation of Rule 9 comports with its language, harmonizes the rule with Rule 8, which requires that averments in pleadings be concise and direct, and at the same time fulfills a major purpose of Rule 9: to give adequate notice of the plaintiff’s claim of fraud or mistake, [citations omitted]
Id., 633 F.2d at 228-29.
In Wayne v. Gulf Oil Corp., the Court added “... that allegations based on ‘information and belief' do not satisfy the particularity requirement unless the complaint sets forth the facts on which the belief is founded ... and that the requirement that supporting facts be pleaded applies even when the fraud relates to matters within the knowledge of the opposing party.” Id., 739 F.2d at 13-14.
In Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., the Court noted that the “purpose of the rule [9(b) ] is to protect the defendant from unfair surprise and to discourage ‘strike suits.’ ” Id., 754 F.2d at 439. In addition, the Court wrote:

One of the main purposes of [Rule 9(b) ] is to apprise the defendant of fraudulent claims and of the acts which form the basis of the claim, [citations omitted] In other words, ‘[i]n cases in which fraud lies at the core of the action, the rule does not permit a complainant to file suit first, and subsequently to search for a cause of action.’ Lopez v. Bulova Watch Co., Inc., 582 F.Supp. 755, 766 (D.R.I.1984) (citing Deyhle v. Barclay Investments, Inc., No. 82-0662, slip op. at 4 (D.R.I. Oct. 13, 1983)) (emphasis added).
Id., 775 F.2d at 443.
Lastly, in New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, the Court considered the applicability of Rule 9(b) to predicate acts of mail and wire fraud which were pleaded in a RICO claim. The Court held that “Rule 9(b) requires specificity in the pleading of RICO mail and wire fraud [and] [t]his degree of specificity is no more nor less than we have required in fraud and securities fraud cases.” Id., 829 F.2d at 290 (citations omitted). In so holding, the Court wrote that:
Generally, there are three purposes behind Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirement: (1) to place the defendants on notice and enable them to prepare meaningful responses; (2) to preclude the use of a groundless fraud claim as a pretext to discovering a wrong or as a “strike suit”; and (3) to safeguard defendants from frivolous charges which might damage their reputations, [citations omitted]
Id., 829 F.2d at 289.
The Court specifically noted that in determining whether Rule 9(b) is satisfied, a Court must “keep in mind” these three major purposes of Rule 9(b).
Applying these principles to the case at bar, it becomes apparent that the Second Amended Complaint complies with the provisions of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. Therefore, I RECOMMEND that Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss The Amended Complaint (# 29) be deemed to seek dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint and that to the extent that the motion seeks dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint on the ground that it fails to plead fraud and misrepresentation with the requisite degree of particularity, the motion be DENIED.
First, all but two of the misrepresentations alleged in paragraph 11 (made before the written contract was executed) are alleged to have been made at either the “on-site demonstration” or the “off-site demonstration” or both. The dates and places of both the “on-site demonstration” and the “off-site demonstration” are stated with particularity in paragraph 8. The other two misrepresentations are alleged to have been made at “on-site visits.” Since “on-site” refers to the plaintiffs’ business premises, the place of the misrepresentations is pleaded with particularity. The time is specified in paragraph 8 as being within the three months period from July through September, 1985. In the circumstances, I view this as sufficient particularity.
Second, each of the alleged misrepresentations made after the written contract was signed are alleged to have been made in nine pieces of correspondence which are listed by date, sender, and recipient in paragraph 35 of the Second Amended Complaint. This is sufficient particularity as to time and place for the purposes of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.
Third, I view the allegations respecting misrepresentations made both before and after the written contract was executed as being sufficient when considering the purposes of Rule 9(b). The allegations give sufficient notice of the basis of the allegations of fraud to enable the defendant to prepare a meaningful response. In view of the sufficiency of the breach of contract claim which arises out of the same set of circumstances, it can hardly be said that the fraud claim is a pretext to discovering a wrong or that the fraud claim is being used as a “strike suit.” Roberts v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co., Inc., 653 F.Supp. 406, 415-16 (D.Mass., 1986). Lastly, the fraud claim cannot be labelled as frivolous.
Fourth, in view of what I have indicated regarding the sufficiency as to time and place of misrepresentations made at on-site and off-site demonstrations and at on-site visits and in correspondence, I do not find a violation of Rule 9(b) in the allegations that the same misrepresentations were also made in unspecified telephone calls between agents of the parties during the specified time periods. Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., is to be harmonized with Rule 8(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., which provides for a “short and plain statement of the claim.” There would be no harmony between the two rules if a plaintiff, in order to comply with Rule 9(b), had to list every time and place at which a specific misrepresentation was repeated.
Lastly, I do not see a violation of Rule 9(b) in the failure of the plaintiff to identify the specific agent of the defendant who made each misrepresentation. Although other courts have construed Rule 9(b) as requiring an identification of the maker of the misrepresentation, none of the First Circuit cases indicate that such identification is a prerequisite to compliance with Rule 9(b); all that is required is a specification of time, place and content. To be sure, I can envisage some circumstances in which an identification might well be required. For example, if a complaint alleged only a single misrepresentation by an agent of a defendant and specified the time, place and content but not the identity of the agent, it could well be argued that the defendant-corporation would need further specification in order to make a meaningful response to the claim. But the circumstances of the instant case are different. There appears to have been an extended period of dealings between the parties culminating in a written contract which both sides acknowledge as having executed. I cannot see how a specification of the identity of the defendant’s agents who allegedly made the misrepresentations is necessary in order for the defendant to understand the basis of the fraud claim and to be able to respond to it.
