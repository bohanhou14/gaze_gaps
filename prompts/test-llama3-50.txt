Upon reviewing the reference articles, I noticed that they all deal with legal cases related to habeas corpus, Atkins, and the Eighth Amendment. The cases involve intellectual disability, competency, and the application of federal laws.

In the case of Weathers v. Texas, --- U.S. ----, 137 S.Ct. 1039, 197 L.Ed.2d 416 (2017), the Supreme Court held that the Briseño factors "may not be used... to restrict qualification of an individual as intellectually disabled." Moore v. Texas, --- U.S. ----, 137 S.Ct. 1039, 197 L.Ed.2d 416 (2017). This decision was applied retroactively in the case of Shoop v. Hill, --- U.S. ----, 139 S. Ct. 504, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2019).

In another case, Davis v. Warden, 854 F.3d 967, the court held that the miscarriage-of-justice exception is inapplicable when a petitioner does not assert an actual-innocence claim. Additionally, the court noted that the Supreme Court has clearly established that a defendant must receive adequate notice of the charges against him. Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196, 201, 68 S.Ct. 614, 92 L.Ed. 644 (1948).

In the case of Hill v. Warden, 881 F.3d 483, the court considered the issue of intellectual disability and found that the Ohio Court of Appeals' determination was unreasonable. The court noted that the Supreme Court has clearly established that a defendant must receive adequate notice of the charges against him and that the Briseño factors may not be used to restrict qualification of an individual as intellectually disabled.

Overall, these cases demonstrate the importance of considering the application of federal laws in legal proceedings and the need for adequate notice of charges against a defendant. They also highlight the role of the Supreme Court in establishing precedents and guidelines for lower courts to follow.

(citation and alteration omitted) (emphases in the original). “The federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.” Id.

III. DISCUSSION A. Certified Issue—Adequate Notice of the Attempted Rape Special Circumstance Cain contends that habeas relief is warranted because he did not receive adequate notice of the attempted rape special circumstance and the prosecutor improperly relied on an attempted rape special circumstance that was not charged in the information. The Supreme Court has clearly established that a defendant must receive adequate notice of the charges against him. “No principle of procedural due process is more clearly established than that notice of the specific charge, and a chance to be heard in a trial of the issues raised by that charge, if desired, are among the constitutional rights of every accused in a criminal proceeding in all courts, state or federal....” Cole v.

122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993) (emphasis added). This rule is called the “fundamental miscarriage of justice exception.” Id. Here, Davis has not asserted an actual-innocence claim; that is, he is not arguing “that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of ... new evidence.” Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 327, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995). Therefore, the miscarriage-of-justice exception is inapplicable. C. Ripeness Finally, Davis argues that while he “raised a claim challenging his sentence of death under Atkins in previous proceedings, see Davis, 423 F.3d at 878-79, he now, for the first time, raises a claim that Atkins prohibits his actual execution.” According to Davis, his “claim that the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution of an intellectually disabled person was not ripe until his warrant was issued.” We reject this argument. The two cases that Davis relies on—Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986), and Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. 637, 118 S.Ct. 1618, 140 L.Ed.2d 849 (1998)—involved the issue of competency, not intellectual disability. In Ford, the Supreme Court held that “the Eighth Amendment prohibits the State from inflicting the penalty of death upon a prisoner who is insane.” 477 U.S. at 410, 106 S.Ct. 2595. In Martinez-Villareal, the Supreme Court held that § 2244’s ban on successive petitions does not apply to a petitioner’s Ford claim that his scheduled execution would violate the Eighth Amendment because he is incompetent.

in Moore. Whereas Moore’s intellectual functioning based on IQ was debatable, Hill’s IQ is so low that the Warden concedes that Hill satisfies the first element of the definition. We recognize that Moore was decided after the Ohio Court of Appeals rejected Hill’s Atkins claim in .2008. See State v. Hill, 177 Ohio App.3d 171, 894 N.E.2d 108, 127 (2008). Ordinarily, Supreme Court decisions that post-date a state court’s determination cannot be “clearly established law” for the purposes of AEDPA. Peak v. Webb, 673 F.3d 465, 472 (6th Cir. 2012) (Under AEDPA, the “law in question must have been clearly established at the time the state-court decision became final,, not after.”). However, as discussed in more detail below, we find that Moore’s holding regarding adaptive strengths is merely an application of what was clearly established by Atkins. In light of the Ohio Court of Appeals’ unreasonable determinations under both the adaptive-skills and age-of-onset prongs of the Atkins standard, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case with instructions to grant the petition and to issue the writ of habeas corpus with respect to Hill’s death sentence. In addition to his Atkins claim, Hill raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that attacks his trial counsel’s performance during his state Atkins hearing, a Miranda claim arguing that certain statements should have been suppressed during his trial, a prosecutorial misconduct claim, and a due process claim arguing that Hill was not competent to stand trial at the time

previous_text: EDITH H. JONES, Circuit Judge:
This case was remanded from the Supreme Court of the United States for reconsideration in light of its decision in Moore v. Texas , --- U.S. ----, 137 S.Ct. 1039, 197 L.Ed.2d 416 (2017). There, on direct appeal, the Supreme Court held that the Briseño factors "may not be used ... to restrict qualification of an individual as intellectually disabled." Moore , 137 S.Ct. at 1044 ; see Ex parte Briseño , 135 S.W.3d 1, 3 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), abrogated by Moore v. Texas , --- U.S. ----, 137 S.Ct. 1039, 197 L.Ed.2d 416 (2017). Because applying Moore retroactively to this case contradicts the Court's recent decision in Shoop v. Hill, --- U.S. ----, 139 S. Ct. 504, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2019), we affirm the district's court's judgment
BACKGROUND
Obie Weathers III was convicted of the 2000 capital murder of Ted Church and was sentenced to death for that crime. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, Weathers v. State, 2003 WL 22410067 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 22, 2003). Then followed two rounds of state habeas review, the last of which concerned his Atkins claim and was resolved against him in 2014. In Weathers v. Davis, 659 F. App'x 778 (5th Cir. 2016), cert. granted , judgment vacated , --- U.S. ----, 138 S.Ct. 315, 199 L.Ed.2d 203 (2017), this court denied a COA to appeal the federal district court's rejection of habeas relief on his Atkins claim.
Weathers sought certiorari from the Supreme Court, urging for the first time that Texas's Briseño factors used as an adjunct to clinical findings of mental retardation were unconstitutional. In light of Moore , the Supreme Court granted his petition and remanded the case to this court for further consideration. We granted a COA and obtained additional briefing from both parties to consider whether the state courts' rejection of Weathers's Atkins claim was reasonable in light of Moore .
In 2016, this court summarized the facts of this case:
After a crime spree involving a string of burglaries, theft, one murder, and one sexual assault of an elderly man over the course of just a few months, one evening in February, 2000, Weathers entered Pierce's Ice House, a tavern in San Antonio, Texas, wielding a handgun and concealing his face with a pillowcase with eyeholes cut out. Weathers informed the patrons that he intended to rob the ice house, but he told the three black men present to remain calm because he only wanted to rob the white individuals. Weathers robbed the white patrons, then ordered a waitress at gun point to empty the cash register. While the waitress was carrying the till to Weathers, she stumbled and Weathers pointed his gun at her head. At this time, one of the bar patrons, Ted Church ... swung at and grabbed Weathers. In the ensuing struggle, Weathers shot Church twice in the head and once in the abdomen. Weathers fled with over two-hundred dollars, but he was apprehended eleven days later and confessed to this and other crimes. Church was rushed to the hospital and underwent multiple surgeries, but he died weeks later from irreparable damages to his pancreas caused by the gunshot wound.
Weathers , 659 F. App'x at 779-80.
This court's 2016 opinion discusses at length Weathers's various appeals and concluded that reasonable jurists could not debate the district court's denial of his Atkins -claim. That opinion also examines the facts underlying his contention that the state court inappropriately credited the State's medical expert while discrediting Weathers's expert. This court also noted "the dearth of evidence concerning the third prong of Briseño (adopting the AAMR), whether any intellectual disability and adaptive deficits were evident before age 18." Weathers , 659 F. App'x at 789.
DISCUSSION
We granted a COA on remand from the Supreme Court, received further briefing, and reviewed the district court's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. Martinez v. Johnson, 255 F.3d 229, 237 (5th Cir. 2001). To obtain federal habeas relief from state custody, AEDPA requires the petitioner to demonstrate that the state court's adjudication of the claim "resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law," 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), or "resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding," id. § 2254(d)(2). Williams v. Stephens , 761 F.3d 561, 566 (5th Cir. 2014). Events following the remand have rendered further discussion of many of the parties' arguments unnecessary.
We adhere to this court's previous decision because the Supreme Court has just affirmed that lower courts may not properly apply Moore retroactively in habeas corpus to state court decisions that preceded it. Shoop v. Hill, 139 S. Ct. at 506 (holding that Moore was not "clearly established law" under AEDPA regarding execution of the mentally disabled in 2008 when the Ohio Court of Appeals rejected a petitioner's Atkins claim).
