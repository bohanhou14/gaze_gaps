The Railroad appeals from the district court's order enforcing an award of Public Law Board No. 1998, sustaining the claim of G.L. Choate, a former employee of the Railroad, against his dismissal from service. The district court correctly enforced the award, as it is only set aside if the Public Law Board failed to comply with the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction, or there was fraud or corruption by a member of the Board. The award must be enforced, as there is no allegation of any of these factors.

The Railroad argues that the district court erred by ordering reinstatement with back pay, rather than simply reinstating Choate to his former position with seniority. However, the award requires good faith compliance, and reinstatement with back pay is necessary to ensure compliance. In Lakeland Bus Lines, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 278 F.2d 888, the court held that an order directing reinstatement with back pay requires a good faith reinstatement. Similarly, in N.L.R.B. v. Interurban Gas Co., 354 F.2d 76, the court ruled that an employer's offer to reinstate an employee is not compliance with the terms of an award if the offer is a sham.

In this case, the Railroad's offer to reinstate Choate was a sham, as it only offered reinstatement with seniority, without providing a job or back pay. The district court correctly ordered reinstatement with back pay, as this is necessary to ensure compliance with the award. The Railroad's appeal is denied, and the district court's order is affirmed.

4, 1962, because his work was not satisfactory. The record shows that he was assigned to cut weeds and grass and to do odd jobs of painting. The Board found that this did not constitute a good faith reinstatement to his former or a substantially equivalent position. There were sharp issues of fact on this issue, involving questions of credibility of witnesses, all of which were resolved against respondent. We cannot say that this holding is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record viewed as a whole. In Lakeland Bus Lines, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 278 F.2d 888, 892 (C.A.3), the court said: “An order directing reinstatement with back pay requires a good faith reinstatement.” The rule is the same in this circuit. N. L. R. B. v. Ellis & Watts Products, Inc., supra, 344 F.2d 67 (C.A.6); N. L. R. B. v. U. S. Air Con. Co., supra, 336 F.2d 275 (C.A.6). We have read the entire transcript of the supplemental proceedings before the Board on the issue of back pay award and hold that the findings of the Board rejecting all three of the cut-off dates relied upon by respondent are supported by substantial evidence. Enforcement of the supplemental order of the Board is granted.

provision for back pay and the usual notices. The other remedial provisions of the order, except as hereinafter mentioned, are also appropriate. The argument that an enforcement order cannot be given after there has been compliance is not well taken. Authority thoroughly establishes that compliance itself is not sufficient to deprive the Board of its right to secure enforcement to make sure that repetition of the unfair labor practices does not occur in the future. In any event, there is no showing of compliance here. An order directing reinstatement with back pay requires a good faith reinstatement. A rehiring and a subsequent firing because the rehired employee demands the back pay to which he is entitled is not a good faith reinstatement. Without going into the question of whether the Board may properly find a violation of 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (4) where the only wrongdoing shown is the discharge of an employee for insisting on receiving the back pay which the Board previously awarded him, we are not going to enforce the second order. The reason is that an order by this Court for Gibson’s reinstatement, back pay and the requisite notices will give him everything to which he is entitled. If the respondent does not obey this order in good faith it is in contempt, and the Court has ample power to take care of the situation. There is one final point in the case. Without any request from the General Counsel or any suggestion by the trial

The Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company (the “Railroad”) appeals from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. The district court entered summary judgment, enforcing an award of Public Law Board No. 1998 (the “Board”), in favor of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen (the “Brotherhood”), on behalf of railroad employee George L. Choate. After examining the briefs and reviewing the record, and based upon the oral argument before this court, we conclude that the district court, in entering its order, properly analyzed the issues raised in this appeal. Therefore, we affirm the district court’s order and judgment and hereby adopt its opinion entered on April 22, 1981, attached hereto as an appendix. Moreover, we add the following comments, relating in particular to the district court’s conclusions of law 543-544.
At the outset, we recognize, as did the district court, that the scope of judicial review in proceedings to enforce an award of the Public Law Board is among the narrowest in the law. Diamond v. Terminal Railway Alabama State Docks, 421 F.2d 228, 233 (5th Cir. 1970); see also Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Sheehan, 439 U.S. 89, 93, 99 S.Ct. 399, 401, 58 L.Ed.2d 354 (1978) (narrow scope of review applies to both questions of fact and questions of law). The Board’s order may be set aside only if the Board failed to comply with the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, failed to confine the order or itself to matters properly within the scope of its jurisdiction, or for fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the order. 45 U.S.C. § 153, First (p).
We find it anomalous that an employee can claim to be permanently and totally disabled, obtain a certification to that effect, and collect sickness and disability payments, and, at the same time, seek to force his employer to reinstate him to his former position with back pay for time lost. Cf. Hodges v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., 363 F.2d 534, 539 (5th Cir. 1966) (court “strongly disapprove^]” of practice which permitted employee to sue employer claiming permanent and total disability and at same time force employer to reinstate him to former position with back pay for time lost). Moreover, both the Public Law Board Award, as well as the district court’s opinion, are somewhat uncertain in that neither specifies what constitutes “time See, e.g., Monaghan v. Central Vermont Railway, Inc., 404 F.Supp. 683 (D.Mass.1975); Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Co., 284 F.Supp. 401 (N.D.Ill.1968). Nonetheless, we recognize that in light of the issues raised by the parties in the district court and the narrow scope of review under the Railway Labor Act, the district court was limited in what it could do. See, e.g., Denver & R.G.W. Ry. Co. v. Blackett, 538 F.2d 291, 294 (10th Cir. 1976) (district court had no power to allow set-off where Board had not provided for such allowance); cf. United States v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, 237 F.2d 137 (4th Cir. 1956) (whether equity of the railroad should be worked out by subrogation or by way of exoneration was a matter resting in the sound discretion of district judge). lost:
The Railroad relies on Sweeney v. Florida E.C. Ry. Co., 389 F.2d 113 (5th Cir. 1968), to support its contention that the district court had the authority to reduce the award by the amount Choate received during the period he was discharged. In Sweeney, the employee, for several years prior to his dismissal from the Florida East Coast Railway Co. (“FEC”), divided his working year, spending five months with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (“B & O”) and the balance of the year with the FEC. When Sweeney was discharged by the FEC, he went to work for the B & O. The Board sustained Sweeney’s wrongful dismissal claim, awarding him compensation for time lost, but the carrier did not pay. In the enforcement action which followed, the district court dismissed the action, holding that the dispute over whether the Board intended that the award be one of gross or net wages lost during the period must be resolved by the parties requesting the Board to interpret the award.
On appeal, the Fifth Circuit noted first that if the Board had intended the amount paid for “time lost” to be diminished by outside wages, it would have specified that in the award. Therefore, the court found that “Sweeney was entitled to the total amount of his ‘time lost’, without deductions . . . for other compensation received by him through his efforts to diminish or minimize the damages suffered by reason of his dismissal.’’ Id. at 116 (emphasis added). In view of the fact, however, that Sweeney had routinely worked for the B & 0 from June through October of each year and that his work during that period was “through his choice and not on account of his dismissal,” the Fifth Circuit diminished the award by the amount Sweeney earned for those five months at the B & 0. Id. at 116-17.
Sweeney is, in fact, quite consistent with the district court’s decision in this case. Like the court in Sweeney, we must assume that if the Board wanted the amount paid Choate reduced by his sickness benefits and disability annuity, it would have said so in the award. Moreover, unlike Sweeney, Choate received the payments not “through his choice,” but “on account of his dismissal.” Thus, the district court properly enforced the award which gave Choate his “time lost,” without deducting “other compensation received by him through his efforts to diminish or minimize the damages suffered by reason of his dismissal.”
Finally, as the Brotherhood conceded and the district court recognized, “Choate may ultimately be responsible for reimbursement to the Railroad Retirement Board at some point in the future.” After the Railroad complies with the terms of the award, the Retirement Board will have the option of seeking recovery from Choate for the sums it has paid him over the years. 45 U.S.C. §§ 231i(a), 362(o). Upon proper notice, the Retirement Board “shall have a lien” upon the judgment “to the extent of the amount [it] is entitled by way of reimbursement.” 45 U.S.C. § 362(o); Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., 237 F.2d at 140; United States v. Luquire Funeral Chapel, 199 F.2d 429 (5th Cir. 1952).
The order of the district court is affirmed.
APPENDIX
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS
Brotherhood Of Railroad ) Signalmen, ) Petitioner, ) ) -vs- ) ) Louisville And Nashville ) Railroad Company, ) ) Respondent. ) No. 80 5224
Before the Court are the motions of petitioner Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen (BRS) and of respondent Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company (L&N) for summary judgment. The instant action was brought pursuant to 45 U.S.C. Section 153, First (p) and Section 153, second, as a petition to enforce Award No. 1, Case No. 1 of Public Law Board No. 1998, dated January 24, 1978, sustaining the claim of the BRS against respondent L&N. Both parties presented oral arguments on their motions and stipulated in open court that the Court should render judgment on the record without submission of the case to a jury.
FINDINGS OF FACT
1. Petitioner Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen (hereinafter referred to as “BRS”) is the duly authorized representative for the purpose of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. Section 151 et seq.) of the employees of the respondent Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company (hereinafter referred to as “L&N”) in the positions of Signal Tester, Foreman, Assistant Foreman, Signal Technician, Leading Signalman, Leading Signal Maintainer, Assistant Signal Maintainer and Signal Helper and is a party to collective-bargaining agreements-executed pursuant to that statute governing rates of pay, rules and working conditions of those employees. The BRS main office is located at 601 West Golf Road in Mount Prospect, Illinois. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 4, Answer of L&N at paragraph 2.)
2. Respondent L&N is a Kentucky corporation engaged in interstate transportation by rail pursuant to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. Section 1 et seq. and is subject to the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. Section 151 et seq. Respondent maintains its main offices at 908 West Broadway, Louisville, Kentucky, and operates through the Southern District of Illinois. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 5; Answer of L&N at paragraph 2.)
3. BRS and the L&N are parties to a collective-bargaining agreement with an effective date of February 16, 1949, and parties to several successive supplemental and memorandum agreements. BRS and the L&N are also parties to an agreement dated July 14, 1977, which established Public Law Board No. 1998 pursuant to Section 3, Second of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. Section 153, Second) to hear and determine disputes between said parties in accordance with the provisions of that Section. This Agreement specified that the Board should have jurisdiction over disputes between the parties listed in Attachment A of the Agreement. A dispute between the parties arising out of the railroad’s dismissal from employment of Mr. G. L. Choate, identified as “Dismissal of Mr. G. L. Choate, Signal Tester Helper, following investigation held on July 16, 1976, Carrier file Nos. D-106-67, G-306-20, G-226-18. Organization Case No. 4921” is such a dispute listed in such Attachment A. (A true and correct copy of the July 14, 1977 Agreement and Attachment A thereto is attached to the Complaint of BRS as Exhibit B.) (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 6; Answer of L&N at paragraph 2.)
,.■4. G. L. Choate has been employed by respondent L&N for thirty-four years. He began service as a signal helper with the L&N on April 9, 1945, established seniority as an assistant signalman on March 24, 1948, and established seniority as a signalman on April 11, 1949. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 7; Answer of L&N at paragraph 2.)
5. Prior to July 16,1976, Mr. Choate was working on the L&N as a System Signal Tester Helper. He had been previously diagnosed as suffering from Meniere’s Syndrome, an ear disorder which affects his sense of balance and which makes it impossible for him to hold any position that entails pole climbing or any other duty that requires balancing. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 7); Answer of L&N at paragraph 2; Deposition of George L. Choate, December 29, 1980, at P. 29 (hereinafter referred to as “Tr. 29.”) ,
6. In addition to the regular rate of pay for the position of Signal System Tester Helper provided for in the BRS-L&N collective-bargaining agreement, Appendix DD of the Memorandum of Agreement between BRS and L&N of September 6, 1974, provided for the payment of $3.10 per day as a travel allowance to employees in the Signal Department occupying certain positions, of which Mr. Choate’s was one. This $3.10 per day was intended to be a flat rate reimbursement for employees off-the-job expenses, and was in addition to any other authorized expenses for lodging, meals or equipment necessary to perform the required tasks. (Tr. 16-18).
7. On July 16, 1976, the L&N held two consecutive discipline investigation hearings into its charges that Mr. Choate failed or refused to protect his assignment on June 21, 22, 29 and 30,1979, and was absent from duty without proper authority on those days. The investigations were conducted by H. L. Hood, the L&N’s Signal Engineer, Maintenance and Construction. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 10; Answer of L&N at paragraph 5; Tr. 23-24.)
8. By letter dated August 10, 1976, H. L. Hood notified Mr. Choate that he had been found guilty of the charges brought against him, and that the penalty to be assessed was dismissal from service. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 10; Answer of L&N at paragraph 5; Tr. 24.)
9. Pursuant to the application provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement and Section 3, First (i) of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. Section 151, First (i)) Mr. R.B. Flowers, the BRS representative acting on behalf of Mr. Choate, appealed the decision of H.L. Hood up to and including the highest officer of the L&N designated to entertain and act upon such appeals, Mr. W.C. Moore, the L&N Assistant Vice President-Personnel and Labor Relations. In its appeals of the decision, the BRS contended that Mr. Hood’s decision and the subsequent dismissal of Mr. Choate were invalid due to the unfairness of the proceedings as conducted by Mr. Hood. By letter dated October 1, 1976, W.C. Moore denied the appeal. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraphs 11 and 12; Answer of L&N at paragraph 5.)
10. Following conferences between representatives of the BRS and the L&N held on November 19, 1976, and December 13, 1976, the L&N offered to restore Mr. Choate to service on a leniency basis, restoring his former seniority but without pay for the time lost due to his dismissal. This offer was conditioned upon Mr. Choate’s ability to satisfactorily pass a physical examination. By letter dated January 24, 1977, R.B. Flowers advised the L&N that the BRS refused to accept the offer of Mr. Choate’s reinstatement on a leniency basis because Rule 55(a)(3) of the collective-bargaining agreement required that Mr. Choate be reinstated with all rights unimpaired and with pay for all time lost due to the invalidity of the dismissal decision. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 12; Answer of L&N at paragraph 5.)
11. Rule 55(a)(3) of the BRS-L&N collective-bargaining agreement provides as follows:
“If the charge or charges against the employee are not sustained, his record shall be cleared of the charge or charges and if suspended or dismissed he shall be reinstated with all rights unimpaired and paid for time lost.”
(See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 12; Answer of L&N at paragraph 5.)
12. Following the L&N’s refusal to change its position with respect to Mr. Choate’s dismissal, the BRS presented his claim to Public Law Board No. 1998. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 13; Answer of L&N at paragraph 5, Tr. 25-26).
13. On January 24, 1978, Neutral Member I.M. Lieberman issued the Award No. 1 of Public Law Board No. 1998. That Award sustained the claim of the BRS on behalf of Mr. G.L. Choate. The Board sustained BRS’s allegations of unfairness and impropriety in the hearing officer’s conduct of the investigation and hearing in his refusal to allow Mr. Choate to explain his absence or to present evidence in litigation. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 14-15; Answer of L&N at paragraph 5; Tr. 26-27); Award No. 1, Case No. 1, Pub.L.Bd.No. 1998, a copy of which is attached to the complaint as Appendix A, Exhibit 1, at pp. 3-6 (hereinafter referred to as “Award No. 1”.)
14. Award No. 1 included an Order that the L&N comply with the Award, i.e., thirty (30) days from the date of the Award of January 24, 1978. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 18; Answer of L&N at paragraph 8; Award No. 1 at paragraph 6.)
15. The L&N did not comply with the terms of Award No. 1 by the thirty-first (31) day after it was issued. On that date, February 24, 1978, BRS General Chairman R.B. Flowers requested by letter that the L&N advise BRS when it would honor the provisions of Award No. 1, Case No. 1 of Public Law Board No. 1998. Mr. Flowers’ letter reminded the L&N that Rule 55(a)(3) states that:
“If the charge or charges against an employee are not sustained his record shall be cleared of the charge or charges and if suspended or dismissed he shall be reinstated with all rights unimpaired and paid for time lost.”
(See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 19; Answer of L&N at paragraph 8.)
16. In a letter dated March 23,1978, J.P. Powell, the L&N Superintendent-Signals ordered Mr. Choate to report to Signal Tester R.E. Harvill at Dickson, Tennessee, several hundred miles from Mr. Choate’s home in Belleville, Illinois, on Tuesday, March 28, 1978. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 20; Answer of L&N at paragraph 8.)
17. On March 27, 1978, Mr. Choate received a telephone call from Mr. Powell’s office informing him that it would be futile for him to make the journey to Dickson, Tennessee because the position for which he was being ordered to report was in reality unavailable to him. Although the telephone call was placed to Mr. Choate by Mr. Flowers, this was done at the request of Mr. Powell and in his presence. (See Tr. 46^47, 57.)
18. Following the L&N’s advice that his return to service would be a useless gesture, in that telephone call from Mr. Powell’s office, Mr. Choate requested a six month leave of absence pursuant to Rule 36 of the collective-bargaining agreement, on April 1, 1978. That request was granted on April 7, 1978. By letter dated September 30, 1978, Mr. Choate requested a six month extension of his leave of absence, which was granted on October 5, 1978. {See Complaint of BRS at Paragraph 23; Answer of L&N at paragraph 11; Tr. 48.)
19. By letter dated August 30, 1978, BRS requested an interpretation of Award No. 1. In that interpretation, the majority of the Board indicated that its intent in sustaining the claim of G.L. Choate was that the L&N comply fully with the provisions of Rule 55 with respect to Mr. Choate as the remedy in the dispute. In that interpretation, the Board restated that the pertinent provisions of Rule 55 are as follows:
If the charge or charges against an employee are not sustained, his record shall be cleared of the charge or charges and if suspended or dismissal he shall be reinstated with all rights unimpaired and paid for time lost.
(See Interpretation No. 1 of Award No. 1, Case No. 1, a copy of which is attached to the complaint as Appendix C.)
20. On July 16, 1976, the date of the initial hearings which ultimately resulted in his dismissal from service, Mr. Choate was physically qualified to perform the job of System Signal Tester Helper on the L&N. Although he was suffering from Meniere’s Syndrome at the time, that only prevented him from performing jobs that involved climbing poles. However, the System Signal Tester Helper position required no pole climbing, and merely required the occupant of the position to accompany the tester to the locations of the signals, to transcribe the tests made by the tester pursuant to the Signal Inspection Act and the requirements of the Federal Railroad Administration, and to forward the results of those tests to the appropriate management personnel. (See Tr. 12-13, 29, 55.)
21. Mr. Choate’s fitness to return to the System Signal Tester Helper position to which he was entitled under Award No. 1 and Rule 55 of the collective-bargaining agreement was certified by Dr. T. O’Brien of Belleville, Illinois, to whom Mr. Choate had been referred by the L&N following Mr. Choate’s fall in the parking lot of the motel at which the July 16 investigative hearings took place. (See Tr. 31-32, 57.)
22. Mr. Choate has been receiving Occupational Disability and Annuity payments from the Railroad Retirement Board since 1978. He is suffering from Meniere’s Syndrome. He has, however, been found by L&N’s physician to be fit to return to his position as a System Signal Helper Position of which only six positions were available on the L&N system. (See Tr. 34, 36-37, 42, 43.)
23. Mr. Choate has not held any other employment since his dismissal from the L&N following the July 16, 1976 hearings, although he has contacted numerous other carriers for the purpose of seeking employment. (See Tr. 44-46.)
24. Mr. Choate is not totally disabled at this time. His disability has always been, and continues to be, only with relation to the jobs in the Signal Department as to which he has seniority rights, but which involve climbing poles or performing other similar tasks. (See Tr. 43.)
25. As of December 29, 1980, Mr. Choate considered himself to be physically qualified to perform the job of System Signal Tester Helper on the L&N. (See Tr. 59.)
26. The L&N has not complied with Award No. 1 by restoring Mr. Choate to a position, with pay for time lost and a restoration of all rights unimpaired. (See Tr. 60.)
27. Under Section 3 of the Railway Labor Act, a United States District Court is empowered to enforce awards of divisions of the National Railroad Adjustment Board, or a Special Adjustment Board (Public Law Board.) Such Awards may be set aside only in three (3) very limited circumstances, specifically enunciated in the Railway Labor Act:
Failure of the division to comply with the provisions of this chapter, for failure of the order to conform or confine itself, to matters within the scope of the division’s jurisdiction, or for fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the order. 45 U.S.C. Section 153, First (p).
(See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 27; Answer of L&N at paragraph 25.)
28. It is also admitted that Public Law Board No. 1998 has complied with all of the relevant provisions of the statutory chapter referred to in Section 3, First (p) of the Railway Labor Act. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 28; Answer of L&N at paragraph 15.)
29. It is also admitted that Public Law Board No. 1998 in Award No. 1, Case No. 1, confined itself to matters within its jurisdiction by disposing of certain claims and grievances as listed in Appendix A of the July 14, 1977, agreement. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 29; Answer of L&N at paragraph 15.)
30. It is admitted that there existed no fraud or corruption by any member of the Board making the Order. (See Complaint of BRS at paragraph 30; Answer of L&N at paragraph 15.)
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. Section 3, First (p) and Section 3, Second of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. Section 153, First (p) and Second) require that this Court enforce the awards of Public Law Boards unless the Board has failed to comply with the requirements of that Act, the Board has exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction, or there has been some fraud or corruption on the part of members of the Board. This Court may set aside Award No. 1 of Public Law Board No. 1998, then, only if one of those three statutory factors is presented.
2. Courts construing these enforcement provisions have repeatedly emphasized the strict limitations on the review powers of the district courts. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has concluded that the scope of review by Federal District Courts in proceedings to enforce an award of a Public Law Board is among the narrowest in the law. Diamond v. Terminal Railway Alabama State Docks, 421 F.2d 228 (5th Cir. 1970.)
3. The United States Supreme Court has recently emphasized that this extremely narrow scope of review applies to both questions of fact and questions of law, in Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Sheehan, 439 U.S. 89, 99 S.Ct. 399, 58 L.Ed.2d 354 (1978), where the Court stated as follows:
“Characterizing the issue presented as one of law, as the Court of Appeals seemed to do here, does not alter the availability or scope of judicial review: The dispositive question is whether the party’s objections to the Adjustment Board’s decision fall within any of the three limited categories of review provided for in the Railway Labor Act. Section 153, First (q) unequivocally states that the ‘findings and order of the (Adjustment Board) shall be conclusive on the parties’ and may be set aside only for the three reasons specified therein. We have time and again emphasized that this statutory language means just what it says. See, e.g., Gunther v. San Diego & A.E.R. Co., 382 U.S. 257, 263 [86 S.Ct. 368, 371, 15 L.Ed.2d 308] (1965)
Id. at 93, 99 S.Ct. at 401.
4. The history of judicial interpretations of dispute resolution, enforcement and review provisions of the Railway Labor Act, is replete with instances of confirmation of the limited role of Courts in the resolution of minor disputes under the Railway Labor Act. See Andrews v. Louisville and Nash ville Railroad Co., 406 U.S. 320, 92 S.Ct. 1562, 32 L.Ed.2d 95 (1972); Gunther v. San Diego and Arizona Eastern Ry. Co., 382 U.S. 257, 86 S.Ct. 368, 15 L.Ed.2d 308 (1965); Denver and Rio Grande R.R. v. Blackett, 538 F.2d 291 (10th Cir. 1976).
5. Inasmuch as there is no allegation that Public Law Board No. 1998 has failed to comply with the requirements of the relevant provisions of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. Section 151 et seq, that the Board has exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction, or that any member of that Board is guilty of fraud or corruption, Award No. 1 of Public Law Board No. 1998 must now be enforced, and the L&N ordered to comply therewith. 45 U.S.C. Section 153, First (p) and Second. See Sheehan, 439 U.S. at 93, 99 S.Ct. at 401; Gunther, 382 U.S. at 263-264, 86 S.Ct. at 371-372.
6. Courts reviewing questions of an employer’s compliance with reinstatement or backpay awards have ruled that such awards require good faith compliance with the terms thereof. N.L.R.B. v. Interurban Gas Co., 354 F.2d 76, 78 (6th Cir. 1965); Lakeland Bus Lines, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 278 F.2d 888, 892 (3d Cir. 1960). We cannot find that a restoration to seniority status is compliance with Award No. 1. G.L. Choate must be restored to a job and given back pay in order for there to be compliance with the award.
7. The offer of the L&N to reinstate G. L. Choate was a sham offer of reinstatement. Subsequently the L&N attempted to tout that sham as compliance with the terms of a reinstatement plus back pay award. Brown v. Bridgeport Rolling Mills Company, 59 L.R.R.M. 2773 (D.C.Conn. 1965).
