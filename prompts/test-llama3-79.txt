In the case at hand, the plaintiff, Jerry R. Wilson, a school teacher, is suing the Pleasant Hill School District, the Board of Education, and the superintendent for allegedly violating his constitutionally-protected rights to free speech and association, as well as his right to due process of law. The plaintiff claims that his contract was not renewed due to his activities in teacher associations, rather than the reasons given by the Board.

In Monroe v. Pape (1961), the Supreme Court held that a suit lies against individual defendants, even if they are acting in their official capacities, as long as the injury is not caused by their official duties. However, in this case, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that his contract was not renewed due to his activities in teacher associations. The evidence presented by the defendants shows that the decision not to rehire the plaintiff was based on his performance as a teacher and his personal conduct, rather than his association activities.

Furthermore, the case of Monroe v. Pape does not apply to this case, as the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the injury was not caused by the official duties of the defendants. In fact, the evidence presented by the defendants shows that they were acting in their official capacities and that their decision not to rehire the plaintiff was based on their official duties.

In conclusion, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that his contract was not renewed due to his activities in teacher associations, and the case of Monroe v. Pape does not apply to this case. Therefore, the plaintiff's claim that his contract was not renewed due to his activities in teacher associations is without merit.

Prior to the trial of this action, in their motion to dismiss, defendants raised the following contentions, inter alia: that the National Education Association lacked standing to bring this action; that Pleasant Hill School District R-III is not a “person” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and that the members of the Board of Education are not amenable to suit either in their individual or official capacities.

the defendants from thereafter terminating his employment by reason of activities protected by the federal constitution. He also prayed for a judgment for $25,000 in damages resulting from “family disruption, inconvenience, damage to reputation, inability to find other employment, [and] physical, mental and emotional suffering.” Defendants premised their motion to dismiss on (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter by reason of state immunity under the Eleventh Amendment; (2) failure of the complaint to state a claim for relief. In its unreported order denying the motion the District Court refrained from specific discussion of the Eleventh Amendment issue. It found that jurisdiction existed for the reason that (a) Arkansas A & M College, organized pursuant to Sections 80-3101 — 80-3102, Ark.Stat.Ann., is a body “politic” and as such may sue and be sued as a legal entity; (b) the Civil Rights Statutes, 28 U.S.C. § 1343(3) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 explicitly confer jurisdiction; (c) the complaint alleges diversity of citizenship and the requisite jurisdictional amount under 28 U.S.C. § 1332; (d) there exists a federal question under the privileges and immunities and due process clauses of the Constitution, 28 U.S.C. § 1331. In concluding that the complaint also asserted a claim for relief the Court, 270 F.Supp. 528 stated: “In accordance with a policy decision made by the Board of Trustees of Arkansas A & M College at its scheduled meeting on October 28, 1965, you are hereby dismissed from the faculty of Arkansas A & M College,

and is not questioned. Plaintiff Smith is a Negro. He taught high school science in Morrilton and was dismissed as hereinafter described. The corporate plaintiff, The Arkansas Teachers Association, Inc., is a non-profit Arkansas corporation with a membership of about 3400 negro teachers in the State. ATA is apparently authorized to engage in litigation for the protection of its members. The defendants coupled their answer with a motion to dismiss as to ATA on the ground that it is neither a real party in interest, Rule 17(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., nor a member of a class on behalf of which relief is sought, Rule 23(a), and to dismiss as to Smith for the same reasons so far as he purports to act on behalf of negro pupils, and, so far as he purports to act for other teachers, on the grounds that the class is not so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable and that his interest is adverse to all others in the class. The background facts. Until September 1965 teachers and pupils in the Morrilton school system were fully segregated by race. Some demands for desegregation were first made in January of that year. The system serves about 1750 white pupils and about 360 Negroes. There were four elementary schools, one negro and three white, and two junior-senior high schools, one white and one negro. The negro school, covering grades seven through twelve, was known as the L. V. Sullivan High School and had about 166 pupils. The

on all other factual issues. Because of the unwillingness expressed at the voir dire examination by two veniremen to assess monetary damages against the defendants as individuals, plaintiffs dismissed the complaint as to the defendants in their individual capacities. Thus the suit proceeded against the trustees and the superintendent as defendants only in their representative capacities. The suit also proceeded against the school district. During the trial and after the defendants in their individual capacities had been dismissed, the applicability of Monroe v. Pape, supra, to the question whether a cause of action was stated was drawn into issue. Put differently, would a suit lie against defendants as being “persons” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983? The jurisdictional statute, § 1343(3), supra, is to accommodate suits otherwise authorized by law, here under § 1983. Defendants moved to dismiss on this basis and the motion was carried with the case. The case was submitted to the jury on special interrogatories. The jury returned a verdict finding that the decision not to rehire the plaintiffs was made without regard to their race, and that defendants acted in good faith, objectively comparing the qualifications of all teachers. However, the jury found that participation in this litigation was a factor in the decision not to offer re-employment to seven of the plaintiffs. At this juncture, the district court granted the motion to dismiss. The court determined that plaintiffs had failed to state a cause of action under § 1983, relying on Monroe

ELMO B. HUNTER, District Judge.
This is an action brought pursuant to the provisions of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983 (The Civil Rights Acts) seeking declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and damages for an alleged violation of plaintiff Jerry R. Wilson’s constitutionally-protected rights to free speech and association, and due process of law. Jurisdiction is founded upon the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 1343(3) and (4).
The individual plaintiff, Jerry R. Wilson, is a school teacher formerly employed by defendant Pleasant Hill School District R-III. Plaintiff National Education Association is a national teacher’s organization of which plaintiff Wilson is a member. Defendant Pleasant Hill School District R-III is a public school district organized and existing under the laws of the State of Missouri; defendant Hall is the superintendent of Pleasant Hill School District; and defendants Ingels, Alexander, Hayes, Palmer, Manda, and Carlile were the elected and acting members of the Board of Education of Pleasant Hill School District at the time of the events mentioned in plaintiffs’ complaint.
Plaintiff Wilson had been employed by the Pleasant Hill School District for six years. His last employment by the District was as an industrial arts teacher under a one year written contract for the 1969-1970 school year. In the Spring of 1970, on or about April 14, 1970, plaintiff received a letter from the Board of Education which advised plaintiff that he had not been reemployed by the District for the 1970-1971 school year. The reasons given in the notification for plaintiff’s nonreemployment were (1) “Effectiveness as a teacher is declining rather than improving,” and (2) “Employment was not recommended by the school administration.”
Prior to his nonreemployment as a teacher in the Pleasant Hill School District, plaintiff Wilson had been active in various teacher organizations affiliated with the plaintiff National Education Association, including the Missouri State Teacher’s Association, the Pleasant Hill Community Teacher’s Association, the Suburban Kansas City Education Association, and the Missouri Asso ciation of Classroom Teachers. In the school year of 1968-69, plaintiff was the president of the Suburban Kansas City Education Association, and, in the preceding year, plaintiff had been the president of the Pleasant Hill Community Teacher’s Association. In his last year as a teacher in the Pleasant Hill School District, plaintiff was the welfare chairman of the Pleasant Hill Community Teacher’s Association.
It is plaintiff’s contention that plaintiff Wilson’s contract was not renewed by the Board for the 1970-71 school year because of his activities in the above-mentioned teacher associations, rather than for the reasons given in the Board’s notification or for any other permissible reason. As a result of this alleged action on the part of the Board, plaintiffs contend that the defendants violated plaintiff Wilson’s constitutionally-protected rights to freedom of speech and association. Plaintiffs also allege that the failure of the Board to provide plaintiff with specific reasons for his nonreemployment and with a hearing violated his fourteenth amendment right to due process of law. Conversely, defendants urge that Wilson was not given a teaching contract for the 1970-71 school year solely for reasons other than his activities in teacher’s associations. Defendants also contend that they were not required to provide Wilson either with a hearing in the matter, or with any further reasons for his nonreemployment other than those set forth in the written notification.
In Missouri, at the time of the Board’s notification to Wilson that his contract would not be renewed, the Board’s right not to rehire a teacher in the school district was absolute, except that the decision not to rehire could not be based upon grounds violative of that teacher’s constitutionally-protected or other legal rights. See: Freeman v. Gould Special School District of Lincoln County, Arkansas, 405 F.2d 1153, 1158 (8th Cir. 1969), cert. den. 396 U.S. 843, 90 S.Ct. 61, 24 L.Ed.2d 93 (1969); Williams v. School District of Springfield R-12, 447 S.W.2d 256, 265 (Mo.1969).
During the trial of this cause conflicting evidence was adduced by both sides regarding many of the important aspects of the case, including the testimony which concerns the reasons for defendants Hubey Hall, superintendent of schools; Jack Forbes, assistant superintendent and former high school principal; and James Neal, principal of the high school, separately, and apparently independently, recommending to the Board of Education that plaintiff not be reemployed and that he be given the required notice of nonreemployment. However, the defendants credibly demonstrated numerous permissible reasons for the Board’s action in not renewing the plaintiff’s contract for the 1970-71 school year. For example, Superintendent Hall testified that, at approximately the beginning of the school year, plaintiff Wilson refused to collect tickets for a coming football game as requested by Hall, and that following the request Wilson abruptly walked out of Hall’s office. Other evidence indicates that Wilson actually did collect tickets at the football game following the later request of another school official. The incident, among others, reveals the personality differences existing between plaintiff and his school superintendent. In addition, it was the belief of both Superintendent Hall and Assistant Superintendent Forbes, although based to some extent on conjecture, but also supported by evidence, that plaintiff was permitting nonstudents to use the workroom and school equipment under his charge on Saturdays, Sundays, and on week nights and that he was failing to account sufficiently to the administrative officials for the cost of the school materials used by those persons and to obtain permission • from school officials for this type of use. Assistant Superintendent Forbes was of the opinion that plaintiff unreasonably interrupted faculty meetings, usually for trivial matters or matters which were not scheduled for discussion as a part of the agenda then under consideration. Furthermore, it is undisputed that plaintiff, although certified as a teacher in Industrial Arts, Junior High English, and Driver’s Education, and while teaching his Industrial Arts class, without permission invited in speakers and sponsored five one-hour sessions on evolution. It is also undisputed that these sessions on evolution were not within the scope of the industrial arts class materials.
The above-mentioned incidents are but some of the examples given by the defendants as a basis for their nonreemployment of the plaintiff. Furthermore, it was the explicit and positive evidence of the defendants that the discharge of plaintiff Wilson was not, in any way, related to his Pleasant Hill Teacher’s Association activities or to any other teachers’ association activities. Rather, Superintendent Hall testified in detail as to his support for teachers’ associations for many years and his belief that strong membership in these teachers’ associations, including the Pleasant Hill Community Teacher's Association was beneficial and important. This testimony was substantially corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses. In lesser detail, similar credible testimony and evidence was adduced on behalf of defendants Forbes and Neal.
In view of the testimony and evidence in this case taken as a whole plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden of proof in that they have failed to persuade the Court that the true reason for Wilson’s nonreemployment was based upon his activities in teachers’ associations or any other exercise of his constitutionally-protected rights. Thus, plaintiffs’ contention that Wilson’s nonreemployment was violative of his right to free speech and association is without merit.
There remains for disposition plaintiffs’ contention that Wilson was denied procedural due process in that he was not afforded a hearing by the Board or specific reasons for his nonreemployment. In Freeman v. Gould Special School District of Lincoln County, Arkansas, supra, 405 F.2d at pages 1160-1161, the Eighth Court of Appeals recently stated:
“[PJlaintiffs * * * project that the Board must accord due process, both substantive and procedural, in all of its operative procedures. If this were so, we would have little need of tenure or merit laws as there could only be, as argued by the plaintiffs, a discharge for cause, with the school board carrying the burden of showing that the discharge was for a permissible reason. We do not believe this to be the law, as there are many public employees who are separated from their employment by a purely arbitrary decision, upon a change of administration or even a change of factual control where the appointments are not protected by civil service or some type of tenure, statutory or contractual.
* * * * * *
“Absent statutory or contractual requirements, persons discharged for inefficiency, incompetency, or insubordination have no constitutional right to a hearing with rights of cross-examination and confrontation of witnesses.” See also: Schultz v. Palmberg, 317 F.Supp. 659 (D.Wyo.1970) ; Bonner v. Texas City Independent School District of Texas, 305 F.Supp. 600 (S.D.Tex.1969); Morey v. Inde pendent School District #492, 312 F. Supp. 1257, 1262 (D.Minn.1969).
At the time Wilson was notified by the Board of his nonreemployment, Missouri’s new “Teacher Tenure Act” was not in effect. And, it is undisputed by the parties that the Board did provide Wilson with written notification of his nonreemployment in accordance with the provisions of Mo.Rev.Stat. § 168.111, V. A.M.S. Thus, the Board properly complied with the only existing statutory requirement relating to the nonreemployment of a Missouri teacher. Williams v. School District of Springfield R-12, supra. Plaintiff Wilson therefore was not denied any right to procedural due process.
Accordingly, for the reasons stated, above, judgment is hereby granted in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiffs.
It is so ordered.
