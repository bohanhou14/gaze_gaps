In the case at hand, the plaintiff, Scott, is suing the defendants, Hire, for allegedly infringing on her copyrighted play, "Discretion". The plaintiff claims that the defendants' play, "Conditional Surrender", is a copy of her original work.

To establish copyright infringement, the plaintiff must prove that the defendants' play was copied from her copyrighted work and that the defendants unlawfully appropriated protected material from her work. The plaintiff argues that there are similarities between the two plays, including similar plots, characters, and settings.

However, the defendants argue that the similarities are not sufficient to establish copyright infringement. They point out that the plays are significantly different in terms of sequence, characterization, characters, scenes, settings, and style of writing.

The District Court found that the two plays are "two entirely different plays" and that there is no evidence or proof of direct access or even the possibility of access to the plaintiff's play by the author or producers of "Conditional Surrender".

In this case, the plaintiff's claim is similar to the case of 153 F.2d 893, where the court found that the defendant's work was not a copy of the plaintiff's work, but rather an independent creation. The court also noted that the doctrine of unconscious plagiarism is not applicable in this case.

Additionally, the plaintiff's claim is also similar to the case of 154 F.2d 480, where the court found that the similarity between the two works was not sufficient to establish copyright infringement. The court noted that the similarity was due to the use of a common source and that the works were not substantially similar.

In conclusion, based on the evidence presented, it appears that the defendants' play "Conditional Surrender" is not a copy of the plaintiff's copyrighted play "Discretion". The District Court's finding that the two plays are "two entirely different plays" and that there is no evidence or proof of direct access or even the possibility of access to the plaintiff's play by the author or producers of "Conditional Surrender" supports this conclusion.

was direct evidence that it had had no access thereto, but the court found from comparison of the book with the picture that there were similarities which could not be the result of coincidence and which, therefore, were the result of access to the book by defendant and of “conscious or unconscious” copying thereof. It recognized as the parties here agree, that in law the unauthorized copying of the whole or substantial part of the literary property of another is a tort and that in an action such as this the burden of proof to establish the commission of the tort was upon plaintiff. Also that the law of literary property and copyright, differing from patent law, protects the property right of the originator of a composition, even though the composition he has originated is the same as that which another has originated. Each originator has property right in his own and the action does not lie unless the defendant had access to the plaintiff’s work and copied therefrom. But as summarized in its written opinion, included in the record, the court inferred from the existence of similarities which it found “that this is a -case where plaintiff’s treatment has been consciously or unconsciously purloined.” The defendant prosecutes this appeal to reverse the decree and contends, among other things, (1) that the court erroneously applied the doctrine of unconscious plagiarism and that upon proper application of the law relating to access and copying to the evidence before the court, the

copied from plaintiff’s work, and (b) that, if copying is proved, it was so “material” or “substantial” as to constitute unlawful appropriation. Plaintiff here must lose for failure to establish the first of these facts. The evidence by no means compels the conclusion that there was access; on the other hand, it does not compel the conclusion that there was not. Consequently, copying might still be proved by showing striking similarity. Here similarity exists; indeed, a passage in Franchelti’s “verse” is identical with one in plaintiff’s “chorus.” Mere similarity is not enough; but here one finds more; both to the eye and ear, the identity is unmistakable, as defendants virtually concede. But defendants explain this fact by saying that, quite independently, both composers utilized a common source — either Dvorak’s composition or the older commonplace theme which Dvorak had adopted and adapted. As, however, both optically and aurally, plaintiff’s treatment is distinguishable from Dvorak’s and also from the older commonplace theme, that explanation would not wash, were plaintiff’s -contribution highly original. In an appropriate case, copying might be demonstrated, with no proof or weak proof of access, by showing that a single brief phrase, contained in both pieces, was so idiosyncratic- in its treatment as to preclude coincidence. In such circumstances, stimulation by the same stimulus would not serve as a defense: Buchanan tells us that Kekulé’s “idea of the carbon-ring came out of the lurid imagery of a morning after a party”; many a chemist had had a like

This suit for damages and injunctive relief was brought by the plaintiff for the alleged infringement by defendants of a copyright owned by her.
Plaintiff Scott testified that when she wrote “Discretion” in 1939, she was a housewife living in Grand Rapids, Michigan ; that she wrote it as a one-act radio play as a pilot for a proposed radio series, but that “Discretion” was never broadcast as a radio play. She testified further that in 1944, after many hours of drafting and rewriting, she expanded “Discretion” into a two and a half hour three-act play. This is the play which was copyrighted by plaintiff in 1944, and with a few brief additions, was presented by an amateur group in Detroit, Michigan, for two performances in 1946.
The play “Discretion” has never been published, publicly circulated or professionally produced. The validity of plaintiff’s copyright is not contested.
Up to the time of the alleged infringing telecast in 1962, plaintiff had made fifteen copies of her work some of which she still had on hand. She had circulated her work among several business agents, but without success.
Mrs. Lois Hire is the author of the allegedly infringing play “Conditional Surrender.” It is a half hour TV show which was telecast on May 9, 1962 by National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and station WKJG, Inc. in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in presenting “The Loretta Young Show.” Mrs. Hire testified she wrote “Conditional Surrender” in 1960 in California, and that it was based upon an idea given to her by the instructor of an adult TY play-writing class which she attended from 1958 to 1960. She testified she completed the play in a five day, twenty hour period.
Mrs. Hire is a professional writer. She has written twelve plays of which seven have been sold and produced on nationally televised productions such as “Bonanza”, “U. S. Steel Hour”, “Kentucky Jones” and “The Loretta Young Show.”
Mrs. Hire testified she had never known of plaintiff’s play nor of the plaintiff until the instant suit was commenced. She testified that she had never been in the State of Michigan, and that prior to 1958, she had had no particular interest in plays or play-writing and had never read any unpublished scripts.
There are similarities in the two plays here involved. Both have the same general stock plot, for each play involves a husband, wife and husband’s girl friend situation. It cannot be said that the love triangle plot is, in itself, unique.
Involved in each play is a middle-aged couple having been married for about fifteen years. They have reached a crisis resulting from the husband’s involvement with a woman who works in his place of business. In each play the wife apparently accedes to the husband’s request for a divorce, but does so in a manner to show to him the disadvantages of such a situation. The wife’s terms and her other actions are, in fact, devices by which the wife seeks to defeat her husband’s plans for a divorce. In both plays the wife’s devices include the requirement that the husband assume the custody of the children, and purchase the wife’s interest in the home property.
Also involved in each play is the wife’s acquisition of new clothes as a means of attracting men when the wife goes on a hunt for a new husband. There is a further similarity in that the wardrobe suggested by the wife in each case was daring and rather shocking to the husband.
Plaintiff points to certain words and groups of words which, she argues, demonstrate a copying by the defendant. With reference to the suggested divorce, the wife in defendant’s play states “Since it has, there’s no point in being uncivilized about it. * * The wife in plaintiff’s play states “ * * * We’re two civilized people. * * * ” Again, the wife in defendant’s play says “ * * I’ll line them up and say ‘Boys, your father has found a new playmate’ ” while the wife in plaintiff’s play states “ * * The King is dead — long live the King.”
Plaintiff also points to the use of the word “brazen.” The husband in defendant’s play states “I certainly didn’t expect this brazen man hunt.” In the plaintiff’s play the husband states “You sound brazen.”
Plaintiff refers to a grammatical error, the alleged use of “I’d” as a contraction for “I had.” However, the use of “I’d” in defendant’s “Conditional Surrender” was not a contraction for “I had.”
Plaintiff makes references to some additional groups of words called by her “key words,” and also additional sentences used in defendant’s play which plaintiff claims indicate copying. However, the District Court found that there were no identical or copied word for word sentences or passages in the two plays.
The trial court also found the two plays were so significantly different as to sequence, characterization, characters, scenes, settings and style of writing as to be “two entirely different plays.”
In addition, the District Court found there was no evidence or proof of direct access or even the possibility of access to the plaintiff’s play by the author or producers of “Conditional Surrender.”
A copyright is intended to protect authorship. The essence of a copyright protection is the protection of originality rather than novelty or invention. Wihtol v. Wells, 7 Cir., 231 F.2d 550.
It must be remembered that copyright protection does not extend to ideas, plots, dramatic situations and events. Rather, it is limited to the arrangement of words the author uses to express his ideas. Funkhouser v. Loew’s, Inc., 8 Cir., 208 F.2d 185, 189, cert. den. 348 U.S. 843, 75 S.Ct. 64, 99 L.Ed. 664; Burnett v. Lambino, S.D.N.Y., 204 F.Supp. 327, 331-332.
To establish the infringement of a copyright, the plaintiff has the burden of proving 1) that the accused work was copied from the copyrighted work, and 2) that the author of the accused work unlawfully appropriated protected material from the copyrighted work. Arnstein v. Porter, 2 Cir., 154 F.2d 464, 468.
