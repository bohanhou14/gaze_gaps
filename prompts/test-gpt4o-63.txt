In analyzing whether Gordin's actions constituted an attempt to transport without filing a report, it is pertinent to consider the "substantial step" doctrine outlined in United States v. Martinez, 775 F.2d 31. The doctrine establishes that an overt action that strongly corroborates intent qualifies as a substantial step towards the commission of the offense. Here, Gordin's actions in withdrawing $500,000, purchasing tickets, and preparing to board a flight to Helsinki constitute such a step.

Moreover, cases like United States v. Coplon, 185 F.2d 629, emphasize that conduct crossing beyond mere preparation and exhibiting a firm intention to complete the crime qualifies as an attempt. Gordin's pattern of past transactions and demonstrated knowledge of the legal requirement further supports this view.

Additionally, the interpretation in United States v. Bareno-Burgos, 739 F.Supp. 772, clarifies that the duty to file can be triggered well before actual departure, upholding the notion that significant preparatory actions can meet the "about to transport" criterion.

Finally, the concept of "attempted transactions" in United States v. Jenkins, 943 F.2d 167, which was reversed on other grounds, underscores that intent and significant preparatory actions can satisfy legal thresholds for attempts. Given these precedents, Gordin's actions align with the definition of attempted transport in violation of §§ 5316 and 5324(b), thus justifying the seizure and forfeiture under § 5317(c).

To have attempted that transaction, more than mere planning is required. There must have been a substantial step, an overt act, furthering the intended activity. An attempt occurs when one “sufficiently manifested [his] intent to commit a particular substantive offense yet failed to consummate the crime.” United States v.

York on August 1 and, after a six to eight hour lay-over in Belgium, arrive in Zaire on August 3. Washington also booked Jenkins on a flight that would return to New York on August 9. Further details of the plan were discussed when Jenkins and Maniquis again met on July 25th. Jenkins now identified the Afro-American Bank as the institution in which Maniquis’ money would be deposited and revealed that he controlled fifty percent of the bank’s stock. Jenkins again guaranteed that Maniquis’ money would not be at risk and that he could reclaim it whenever he desired. Further, Jenkins continued to assure Maniquis that he would be able to carry the $150,000 into Zaire without any difficulties. At this point, referring to the federal statute prohibiting the transportation of more than $10,000 outside the United States without filing a Currency or Monetary Instrument Report (“CMIR”), see 31 U.S.C. § 5316(a), Mani-quis asked Jenkins what he intended to do about the “Customs form you’re supposed to fill out, if you’re bringing a certain amount of money out of the [United States].” Jenkins was apparently unaware of the requirement and told Maniquis that he would “check that out.” On July 31, the day before Jenkins was scheduled to depart for Zaire, he and Mani-quis had yet another meeting. Jenkins now showed Maniquis the Afro-American Bank’s charter, the minutes of an incorporation meeting and a document demonstrating that the bank already had substantial funds on deposit. The conversation eventually turned to

at or near the place contemplated for its commission, where such possession . . . serves no lawful purpose ...” under the subtitle “Conduct Which May Be Held Substantial Step Under Subsection (l)(c).” Application of the foregoing to the instant case emphasizes the importance of a rule encouraging early police intervention where a suspect is clearly bent on the commission of crime. The undisputed testimony of Campbell and Young established that appellants intended to execute a successful bank robbery. Moreover, Stallworth and Sellers, in furtherance of their plan, took substantial steps that strongly corroborated their criminal intent. They reconnoitered the bank, discussed (on tape) their plan of attack, armed themselves and stole ski masks and surgical gloves. The getaway car was carefully prepared for destruction. As Sellers moved ominously toward the bank and Campbell uttered a verbal signal to his accomplices, a bank robbery was in progress. A jury could properly find that preparation was long since completed. All that stood between appellants and success was a group of F.B.I. agents and police officers. Their timely intervention probably prevented not only a robbery but possible bloodshed in an area crowded with noontime shoppers. We note in closing that federal courts have upheld convictions for attempted bank robbery without evidence of either an assault, United States v. Foster, 478 F.2d 1001 (7th Cir. 1973), or actual entry into the target bank, United States v. Bussey, 507 F.2d 1096 (9th Cir. 1974). Cases such as these, however, should not divert a court

We have held that “[a] substantial step must be something more than mere preparation, yet may be less than the last act necessary before the actual commission of the substantive crime____” United States v.

refused to show her. All these documents, taken with the repeated instances in which she had shown an insistent wish to get access to such records, and with, her meetings in New York, made out a case which must háve satisfied any fair minded jury that she was engaged in the conspiracy with which she was charged; and that, when the right moment came, she meant to pass the packet to Gubitchev. Indeed, it, does not appear why she had not already done so before her arrest, as the agents presumably supposed that she had. Because the arrest in this way interrupted the consummation of the crime.. one point upon the appeal is that her conduct still remained in the zone of “preparation,” and that the evidence did not prove an “attempt.” This argument it will be most convenient to answer at the outset. A neat doctrine by which to test when a person, intending to commit a crime which he fails to carry out, has “attempted” to commit it, would be that he has done all that it is within his power to do, but has been prevented by intervention from outside; in short, that he has passed beyond any locus poenitentice. Apparently that was the original notion, and may still be law in England; but it is certainly not now generally the law in the United States, for there are many decisions which hold that the accused has passed beyond “preparation,” although he has been interrupted before he

the crime could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be.” This proposed section was changed slightly from the version proposed in the Study Draft: “(1) Offense. A person is guilty of criminal attempt if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of an offense, he intentionally engages in conduct constituting a substantial step toward commission of the offense. A substantial step is any conduct, whether act, omission, or possession, which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor’s intent to complete the commission of the offense. Factual or legal impossibility of committing the offense is not a defense if the offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be.” A comment justifying the study draft version of proposed section 1001 appears at 1 Working Papers of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws, 351-368 (1970). Proposed section 1001 is generally consistent with, and probably taken in part from, section 5.01 of the Model Penal Code (Proposed Official Draft 1962) : “(1) Definition of Attempt. A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he: “(a) purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or “(b) when causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does or omits to

DORSEY, District Judge.
Pending are cross-motions for summary judgment. Absent a genuine issue of material fact, if movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, summary judgment should enter. Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 56(c). Claimants and the government have filed statements of uncontested facts. Local Rule 9(c)(1). No Rule 9(c)(2) statements were filed. The facts stated are found to be uncontested.
FACTS
Gordin is President of Anchor. He is a citizen of Latvia. In April, 1992, he opened an account for Anchor at Fleet Bank. In November, 1992, $1,000,000 was transferred by wire from overseas to that account. Immediately, he withdrew that sum in cash. After wire transfers, he withdrew $515,000, $1,060,000 and $1,300,000 on March 23, 1993, April 7, 1993, and May 5, 1993, respectively. He immediately transported the money from New York by FinnAir to Latvia via Helsinki. No International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instrument Reports (CMIR or Customs Form 4790) were filed. His attorney had apprised him of the law concerning money transported out of the country.
On or about May 11, 1993, $500,000 was transferred by wire into Anchor’s account. Its money was then withdrawn by Gordin in $100 bills which he carried in a briefcase. He carried Anchor’s money as its president. He went to Bradley Airport, in Windsor Locks, Connecticut to board a TWA flight to Kennedy where he was booked to fly by FinnAir to Helsinki. As he was about to board at Bradley, carrying the briefcase, he was questioned by airport authorities as to his bags, one of which contained paint thinner. A check of the luggage disclosed the $500,000. He told law enforcement agents of his flight plan. He had no CMIR form. He stated no intention of filing such in interviews on May 11 and 12, the latter with his lawyer present and largely speaking for him. The $500,000 was seized.
FBI Agent McKenna further states that at Kennedy signs and announcements advise of the law requiring CMIR filing.
PROCEEDINGS
Except for the fact that the money came from Anchor’s bank account and was in the possession of Gordin, the record reflects no facts specifying the interests of claimants, but standing is not at issue. The $500,000 was seized. This action followed under 31 U.S.C. § 5317(e). Claimants argue there was no probable cause to seize or forfeit the $500,000. Probable cause for the seizure and forfeiture is dependent on an obligation to file a report as required by § 5316 which provides, in pertinent part:
(a) .... [A] person or an agent or a bailee of the person shall file a report under subsection (b) of this section when the person, agent or bailee knowingly—
(1) transports, is about to transport or has transported, monetary instruments of more than $10,000 at one time—
(A) from a place in the United States to.... a place outside the United States;
It is the government’s claim that, at the time of the seizure at Bradley, there was probable cause to believe that Gordin was attempting to transport the $500,000 from Bradley to a place outside the United States without filing a report, and thus the seizure, and now the forfeiture would be warranted in law.
The government’s claim of probable cause is best tested by analyzing the elements and evidence in support thereof:
a) Gordin was transporting. In a physical sense, this is not seriously disputed. The money was in a briefcase he was carrying.
b) He knew what he was carrying and the requirements of the law. This also is not disputed. See United States v. $359,500 in United States Currency, 828 F.2d 930 (2d Cir.1987).
If a report required under section 5316 with respect to any monetary instrument is not filed. the instrument.... may be seized and forfeited to the United States Government. Any property, real or personal, involved in a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of section 5324(b) may be seized and forfeited to the United States Government.
c) Money in the amount of $500,000 (over $10,000) was involved. This also is not disputed.
d) Gordin was attempting to transport from Bradley. This is in dispute.
e) Gordin was transporting, or about to transport, to a place outside of the United States. It is unquestioned but that Gordin was embarked on a journey that would end outside of the United States. In a literal sense he could be found to have been about to transport. The dispute, i.e. Gordin’s contention, is that he had not begun to transport, nor was he about to transport the money to a point outside of the United States because he had not journeyed so far as to have become obliged to file the report.
DISCUSSION
The first question is whether § 5316(a) literally applies. When a person conceives of transporting over $10,000 out of the country and takes the first step in a continuum that will lead to the actual transport out of the United States, he could be said to have been about to transport. The phrase, “about to transport” connotes a course of action with no precise delineation of the starting point. The reach of § 5316(a) extends from the start to the finish, using the futuristic “about to transport,” the present “transport” and the past “has transported.” It is not insignificant that Congress deleted the phrase “attempts to transport or have transported” and substituted the phrase “about to transport”. Pub.L. 99-570, § 1358(b). It thus injected a time spectrum for the targeted course of action but imprecisely. The test applied to attempts, ie. whether a “substantial step” toward performing the act in question was taken, United States v. Martinez, 775 F.2d 31, 35 (2d Cir.1985), is arguably analogous.
Whether Gordin had acted as to require filing a report is significant because there was clear evidence that he had no intention of doing so. At the seizure, he had $500,000 in hand and was embarking on a trip to end outside the United States. From his prior trips, there was a pattern of cash withdrawn and ending up outside the United States. It could readily be inferred that he would fly from Bradley to Kennedy and then, by FinnAir, to Helsinki taking the $500,000 with him. As he had not done so in the past, he had not prepared, nor did he intend, to file the required report. His knowledge of the requirement is readily inferable from the counsel of his attorney and signs at Kennedy announcing the requirement.
Application of § 5316(a) is assisted by (b) which provides:
(b) A report under this section shall be filed at the time and place the Secretary of the Treasury prescribes.
This was intended to authorize the Secretary “to specify events in advance of departure which would trigger the duty to file the report.” H.R.Rep. No. 99-855, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, at 19 (1986). Thus, Congress has been held to have intended to authorize the Secretary “to require the filing of currency reports well in advance of a person’s actual departure from the United States.” United States v. Bareno-Burgos, 739 F.Supp. 772, 780 (E.D.N.Y.1990). As there discussed, the Secretary failed to exercise the full authority by stating precisely the point at which the duty would be fixed. Id., citing the then version of 31 C.F.R. § 103.-27(b)(1), (3). That version, unchanged to May 11, 1993 and to date, fails to specify events or a time before departure at which the duty to report is triggered. The regulations in effect on May 11, 1993, require a report by one who physically transports or attempts to transport (31 C.F.R. § 103.23(a)) over $10,000, to be filed at “the time of departure” (31 C.F.R. § 103.27(b)(1)) “with the Customs Officer in charge at any port of entry or departure.” (id. at (b)(3)). Thus a “temporal and spatial proximity to [the] actual point of departure” is necessary for the duty to file to arise. Mercado v. U.S. Customs Service, 873 F.2d 641, 646 (2d Cir.1989); United States v. Bareno-Burgos, 739 F.Supp. at 781-82 and cases cited. One in Gordin’s posture, enplaning in New York for a flight to Miami, on a ticket to Colombia with a change of plane in Miami, “would [highly likely] carry through with these plans.” Id. The requirement has been described as conduct manifesting “a definite commitment to leave the country,” United States v. Cutaia, 511 F.Supp. 619, 625 (E.D.N.Y.1981). See United States v. Jenkins, 689 F.Supp. 342, 343 (S.D.N.Y.1988), rev’d in part on other grounds, 876 F.2d 1085 (2d Cir.1989). A “transport” has been found to have commenced in Pennsylvania, for venue purposes, United States v. Donahue, 885 F.2d 45, 52 (3d Cir.1989), but that case did not decide the obligation to file question where the flight to a point outside the United States was to commence in Miami. The statutes, absent any contrary regulation promulgated by the Secretary, do not clearly require the filing upon boarding a domestic flight which connects elsewhere with an international flight. United States v. Bareno-Burgos, 739 F.Supp. at 783.
The government argues that the seizure was nonetheless valid. It claims that Gordin attempted a transaction in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5324(b). As property involved in such a transaction, the $500,000 was forfeita-ble under the second sentence of 31 U.S.C. § 5317(c), added in 1992, which provides:
Any property, real or personal, involved in a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of section 5324(b) ... may be seized and forfeited to the United States Government.
Section 5324(b) prohibits evasion of the § 5316 reporting by failing to file, or causing or attempting to cause a failure to file. The government does not justify the seizure and forfeiture on the failure to file the report. Rather it relies on the fact that the $500,000 was personal property “involved in a transaction, or attempted transaction in violation of § 5324(b).” § 5317(c). It argues that Gor-din had gone so far in carrying out a transaction, transporting $500,000 from Anchor’s account in Connecticut to a point outside the United States without filing the required report, as to constitute an attempt. Arguably he attempted to violate the reporting law, §§ 5316(a)(1), 5324(b), and the property involved was therefore subject to seizure and forfeiture. § 5317(c). Arguably, Anchor’s money was in Gordin’s hand as Anchor’s bailee or agent such that it was “being transported from the time the instrument [was] delivered to the.... messenger or bailee through the time it is delivered to the addressee [or] intended recipient.” § 5317(c).
Though informed by counsel as to the law which pertained, none of Gordin’s four transports, totaling $3,875,000, were reported. Against that backdrop, the evidence showed Gordin withdrawing $500,000, which had just been wired into Anchor’s account, in cash, about to enplane to Kennedy and scheduled to depart Kennedy, shortly after arriving, for Helsinki. At the seizure, Gordin had no reporting form. He did not then, nor to this date, suggest that he would have reported the $500,000 being transported. He had placed the withdrawn cash in his bag, purchased tickets and arranged flights from Bradley to Kennedy to Helsinki. He was boarding the plane for the first leg of his journey to Latvia with the money. With all the information known at the time, it was well within the bounds of proper inference that Gordin’s intended course of action was to carry the money out of the country without reporting. § 5316(a).
