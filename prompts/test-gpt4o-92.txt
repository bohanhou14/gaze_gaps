The case at hand closely resembles the precedent set in *Helvering v. Winmill*, 305 U.S. 79, where the Supreme Court held that commissions paid on purchases of securities could not be deducted as business expenses. This interpretation, governed by Treasury regulations, has consistently maintained that stock-related costs such as commissions are part of the securities' cost basis rather than ordinary expenses. Similarly, *315 U.S. 626* reaffirmed the treatment of commissions and costs associated with the sale of securities, designating them as offsets against selling prices rather than deductible expenses unless deemed ordinary and necessary business expenses. The taxpayer's claim that unamended administrative interpretations lack the force of law contrasts sharply with the established judicial and legislative stance supporting the regulations. Therefore, the plaintiff's argument against the Bureau's ruling in I. T. 3806 is untenable given that these regulatory interpretations have been repeatedly upheld by the courts and tacitly approved by Congress without statutory amendment. The decision to capitalize such expenses remains firmly embedded in legal precedent.

But the plaintiff points out that the Supreme Court, in its opinion, expressly relies upon a Treasury Regulation of long standing which had survived several amendments and reenactments of the income tax law. Here we have no such situation.

the cost of the securities, respondent’s right to deduct is limited by § 23 (r). The Commissioner refused to permit the deductions beyond the extent of stock losses. His action was affirmed by the Board of Tax Appeals. The Court of Appeals held the commissions deductible if respondent was engaged in the business of buying and selling securities, and remanded for a finding as to the nature of his business. Article 282, Treasury Regulation 77, issued under the 1932 Act, provides that “Commissions paid in purchasing securities are a part of the cost price of such securities.” If this regulation governs, the respondent’s contention cannot be sustained. Regulations promulgated under the 1916 income tax law treated commissions in security purchases as a part of the securities’ cost and not as ordinary expense deductions. This interpretation has consistently reappeared in all regulations under succeeding tax statutes. In the period since 1916 statutes have from time to time altered allowable deductions, but it is significant that Congress substantially retained the original taxing provisions on which these regulations have rested. Treasury regulations and interpretations long continued without substantial change, applying to unamended or substantially reenacted statutes, are deemed to have received congressional approval and have the effect of law. There has been tacit, if not express, judicial approval for the administrative treatment of commissions as an element of the cost of securities. In Hutton v. Commissioner, 39 F. 2d 459, 460, the Court of Appeals recognized that “ It has been a settled

of the Revenue Act of 1934, or are they to be treated as offsets against selling price, relevant only to the determination of capital losses or gains? In Helvering v. Winmill, 305 U. S. 79, we held that a taxpayer who bought and sold securities could not deduct the commissions paid on his purchases as a business expense. Although the Winmill case arose under the Revenue Act of 1932, the statutory provisions and regulations there relevant are identical with those again in controversy here. And the conclusion we reached there — that a general regulation designating “commissions” as one of a long list of deductible business expenses is not controlling in the face of a specific regulation pertaining to commissions on securities transactions — is equally applicable here. The specific regulation pertaining to securities transactions provides: “Commissions paid in purchasing securities are a part of the cost price of such securities. Commissions paid in selling securities, when such commissions are not an ordinary and necessary business expense, are an offset against the selling price. . . .” If there is any justification for treating sales commissions differently from purchase commissions, it must depend upon the significance of the clause “when such commissions are not an ordinary and necessary business expense.” This clause first appeared in Treasury Regulations 77, accompanying the Revenue Act of 1932. In the income tax regulations prior to that time, it was consistently prescribed that commissions paid on purchases and sales of securities were to be treated

The plaintiff sues for the recovery of income taxes which, he says, he should not have been required to pay. He says that certain federal excise stamp taxes which he had to pay upon the transfer of corporation stocks were deductible by him from his 1947 income, but that he was not allowed the deduction, and therefore he was required to pay a larger income tax than he owed.
Until the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1943, federal stock transfer taxes, along with many other federal excise taxes, were deductible from income. By that Act, sub-paragraph F was added to Section 23(c) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. § 23(c) (1) (F) so that the section now provides that federal excise and stamp taxes are not deductible as taxes, but goes on to say “ * * * but this subsection shall not prevent such * * * taxes from being deducted under subsection (a)”. Subsection (a) of Section 23 permits the deduction, inter alia, of ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business. The plaintiff asserts that the stock transfer stamp taxes here in question were incurred by him in carrying on his business of buying and selling stocks as a trader on his own account.
The plaintiff alleges in his petition that his business was that of a trader in securities. If so, he had to pay stamp taxes on each sale of stock. It would seem that these taxes were ordinary and necessary expenses, and therefore deductible under the legislation adverted to above. The Government says they were not deductible because of a ruling of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, set forth in I. T. 3806, 1946-2 C. B. 41, which said, in part—
“(2) Federal stamp taxes paid on transfers or conveyances of securities or real estate upon sales thereof as a trader or other nondealer are selling costs or offsets against selling prices to be taken into account only in determining (net) amounts realized and gains or losses under section 111 of the Code on the sales; * * * ”
The plaintiff says that I. T. 3806 contradicts the statute and is invalid.
It will be remembered that, before the Revenue Act of 1943, these taxes were deductible as taxes, hence there was then no occasion to decide whether they were or were not ordinary and necessary business expenses. After the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1943, it was necessary to determine that question. If they were such, they were deductible in full. If not, they would be treated merely as an addition to the purchase price, or a deduction from the selling price, in computing taxable capital gains or losses. The Bureau determined that they were deductible in full as ordinary and necessary business expenses. This interpretation was continued until 1946, when I. T. 3806 was issued. It said, as we have seen, that traders, that is, persons who buy and sell stocks for their own accounts, may not have the deduction, but must capitalize the expense. In its Section 1 it says that dealers, that is, merchants of stock, may still have the deduction.
In 1947 the Bureau of Internal Revenue published Mim. 6083, 1947-1 C. B. 19, which withdrew the retroactive effect of I. T. 3806 by providing that such taxes should still be deductible by traders for the years 1944 and 1945, years which ended before I. T. 3806 was published.
We have, then, a situation in which the Bureau itself, for two years after its enactment, interpreted the statute as making these taxes deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses, which, on their face, they seem to be. Then without any amendment of the statute, or the publication of any Treasury Regulation, we have the Bureau issuing an I. T. which says the opposite. As we understand it, an I. T. is an instruction issued to the staff of the Bureau, as to how the law should be administered by the staff. The Bureau has no power to make law by such an instruction, even to the extent that the Secretary of the Treasury may make law by regulation. The Bureau’s original interpretation of the law was natural and logical. If one’s business is that of trading in stocks, and if he must pay a tax whenever he trades, the tax would seem to be an ordinary and necessary business expense, and therefore deductible under the express terms of the statute. It seems to us that stock transfer taxes are so directly connected with the particular capital transactions on which they are imposed, that it would be logical to change the law so as to require them to be capitalized. But we think the Bureau of Internal Revenue had no authority to so change the law by issuing an instruction to its staff.
