Fifth, Saenz-Jurado asserts he is actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted. To establish actual innocence, he must demonstrate that “it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him” in light of all the evidence. See Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 327-28 (1995); 523 U.S. 614. However, Saenz-Jurado has not presented new evidence that would meet this exacting standard. As noted in 232 F.3d 799, equitable tolling due to actual innocence requires substantial evidence and is applicable only in rare and exceptional circumstances. Without such evidence, his claim of actual innocence cannot justify equitable tolling.

Finally, regarding his request for the appointment of counsel, the district court correctly determined that there is no constitutional right to counsel in habeas proceedings. Our precedents do not warrant appointment of counsel given the lack of complexity and the straightforward procedural issues present. See 232 F.3d 799.

Accordingly, we DENY Saenz-Jurado’s request for a COA, his motion for appointment of counsel, and his application to proceed IFP.

target_text: Fifth, equitable tolling is also appropriate when a defendant is actually innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted. Gibson v. Klinger; 232 F.3d 799, 808 (10th Cir.2000). Saenz-Jurado argues that he is innocent because the cocaine he was convicted of distributing belonged to someone else. But given his concession that the cocaine was found inside the vehicle he was driving (even though it was also occupied by another individual), he has made no showing that, “in light of all the evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him” of the offense. Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (quotation omitted). Further, Saenz-Jurado’s claim that the state court did not establish a factual basis for his conviction faces the same deficiency; he does not make the required showing of actual innocence.

court). AEDPA’s one-year statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling but only “in rare and exceptional circumstances.” Davis v. Johnson, 158 F.3d 806, 811 (5th Cir.1998), cert, denied, 526 U.S. 1074, 119 S.Ct. 1474, 143 L.Ed.2d 558 (1999). Equitable tolling would be appropriate, for example, when a prisoner is actually innocent, Miller v. Marr, 141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.), cert, denied, 525 U.S. 891, 119 S.Ct. 210, 142 L.Ed.2d 173 (1998), when an adversary’s conduct — or other uncontrollable circumstances — -prevents a prisoner from timely filing, or when a prisoner actively pursues judicial remedies but files a defective pleading during the statutory period, Irwin v. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990). Simple excusable neglect is not sufficient. Id. at 96, 111 S.Ct. 453. Moreover, a petitioner must diligently pursue his federal habeas claims; a claim of insufficient access to relevant law, such as AEDPA, is not enough to support equitable tolling. Miller, 141 F.3d at 978. We agree with the district court that Mr. Gibson did not exercise due diligence in pursuing his federal claims. He has not demonstrated why he did not pursue his appeal out of time after receiving the state district court’s permission on June 13, 1996, or why he did not file his federal habeas petition within the 185 days after the state appellate court affirmed the denial of his post-conviction application. Mr. Gibson’s evidence that he could not obtain a copy of AEDPA

in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.” Murray v. Carrier, supra, at 496. To establish actual innocence, petitioner must demonstrate that, “‘in light of all the evidence,’” “it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.” Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, 327-328 (1995) (quoting Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142, 160 (1970)). The District Court failed to address petitioner’s actual innocence, perhaps because petitioner failed to raise it initially in his §2255 motion. However, the Government does not contend that petitioner waived this claim by failing to raise it below. Accordingly, we believe it appropriate to remand this ease to permit petitioner to attempt to make a showing of actual innocence. It is important to note in this regard that “actual innocence” means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency. See Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333, 339 (1992). In other words, the Government is not limited to the existing record to rebut any showing that petitioner might make. Rather, on remand, the Government should be permitted to present any admissible evidence of petitioner’s guilt even if that evidence was not presented during petitioner’s plea colloquy and would not normally have been offered before our decision in Bailey. In cases where the Government has forgone more serious charges in the course of plea bargaining, petitioner’s showing of actual innocence must also extend to those charges. In this case, the Government maintains that

previous_text: ORDER DENYING CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY
CARLOS F. LUCERO, Circuit Judge.
Abel Saenz-Jurado requests a certificate of appealability (“COA”) following the district court’s denial of his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 application for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court denied the application because it was time barred under § 2244(d)(1). For substantially the same reasons as the district court, we deny Saenz-Jurado’s request for a COA and dismiss the appeal.
I
On August 16, 1994, Saenz-Jurado pleaded guilty in Colorado state court to one count of unlawful distribution of a schedule II controlled substance. On December 6,1994, he was sentenced to ninety days’ confinement and four years’ probation. Saenz-Jurado did not appeal.
On May 29, 1997, Saenz-Jurado’s probation was revoked, and he was sentenced to four years in a community corrections program. On September 15, 1999, the community corrections program requested a warrant, claiming that Saenz-Jurado had failed to comply with program requirements. Saenzr-Jurado alleges that he was then arrested by federal authorities on September 16, 1999, and subsequently charged with possession of 500 or more grams of cocaine. After pleading guilty to the federal charge, he was sentenced to 159 months’ imprisonment and transferred to a federal prison in Texas to serve his federal sentence. On October 24, 2000, Colorado state officials filed a detainer against Saenz-Jurado seeking his return to Colorado following his release from federal custody.
On November 1, 2002, Saenz-Jurado commenced a state collateral proceeding challenging his Colorado conviction for unlawful possession of a schedule II controlled substance. On August 23, 2005, the petition was denied as untimely by the Colorado district court. The intermediate appellate court affirmed on March 22, 2007, and on November 5, 2007, the Colorado Supreme Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari.
Thereafter, on June 10, 2008, Saenz-Jurado filed the instant application for writ of habeas corpus under § 2254 in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. His § 2254 application was denied based on the one-year limitations pe-in § 2244(d)(1). Saenzr-Jurado then requested a certificate of appealability from the district court, moved for appointment of counsel, and applied for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (“IFP”) on appeal. The district court denied all three requests on November 6, 2008. He now seeks a COA from this court and once again requests appointment of counsel and leave to proceed IFP on appeal.
II
Because the district court denied his habeas application as well as his request for a COA, Saenz-Jurado may not appeal the district court’s decision absent a grant of a COA by this court. § 2253(c)(1)(A). To obtain a COA, Saenz-Jurado must make a “substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.” § 2253(c)(2). When the district court denies a habeas application on procedural grounds without reaching the underlying constitutional claims, as it did here, a petitioner is not entitled to a COA unless he can show both that “jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.” Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). An appellate court has discretion to resolve either the procedural or the substantive issue first. Id. at 485, 120 S.Ct. 1595.
The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”) imposes a one-year statute of limitations on § 2254 habe-as claims. § 2244(d)(1). In the usual case, the period begins to run from “the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expira tion of the time for seeking such review.” § 2244(d)(1)(A). The state court entered judgment against Saenz-Jurado on December 6,1994. He did not appeal. Thus, Saenz-Jurado’s conviction became final and AEDPA’s one-year limitations period began to run on January 20, 1995, forty-five days after judgment was entered against him. See ColoApp. R. 4(b) (requiring that a notice of appeal from a state criminal conviction be filed within forty-five days of the entry of judgment). As a result, Saenz-Jurado was required to file his federal habeas application by January 20, 1996. See § 2244(d)(1). Because he did not file the present application until June 10, 2008, given the absence of the benefit of more than twelve years of tolling, it is time barred under AEDPA.
Construing his request for a COA liberally, as we must, see Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), Saenz-Jurado urges that we consider the limitations period equitably tolled on at least five bases: (1) he did not know how to read or write in either English or Spanish, (2) he lacked access to legal materials, (3) he suffered from mental illness, (4) he could not appeal his state conviction because his attorney had a conflict of interest, and (5) he is actually innocent. He also wishes to appeal the district court’s refusal to appoint counsel.
Equitable tolling may be proper in rare and exceptional circumstances. Coppage v. McKune, 534 F.3d 1279, 1280 (10th Cir.2008). Such circumstances may arise when a petitioner “diligently pursues his claims and demonstrates that the failure to timely file was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond his control.” United States v. Gabaldon, 522 F.3d 1121, 1124 (10th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).
First, Saenz-Jurado contends he is entitled to tolling because he did not know how to read or write in either English or Spanish. But Saenz-Jurado only states that despite extensive studying, he has not yet been able to pass the GED exam. Although not written in perfect English, his federal collateral attack has been accepted and understood by the courts. He has pointed to no evidence beyond his bare assertion that he would not have been able to file a similarly intelligible pleading at an earlier time. See Yang v. Archuleta, 525 F.3d 925, 929-30 n. 7 (10th Cir.2008). The record does not support the conclusion that his language difficulties are extraordinary.
Second, and relatedly, Saenz-Jurado claims to have lacked access to legal materials because of his language deficiencies and because of various transfers between different federal facilities. To justify tolling under AEDPA, “[i]t is not enough to say that the [correctional] facility lacked all relevant statutes and case law.” Miller v. Marr, 141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998). Nor is there a constitutional duty to provide access to legal materials in a prisoner’s preferred language. Yang, 525 F.3d at 930. Thus, Saenz-Jurado’s lack of access to legal materials cannot support the necessary tolling under AEDPA.
Third, Saenz-Jurado claims he is entitled to tolling because he suffered from mental illness. However, his allegations on this point are conclusory and lack support in the record. For example, in his brief to this court, Saenz-Jurado does not indicate from what mental illness he suffered; rather, he summarily asserts that he has seen a psychologist and that he could not timely file his application because of “mental illness.” Cf. Biester v. Midwest Health Servs., Inc., 77 F.3d 1264, 1268 (10th Cir.1996) (holding that equitable tolling on the basis of mental illness must be based on exceptional circumstances such as adjudged incompetence or institutionalization). Thus, he has failed to demonstrate that his mental condition constitutes an extraordinary condition. See Gabaldon, 522 F.3d at 1124.
Fourth, Saenz-Jurado argues that his state trial attorney had a conflict of interest because the attorney was simultaneously representing a co-defendant. We reject this argument because Saenz-Jura-do has not explained how this alleged conflict of interest (which also appears to be one of the substantive bases for the habeas relief he seeks) prevented him from timely filing his federal habeas application.
