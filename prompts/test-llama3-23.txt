In the case of Waterman v. United States, the defendant, Albert Tucker, was convicted of bank robbery and appealed the conviction, arguing that his confession was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights, and that the confession and its fruits were erroneously admitted into evidence against him.

The court held that the alleged error, if indeed error, was a constitutionally harmless error, and therefore, the judgment of conviction was affirmed. The court relied on the cases of Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), and Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969), which hold that even if there is a supportable claim of constitutional error, the admission of the confession was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court also noted that the evidence against Tucker was overwhelming, including the testimony of his accomplices, the bank employee who identified him as one of the robbers, and the unimpeachable photograph taken by the hidden movie camera showing Tucker committing the crime. The court concluded that the admission of the allegedly unconstitutionally obtained confession and money, if error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

In contrast, the Supreme Court has held in cases such as Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U.S. 560, 78 S.Ct. 844, 2 L.Ed.2d 975 (1958), that even though there may have been sufficient evidence, apart from the coerced confession, to support a judgment of conviction, the admission in evidence, over objection, of the coerced confession vitiates the judgment of conviction. However, in this case, the court found that the admission of the confession was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

In conclusion, the court held that the alleged error in the admission of the confession was constitutionally harmless and therefore the judgment of conviction was affirmed. The court relied on the cases of Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), and Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969), and noted that the

Consequently, the general statement in Payne v. Arkansas which we have quoted, supra, applicable there, is obviously inapplicable here. Even if Tucker’s allegations of improper officer conduct could be substantiated and his confession were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights, a reversal of the conviction and a remand for a new trial would be an act of complete futility. Without the evidence of the confession and of the recovered loot appellant’s guilt was overwhelmingly proved by other clearly constitutionally admissible evidence.

which should provide it. This is not a case where the facts concerning the circumstances surrounding the confession are undisputed and the task is only to judge the voluntariness of the confession based upon the clearly established facts and in accordance with proper constitutional standards. Here there are substantial facts in dispute: Jackson said that he was in pain from his wounds, gasping for breath and unable to talk long. A state witness described Jackson as in strong condition despite his wounds. According to Jackson, the police told him he could have no water and would not be left alone until he gave the answers the authorities desired. These verbal threats were denied by the State. Whereas Jackson claimed his will was affected by the drugs administered to him, the State’s evidence was that the drugs neither had nor could have had any effect upon him at all. Whether Jackson is entitled to relief depends upon how these facts are resolved, for if the State is to be believed we cannot say that Jackson’s confession was involuntary, whereas if Jackson’s version of the facts is accepted the confession was involuntary and inadmissible. As we have already said, Jackson is entitled to a reliable resolution of these evidentiary conflicts. If this case were here upon direct review of Jackson’s conviction, we could not proceed with review on the assumption that these disputes had been resolved in favor of the State for as we have held we are not only unable to

Amendment has been violated by admission into evidence of a coerced confession be the subject of an independent determination here, see, e. g., Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143, 147-148; “we cannot escape the responsibility of making our own examination of the record,” Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 316. While, for purposes of review in this Court, the determination of the trial judge or of the jury will ordinarily be taken to resolve evidentiary conflicts and may be entitled to some weight even with. respect to the ultimate conclusion on the crucial issue of voluntariness, we cannot avoid our re sponsibilities by permitting ourselves to be “completely bound by state court determination of any issue essential to decision of a claim of federal right, else federal law could be frustrated by distorted fact finding.” Stein v. New York, 346 U. S. 156, 181. As state courts are, in instances such as this, charged with the primary responsibility of protecting basic and essential rights, we accord an appropriate and substantial effect to their resolutions of conflicts in evidence as to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of factual events and happenings. This is particularly apposite because the trial judge and jury are closest to the trial scene- and thus afforded the best opportunity to evaluate contradictory testimony. But, as declared in Ward v. Texas, 316 U. S. 547, 550, “when, as in this case, the question is properly raised as to whether a defendant has been denied the due

stated he .had been released, and avowed that Blackburn “talked sensible and give [sic] sensible answers,” was clear-eyed, and did not appear nervous. Blackburn’s counsel again objected to admission of the statement, but the objection was overruled and the confession was submitted to the jury. After the Alabama Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment and held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not require exclusion of the confession, Blackburn petitioned this Court for cer-tiorari. Thus was the constitutional issue raised, decided,, and presented to' this Court for review. After according all of the deference to the trial judge’s decision which is compatible with our duty to determine .constitutional questions, we are unable to escape the-conclusion that Blackburn’s confession can fairly be characterized only as involuntary. Consequently the conviction must be set aside, since this Court, in a line of decisions beginning in 1936 with Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278, and including cases by now too well known and too numerous to bear citation, has established the principle that the Fourteenth Amendment is grievously breached when an involuntary confession is obtained by state officers and introduced into evidence in a criminal prosecution which culminates in a conviction. Since Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227, this Court has recognized that coercion can be mental as well as physical, and that the blood óf the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition. A number of cases have demonstrated, if demonstration were needed, that the efficiency of the rack

previous_text: WATERMAN, Circuit Judge:
After a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York appellant Albert Tucker was convicted on April 15, 1968 upon two counts of bank robbery, one armed and one unarmed. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. He appeals from the conviction on the ground that a confession was obtained from him in violation of his Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights, and the confession and the fruits thereof were erroneously admitted into evidence against him at the trial. We hold that the alleged error, if indeed error, was a constitutionally harmless error, and we affirm the judgment of conviction entered below.
On the morning of November 30, 1967, three men, apparently armed, robbed the Bankers* Trust Company in Mas-peth, Long Island. Almost immediately after the three men entered the bank hidden movie cameras were activated by one of the tellers and also by the bank manager. The three robbers took $22,-600.00 in cash from behind the tellers’ counters and then fled.
Five days later a Commissioner’s warrant was issued for the arrest of Albert Tucker for his participation in the robbery. In the afternoon of the next day appellant was arrested pursuant to this warrant. A participant in the robbery with Tucker, David Jones, had already confessed and implicated him and another man, Joseph Bostic, in the robbery.
Tucker was arrested at his home and was then taken to FBI headquarters in a government automobile. The arrest ing agent testified that he advised Tucker of his Miranda rights while en route. At headquarters Tucker was photographed, fingerprinted and processed for about twenty minutes and was then put in an interview room with two federal agents and a Queens County District Attorney’s Squad Detective who had participated in the arrest. One agent read to Tucker the standard “Advice of Rights” form used by the FBI to advise all defendants of their constitutional rights. The accused then read the form himself and allegedly stated that he understood his rights. One agent asked Tucker whether he would sign the waiver at the bottom of the standard form and Tucker signed.
After approximately an hour and a half of interrogation Tucker confessed to having been one of the three men who robbed the Bankers Trust Company. The confession was reduced to writing and he signed the transcription. Thereafter the officers and Tucker had dinner, following which Tucker took an agent to a house in the Bronx where some of the bank loot was stored.
At appellant’s trial photographs taken by the bank’s hidden movie cameras were introduced into evidence by the Government and one of these photographs showed Albert Tucker in the act of robbing the bank. Also, at the trial a bank employee positively identified Tucker as one of the robbers, and Tucker’s robber companions, Jones and Bostic, testified against him.
A hearing was held outside the presence of the jury in order to determine the admissibility of Tucker’s confession. From the testimony then adduced the trial judge concluded that Tucker “was fully advised of his Constitutional rights, and that the confession was voluntarily and understandably made, and without threats or coercion.” Thereafter, the confession and the money recovered from the Bronx house were introduced into evidence.
Appellant contends that the confession obtained from him by the police was obtained in violation of the McNabb-Mallory rule because he was not promptly brought before a United States Commissioner for arraignment on the charges before the interrogation began; that the waiver form he signed was deceptive and coercive; that he was threatened, tricked and cajoled into incriminating himself; that the interrogating agents ignored his request to consult with an attorney; and that he did not understand his right to have an appointed attorney present during the interrogation. We need not discuss these numerous claims for, even if there is a supportable claim of constitutional error, in view of the particular facts of this case the admission of appellant’s confession was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969).
Aside from the allegedly unconstitutionally obtained confession and the money thereafter recovered from the Bronx house, the overwhelming evidence that established Tucker’s guilt was in the possession of the police, or was known to them, before he was arrested or questioned after the arrest. At trial he was positively identified as one of the bank robbers by a bank employee who was present during the robbery, both of Tucker’s accomplices testified against him and implicated him in the robbery, and the unimpeachable photograph of the robbery taken by the hidden movie camera shows Tucker committing the crime. Here the issue of Tucker’s guilt or innocence was in no way a close question. Unchallenged and unimpeached evidence established guilt. Even without the eyewitness testimony an unimpeachable photograph is sufficient in and of itself to convict Tucker. On these particular facts we have no hesitancy in applying the Chapman rule and in finding that the admission of the allegedly unconstitutionally obtained confession and money, if error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Compare Ruona v. United States, 403 F.2d 215 (9 Cir. 1968) with Pearson v. United States, 389 F.2d 684 (5 Cir. 1968); see Lockett v. United States, 390 F.2d 168 (9 Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 877, 89 S.Ct. 175, 21 L.Ed.2d 149 (1968).
We are not unmindful of the Supreme Court statements to the effect that
