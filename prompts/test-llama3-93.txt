In the case of Rogers v. Daimler-Chrysler, the plaintiff, Georgia Rogers, brought claims of discrimination and harassment against her employer, Daimler-Chrysler. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant, finding that Rogers failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII and Ohio law.

Rogers alleged that she

reference_case_1: 530 F.3d 451

OPINION McKEAGUE, Circuit Judge. Plaintiff-appellant Deborah Thornton is a former employee of Federal Express Corporation (“FedEx”). She was discharged on August 24, 2004, when, after a 16-month leave of absence, she did not return to work, despite being notified of return-to-work opportunities. Plaintiff had taken the leave of absence due to stress stemming from sexual harassment by her immediate supervisor, David Bragorgos. Plaintiff did not pursue the return-to-work opportunities because she continued to receive treatment for panic disorder and fibromyalgia from health care providers who she says had not released her to return to work. Plaintiff commenced this action in the Western District of Tennessee on April 1, 2005, charging FedEx with sex discrimination and retaliation, in violation of federal and state civil rights laws, and with discrimination based on her disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Defendant FedEx’s motion for summary judgment was granted by the district court in a 19-page opinion and order dated January 22, 2007. Proceeding pro se, plaintiff appeals from the district court’s judgment, contending the court failed to view the record evidence in the light most favorable to her. For the reasons that follow, we affirm. I Having duly considered the record in light of the parties’ appellate arguments, we find the district court’s opinion to be clear and well-reasoned in most respects. First, we find no error in the holding that plaintiffs quid pro quo sexual harassment claim under Title VII fails for lack of evidence that plaintiff suffered a

was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Canitia v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., 903 F.2d 1064, 1066 (6th Cir.1990). Hafford was disciplined five months (August 1993) and ten months (January 1994) after he filed the OCRC and EEOC charges. In February 1994, after he filed these charges, four disciplinary actions were taken that year, and seven disciplinary actions were taken over a seven month period the next year. We agree with the magistrate judge that “[b]ecause the disciplinary actions occurred two to five months after Hafford filed charges, and are fairly evenly spread over a period of time, the inference of a causal connection based on temporal proximity alone is tenuous.” Absent additional evidence, this loose temporal proximity is insufficient to create a triable issue. V. For the reasons stated, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of summary judgment to defendant on Hafford’s § 1981 claims and Title VII claims for religion-based hostile work environment and retaliation, and REVERSE the district court’s grant of summary judgment to defendant on Hafford’s Title VII claim of race-based hostile work environment based on the conduct of his fellow correction officers and supervisors. We therefore REMAND this case to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. . ODRC’s Standard of Employee Conduct Rule 14(a) states that "[a]cts of discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, handicap, or sexual orientation” may be punishable by a written reprimand on the first

previous_text: MEMORANDUM OPINION
KATZ, District Judge.
This matter is before the Court on Defendant’s motion for summary judgment, pro se Plaintiffs memorandum in opposition, and Defendant’s reply thereto. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. For the reasons that follow Defendant’s motion is well taken.
I. Background
1. Procedural History
In light of this lengthy litigation and for purposes of clarity, the Court deems it necessary to set forth the following history:
In July 2001, Georgia Rogers (“Rogers”) initiated a complaint against Daimler-Chrysler Corporation. Rogers v. Daimler-Chrysler, Case No. 3:01CV7360 (N.D.Ohio) (“Rogers I ”). Rogers was initially represented by counsel but five months into the litigation counsel moved for and was granted leave to withdraw his representation. (Rogers I, Doc. No. 15.) After several extensions of time to retain new counsel, the litigation proceeded forward with Rogers representing herself. In December 2002, Plaintiff was granted dismissal of the action under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1). Contained within that dismissal was the language:
If no settlement or agreement is reached within one (l)year of the dismissal of the above captioned case, under rule 41-(A), it is my understanding that I may again file this matter in Federal Court.
(Rogers I, Doc. No. 39.)
On December 10, 2003, Plaintiff moved to refile her case (Rogers I, Doc. No. 40) and filed a second case which was ultimately dismissed.
In July 2004, the Court granted Plaintiffs motion and reopened Rogers I. Following discovery and repeated attempts at dismissal on February 10, 2006, the Court issued the following Order:
Upon the request of Plaintiff and with the consent of Defendant, this matter is dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a); each party to bear their own costs.
(.Rogers I, Doc. No. 97.)
On February 12, 2007, Rogers filed a third complaint pro se. The complaint is a mirror of those filed in Rogers I and II, except for the following handwritten additions:
After ¶ 11 ...
After Plaintiff filed charges in July 2001, Defendant fired Plaintiff without just cause effective May 2, 2003.
Prior to the prayer for relief,
Ref Cases No. 3:01CV7360 and 3:03CV7743 as part of this action.
(.Rogers III, Doc. No. 1.)
Following the Defendant’s motion to dismiss, the Court dismissed the wrongful discharge claim and denied dismissal on the remaining claims. (.Rogers III, Doc, No. 17.)
2. Factual Background
Georgia Rogers began working for the Defendant’s predecessor in 1985 at its Toledo Jeep facility as an accounting clerk or timekeeper. In the late 1980s, Chrysler decided to consolidate its accounting functions into a division entitled Manufacturing Group Accounting (“MGA”) which would function out of its Sterling Heights Assembly Plant (“SHAP”). Ms. Rogers was offered a transfer to SHAP and advised that her failure to transfer could result in her layoff from the Toledo facility due to her low seniority status. As a result, in April 1988, Ms. Rogers was transferred to SHAP. In her complaint Ms. Rogers contends that although she was told her accounting duties would be transferred to SHAP, in fact, those job functions were distributed to other Toledo workers and performed at the Toledo facility. (Complaint at ¶ 4.)
During Ms. Rogers tenure at SHAP, she repeatedly but unsuccessfully requested a transfer back to Toledo. (Id. at ¶ 6.) Ms. Rogers alleges she learned that certain dispossessed Jeep workers could return to Toledo which apparently stemmed from a failure to post such information at the SHAP. This posting advised former Toledo assembly plant employees of a possible transfer back to the Toledo facility and advised them to complete an election form. (Doc. No. 43, Ex. M.) Ms. Rogers requested but was denied a transfer based upon her failure to complete a transfer election form.
On June 21, 2000, Ms. Rogers filed a civil rights charge with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (“OCRC”) based upon her denial of a transfer. (Gordon Aff., Attachment 4.) In November 2000, Ms. Rogers submitted a transfer election form to Chrysler (Doc. No. 43, Ex. R) which was accepted by the Defendant. (Doc. No. 43, Ex. V.) The investigation by the OCRC found the June 200 charge by Ms. Rogers to be unsubstantiated and issued a not probable determination as well as a right-to-sue letter dated September 20, 2001. (Doc. No. 43, Attachment U.)
In 2001, John Ocock (“Oeock”), a Chrysler management employee, spoke with Ms. Rogers at SHAP and learned of Rogers’ dissatisfaction with her job. (Ocock Affid. ¶ 5.) At the time, Ocock was in charge of the steel offload program and working remotely our of the SHAP in Toledo. Ocock was in need of someone to perform clerical tasks associated with the program and he concluded that Ms. Rogers, with training and supervision, would be able to perform those tasks. In addition, Ocock was aware that Ms. Rogers was unhappy with her situation at the SHAP and wanted to return to Toledo. It was Ocock’s opinion that Ms. Rogers could remain a SHAP employee but work remotely out of Toledo under his supervision to assist him with the steel offload program. Ms. Rogers expressed an interest in such a situation. (Rogers Dep. Vol. 2, pp. 70-71.) Ocock requested and obtained approval for Ms. Rogers to work in a new bargaining unit position, that of off-load analyst under Ocock. (Ocock Affid., ¶ 5.)
Ms. Rogers commenced her new position in June 2001 working remotely out of Toledo. (Id. at ¶ 6.) Ocock allowed Ms. Rogers to work a flexible schedule as long as she put in her eight hours a day. (Id.) Ocock and Rogers worked on Mondays at the SHAP and then the remainder of the week in Toledo. (Id.) Ms. Rogers, under Ocock’s supervision, created a handbook/ job description for her new position. (Id.)
All seemed to go smoothly until October 19, 2001. On that date, Ocock avers as follows:
I was teaching Ms. Rogers about a particular computer screen and the program/screen contained a comment field.
I was standing behind Ms. Rogers, who was seated at her computer. I told Ms. Rogers to type anything into the comment field — it did not matter what was in the comment field, so long as something was entered in it. She did not understand what I meant, so I reached around with my right hand and randomly struck a key on the keyboard three times, just so that something would be entered in the field. I continued my instruction until Ms. Rogers interrupted me and asked me to please type something different. It was at that point that I looked at the comment field and realized that I had struck the lowercase “k” key and thus had typed “kkk” in the comment field. I was embarrassed, felt terrible and apologized profusely. Ms. Rogers and I then continued with the training. I did not mean to type anything that could be taken as a reference to the Klu Klux Klan on Ms. Rogers’ computer. I heard nothing more from Ms. Rogers about this incident until several months later.
(Ocock Affid. ¶ 7.)
On January 23, 2002, Ms. Rogers filed a charge of discrimination with the OCRC based on race due to conduct by Ocock. The OCRC made a “no probable cause” finding and issued a right-to-sue letter on January 31, 2003. (Gordon Affid., Attachments 2 and 3.)
Ms. Rogers continued to work remotely from Toledo until February 2002, at which time she returned to SHAP full-time. (Ocock Affid., ¶ 8.) In May 2002, Ms. Rog ers’ employment was terminated for failure to report to work after a medical leave. (Rogers Depo., Vol. 1, Ex. J.) A claim of wrongful discharge pertaining to this final event was dismissed by the Court in its opinion of September 19, 2007, 2007 WL 2746914.
II. Legal Standards Applicable
A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate where “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The moving party bears the initial responsibility of “informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,’ which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The movant may meet this burden by demonstrating the absence of evidence supporting one or more essential elements of the non-movant’s claim. Id. at 323-25, 106 S.Ct. 2548. Once the movant meets this burden, the opposing party “must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (quoting Fed.R.CivP. 56(e)).
Once the burden of production has so shifted, the party opposing summary judgment cannot rest on its pleadings or merely reassert its previous allegations. It is not sufficient “simply [to] show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Rather, Rule 56(e) “requires the nonmov-ing party to go beyond the pleadings” and present some type of evidentiary material in support of its position. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. at 2553; see also Harris v. General Motors Corp., 201 F.3d 800, 802 (6th Cir.2000). Summary judgment must be entered “against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552.
“In considering a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view the facts and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.” Williams v. Belknap, 154 F.Supp.2d 1069, 1071 (E.D.Mich.2001) (citing 60 Ivy Street Corp. v. Alexander, 822 F.2d 1432, 1435 (6th Cir.1987)). However, “ ‘at the summary judgment stage the judge’s function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter,’ ” Wiley v. U.S., 20 F.3d 222, 227 (6th Cir.1994) (quoting Anderson, 447 U.S. at 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505); therefore, “[t]he Court is not required or permitted ... to judge the evidence or make findings of fact.” Williams, 154 F.Supp.2d at 1071. The purpose of summary judgment “is not to resolve factual issues, but to determine if there are genuine issues of fact to be tried.” Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc. v. Am. Eagle Outfitters, Inc., 130 F.Supp.2d 928, 930 (S.D.Ohio 1999). Ultimately, this Court must determine “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505; see also Atchley v. RK Co., 224 F.3d 537, 539 (6th Cir.2000).
B. Title VII and Ohio Law
It is unlawful under federal law for any employer “to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s ... sex.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(l). It is also unlawful under Ohio law “[f]or any employer, because of the ... sex ... of any person ... to discharge without just cause ... or otherwise to discriminate against that person with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment.” Ohio Rev. Code § 4112.02(A). The Ohio Supreme Court has held that evidence sufficient to support a finding of discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is necessary before a violation of § 4112.02(A) can be shown. Plumbers & Steamfitters Joint Apprenticeship Comm. v. Ohio Civil Rights Comm’n, 66 Ohio St.2d 192, 196, 421 N.E.2d 128, 131 (1981); see also Little Forest Medical Ctr. of Akron v. Ohio Civil Rights Comm’n, 61 Ohio St.3d 607, 609-10, 575 N.E.2d 1164, 1167 (1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 906 112 S.Ct. 1263, 117 L.Ed.2d 491 (1992); El Grande Steak House v. Ohio Civil Rights Comm’n, 99 Ohio App.3d 557, 562, 651 N.E.2d 440, 444 (1994); Twinsburg City Schools v. Ohio Civil Rights Comm’n, 86 Ohio App.3d 527, 529, 621 N.E.2d 591, 593 (1993). Therefore, the Court will consider Plaintiffs federal and state claims together.
The employee carries the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of job status discrimination in employment. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). An employee establishes a prima facie case of discrimination by presenting evidence which, when viewed in the light most favorable to her, would permit a reasonable jury to find that she was denied advancement opportunities because of her sex. Rose v. National Cash Register Corp., 703 F.2d 225, 227 (6th Cir.1983).
She can meet this burden by presenting either direct or circumstantial evidence of discrimination. Direct evidence is found, for instance, where an employer’s policy is discriminatory on its face, see Trans World Airlines, Inc., v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 121, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985), or where a corporate decision-maker expressly states a desire to remove employees in the protected group, see LaPointe v. United Autoworkers Local 600, 8 F.3d 376, 379-80 (6th Cir.1993). In direct evidence cases, once a plaintiff shows that the prohibited classification played a motivating part in the employment decision, the burden of both production and persuasion shifts to the employer to prove that it would have terminated the employee even had it not been motivated by impermissible discrimination. See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 244-45, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 1787-88, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (plurality opinion); Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Co., 29 F.3d 1078, 1081 (6th Cir.1994).
Where no direct evidence of discrimination exists, an employee can establish her prima facie case by indirect or circumstantial evidence. In that instance, she must show (1) that she is a member of the protected class; (2) that she was denied opportunities or experienced an adverse employment decision; (3) that she was otherwise qualified; and (4) that other individuals outside the protected class received more favorable treatment. See Siegel v. Alpha Wire Corp., 894 F.2d 50, 53 (3d Cir.1990); Gagné v. Northwestern Nat’l Ins. Co., 881 F.2d 309, 313 (6th Cir. 1989). Where the plaintiff presents only circumstantial evidence of discrimination, the burden of production then “shift[s] to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for the less favorable treatment. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. Once the employer has met its burden, the burden shifts back to the employee to show that the employer’s stated reason for the less favorable treatment is pretextual. Id. at 804, 93 S.Ct. at 1825. In circumstantial evidence cases, the burden of persuasion remains at all times with the employee. Gagne, 881 F.2d at 315-16.
III. Discussion
Plaintiff brings claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000 and 42 U.S.C. § 1981 for discrimination on the basis of race and sex, along with parallel claims under Ohio Revised Code § 4112 et seq. Her remaining claims are best characterized as: (1) wrongful transfer to the SHAP; (2) denial of a transfer back to Toledo; (3) harassment; and (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress.
A Wrongful Transfer
The pertinent parts of Plaintiffs complaint are set forth as follows:
2. Sometime on or about the date of April 11, 1988, the Plaintiff was transferred to defendant’s facility (f.k.a. Jeep) located in Sterling Hts, Michigan.
3. The purported reason given to Plaintiff for this transfer was that of a low-seniority lay-off.
4. That the Plaintiff who at one time had the title of cost accounting clerk was wrongfully told that she and her job duties were being transferred to Michigan but in fact the same cost accounting job functions remained in Toledo and were distributed among other Jeep workers and which job title and duties the Plaintiff could have still performed in Toledo as opposed to being transferred to Michigan.
(Complaint at p. 3.)
While these allegations are framed as unfair actions, there is nothing in the pleadings nor does the Plaintiff, in her response, rely or cite to evidence which establishes that these actions were based upon her claims brought under Title VII. Assuming her claim is brought under Title VII, Plaintiff did not file a charge of discrimination with the requisite administrative agency. Strouss v. Michigan Dept. of Corrections, 250 F.3d 336, 342 (6th Cir. 2001). Even if this hurdle were met, in considering the prima facie analysis Plaintiff does qualify as a member of the protected class, she arguably suffered an adverse employment action in the form of a transfer to a less desirable location, and the Court will assume she was otherwise qualified. However, there is no evidence that individuals outside the protected class were given favorable treatment over Plaintiff. As the Plaintiff is unable to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas paradigm, her claim under Title VII is without merit.
As to her state law claims, Plaintiffs complaint states as follows:
[D]ue to the wilful[sie] and intentional nature of the adverse acts of the Defendant committed against the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff has suffered and anguish and stress and embarasssment[sic].
(Complaint at pp. 4-5.) Thus, to the extent that Plaintiffs allegations fall under the Ohio Revised Code § 4112.01 through § 4112.99, such claims are barred by a six year statute of limitation. Cosgrove v. Williamsburg of Cincinnati Mgt. Co., 70 Ohio St.3d 281, 638 N.E.2d 991 (1994). As the Plaintiffs transfer to the SHAP occurred in 1988, any viable claim would have expired in 1994. As Plaintiffs initial case was not filed until 2001, any claim regarding this wrongful transfer to the SHAP is not viable as a matter of law and must be dismissed.
B. Requests to Return to Toledo
Plaintiffs second claim is in the form of a denial of transfer back to the Toledo facility along with the failure to be apprized of such a procedure:
5. [Smarting in 1988-9 and to date [Plaintiff] did repeatedly request a transfer back to the Toledo plant facility but to no avail.
7. That in the year of 1998, the Plaintiff, while working in Michigan was informed of the fact that dispossesed [sic] Jeep workers could return to Toledo and as such the Plaintiff did file charges with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission regarding this differential treatment of her and other similarly situated dispossessed Jeep workers when she was denied such a transfer back to Toledo.
8. That the Plaintiff was denied other job slots available to her and for which job slots she was competent to perform but the Defendant entity did not allow the Plaintiff to obtain those available jobs at the Toledo site and which if allowed to do so, the Plaintiff would have increased her benefits and job mobility at the Toledo plant.
(Complaint at pp. 3-4.)
1. Denial of Transfers
The Plaintiff indicates making repeated requests to return to Toledo. Employing the McDonnell Douglas analysis, the Plaintiff has not offered specifics as to which positions she applied for, how she was qualified for these positions or who the successful applicants were such that they were outside the protected class. Plaintiff s allegations that other employees were returned to the same, similar or new positions, without more, are conclusory and fail to establish a cause of action under Title VII or Ohio law.
2. Failure to Inform Regarding Opportunity to Return to Toledo Facility
The Plaintiff further charges she was not notified regarding an opportunity to apply for a transfer back to Toledo. When she was advised of the misstep, she applied for a transfer but that request was denied. She then filed a charge with the OCRC, ultimately resulting in a right-to-sue letter after the Commission issued a “no probable cause” determination on her charge of discrimination. The right-to-sue letter was issued on September 20, 2001. After notification from the administrative agency, here the EEOC, a plaintiff has 90 days from receipt of the letter to file suit based upon that charge. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f). Therefore, the Plaintiff had until late December 2001, to pursue a claim on this issue. At the time of her initial suit, Rogers I, the Plaintiff received the right-to-sue letter, she was represented by counsel , and her complaint was not amended to include this information.
The Defendant contends such claims, whether state or federal, are time-barred under the statute of limitations or the Ohio savings statute.
As noted previously, the Supreme Court of Ohio in Cosgrove held Ohio Rev.Code § 4112.99 to be a remedial statute, thereby subjecting any claims thereunder to Ohio Rev.Code § 2305.07 and a six year statute of limitations. Therefore, to the extent a 1998 failure to post claim is premised un der § 4112.99, it is well outside the applicable statute of limitations.
Ohio’s Savings Statute allows for refiling of an action within a year following a timely filed action which is then dismissed without prejudice. Ohio Rev.Code § 2305.19. In this case, the parties agreed to a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, with leave to refile in December 2002. In 2004, Plaintiff re-filed her action, which again was dismissed, without prejudice, on February 10, 2006. The instant case was filed in February 12, 2007. However, as recently noted by an Ohio appellate court, “The Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that ‘the saving statute can be used only once to refile a case.’ ” Conway v. RPM, Inc., 2007 Ohio 1007, 2007 WL 701094 No. (8th Dist.2007), quoting Thomas v. Freeman, 79 Ohio St.3d 221, 227, 680 N.E.2d 997, 1002 (1997). See also Hancock v. Kroger Co., 103 Ohio App.3d 266, 268-269, 659 N.E.2d 336, 338 (1995). Applied to the case at hand, this means that when Plaintiff filed her action in February 2007, her cause of action must have been viable under the applicable statute of limitations since she had refiled once already under the savings clause.
In her response, the Plaintiff indicates that she “was not made aware of her rights until after the statute of limitations” and therefore requests her claims be considered as timely filed. Contained in the right-to-sue letter was a “Notice of Suit Rights” which stated the timing of filing a federal claims and added, “The time limit for filing suit based on a state claim may be different.” (Rogers Dep. Vol. 1, Ex. U.) Even construing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, it would appear the Plaintiff was on notice of her right to pursue litigation.
The Court in Conway rejected an equitable estoppel argument, noting that there was a “prohibition against the repeated use of the savings statute [which] could not be waived.” As correctly noted by the Defendant, while Ms. Rogers’ refiling of her case (the first time) was within the statute of limitations and an appropriate use of the savings statute, her third complaint is not. Therefore, any claims under a failure to post theory are prohibited as a matter of law.
Finally, assuming arguendo that the Plaintiff could overcome this procedural hurdle, she has failed do demonstrate how she qualified for such a transfer or how the failure to post was discriminatory on the basis of her race or sex. For example, the posting states that it aimed at:
establishing] a mechanism for former Toledo Assembly Plant employees, who were indefinitely laid off and subsequently given preferential hiring consideration in plants covered by the National Production and Maintenance Agreement, to return to Toledo Assembly Plant.
(Rogers Depo., Vol. 1, Ex. M.) (Emphasis added.) There is no evidence that Ms. Rogers met this qualification. Moreover, Plaintiffs statements regarding the legal standard are incorrect:
The burden of proof in this instance does not rest with the plaintiff but with the defendant to establish whether forms were filed timely or eligibility for transfer existed. This issue must be addressed.
(Pltf s Oppos. at p. 4, ¶ B.) In the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, her claim is without merit as a matter of law.
C. Harassment and Medical Malingering
Plaintiffs claims on these issues are as follows:
6. That, in addition, the Plaintiff due to the direct acts and actions of the Defendant entity, suffered a medical flare-up of a prior cervical injury due to the Plaintiff being required to do repetitive motions and which injury would not have occurred but for the wrongful transfer to the Michigan plant and which injury has caused her hurt, harm and economic loss.
9. That the Plaintiff is currently being harassed by the Defendant entity regarding her being a medical malingerer and and [sic] bogus attacks on the Plaintiff regarding her attendance and leave history; and this harassment could result in her job termination.
10. That at all times material herein, the Plaintiff has documented medical evidence that exonerates her from any unexcused medical absences and attendance or leave questions and that this harassment by the Defendant entity is bogus and without merit and is designed and intended to force the Plaintiff to quit or to give the Defendant entity cause to wrongfully discharge her from their employment.
(Complaint at. p. 3-4.)
1. Medical Flare-Ups
With regard to Plaintiffs alleged medical injuries, she contends that they are related to her transfer to the SHAP “and relevant to the Plaintiffs claims that she suffered maltreatment by her employer as a result of injury and disability over the years.” The Defendant submits these claims are immune under the workers’ compensation immunity doctrine.
The appellate court in Saunders v. Holzer Hosp. Found., 176 Ohio App.3d 275, 282, 891 N.E.2d 1202, 1208 (2008) addressed the workers’ compensation immunity concept as follows:
Employers who comply with section 4123.35 of the Revised Code shall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute for any injury, or occupational disease, or bodily condition, received or contracted by any employee in the course of or arising out of his employment, or for any death resulting from such injury, occupational disease, or bodily condition occurring during the period covered by such premium so paid into the state insurance fund, or during the interval the employer is a self-insuring employer, whether or not such injury, occupational disease, bodily condition, or death is compensable under this chapter.
(Emphasis in original.) Even assuming the Plaintiff sustained her injuries in the course of her employment, Ms. Rogers has not demonstrated the Defendant has not complied with Ohio Rev.Code § 4123.35. Without any evidence to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact on the applicability of immunity to the Defendant, any physical injuries are the province of the workers’ compensation scheme. As such, the claims under medical flare-ups are dismissed.
2. Harassment
Initially, Plaintiff cites to her perception by the Defendant as that of a medical malingerer, in error. She appears to consider the harassment by the Defendant to have consisted of this unfair perception as well as creating a hostile work environment.
Courts recognize two types of sexual harassment claims: (1) harassment that creates an offensive or hostile work environment, and (2) quid pro quo harassment, whereby a supervisor demands sexual favors as a condition for job benefits. Kauffman v. Allied Signal, Inc., 970 F.2d 178 (6th Cir.1992), Rabidue v. Osceola Re fining Co., 805 F.2d 611, 618 (6th Cir. 1986), Yates v. Avco Corp., 819 F.2d 630, 634 (6th Cir.1987). While, as the Supreme Court has instructed, “the labels quid pro quo and hostile work environment are not controlling for purposes of establishing employer liability,” they are still relevant to the “threshold question [of] whether a plaintiff can prove discrimination in violation of Title VII.” Burlington Indus. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 753, 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998).
To prove a claim of hostile work environment harassment based upon sexual harassment, a plaintiff-employee must show by a preponderance of the evidence:
(1) that she was a member of a protected class; (2) that she was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) that the harassment was based on sex; (4) that the harassment unreasonably interfered with her work performance by creating a hostile, offensive, or intimidating work environment; and (5) that there is a basis for employer liability.
