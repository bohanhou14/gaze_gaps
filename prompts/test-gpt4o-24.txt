Long further contends that the search of the 1997 Chevy Blazer, parked in the OC Store lot, violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The Blazer was registered to Nancy Big Eagle and Freedom Long, not Jason Long. Under established precedent, Fourth Amendment rights are personal and cannot be asserted vicariously. See Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 133-34 (1978). To challenge a search, Long must demonstrate a personal, reasonable expectation of privacy in the Blazer. See Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 88 (1998); United States v. Gomez, 16 F.3d 254, 256 (8th Cir. 1994).

Based on the evidence, Long failed to show such an expectation of privacy. Similar to the passengers in Rakas who could not challenge the search of an automobile's glove compartment, Long had no documented ownership or possessory interest in the Blazer. See Rakas, 439 U.S. at 148-49. Consequently, Long lacks standing to contest the search (Reference case: 379 F.3d 524).

Even absent a standing issue, the district court found the search valid under the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, as recognized in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (1984). The facts indicate that Officer Spargur and his team acted within the scope of the warrant in good faith (Reference case: 605 F.3d 604). Considering precedents and the evidential lack of ownership documents, we affirm the district court’s decision.

Therefore, any evidence obtained from the Blazer remains admissible, and the officers' actions did not violate Long’s Fourth Amendment rights (Reference case: 739 F.3d 391).

target_text: Long also challenges the officers’ search of the Blazer parked in the OC Store’s public parking lot. “Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights that may not be asserted vicariously.” United States v. Barragan, 379 F.3d 524, 529 (8th Cir.2004). “To mount a successful motion to suppress, an accused must first establish that he personally has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the object that was searched.” United States v. Stringer, 739 F.3d 391, 396 (8th Cir.2014). Long admits he did not own the Blazer, and Long has provided no evidence suggesting he had any constitutionally protected connection to the vehicle or its contents. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 605 F.3d 604, 609 (8th Cir.2010) (deciding a defendant who “neither owned nor drove the [searched vehicle] and was only an occasional passenger therein” could not challenge the search of the vehicle). Long thus has shown no reasonable expectation of privacy in the Blazer and cannot now contest the search of the vehicle. See id.

into the compartment. The government responds by arguing that Barragan’s consent is irrelevant, because he did not have standing to challenge the search at all. Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights that may not be asserted vicariously. See Rakas v. Rlinois, 439 U.S. 128, 133-34, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978). An individual asserting Fourth Amendment rights “must demonstrate that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place searched, and that his expectation is reasonable[.]” Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 88, 119 S.Ct. 469, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998). “If a defendant fails to prove a sufficiently close connection to the relevant places or objects searched he has no standing to claim that they were searched or seized illegally.” United States v. Gomez, 16 F.3d 254, 256 (8th Cir.1994). We conclude that Barragan did not have standing to challenge the search of the Expedition. ' In Rakas, the Supreme Court held that the defendants did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the glove compartment or area under the seat in a car in which they were “merely passengers.” 439 U.S. at 148-49, 99 S.Ct. 421. “Like the trunk of an automobile, these are areas in which a passenger qua passenger simply would not normally have a legitimate expectation of privacy.” Id.; see also United States v. Macklin, 902 F.2d 1320, 1330-31 (8th Cir.1990). At the suppression hearing, Barragan testified that his name did not appear on any ownership documents, and that he did not have

Jason Long (Long) pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), after the district court denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained by United States Bureau of Indi- . an Affairs (BIA) officers when searching •the store once operated by Long. As permitted by his.plea agreement, Long appeals this denial, maintaining the officers’ searches were unconstitutional. Because we agree with the district court that the officers’ actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment, we affirm.
1. BACKGROUND
Jason Long, a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, operated the “OC Store” in Lower Brule, South Dakota, on the Lower Brule Sioux Reservation. The OC Store appears to have been a one-time gas station converted into a convenience and novelty store. The store was housed in a metal building with few exterior windows; all of the windows facing the park ing area are covered with metal grates. The store sold soda, coffee, some food, tobacco products, and an eclectic assortment of other merchandise in addition to offering arcade games and movie rentals.
On July 28, 2012, at approximately 4:20 a.m., BIA Officer Shane Spargur encountered three juveniles in Lower Brule who he suspected were violating the tribe’s curfew. Officer Spargur noticed the juveniles had fireworks, which were illegal to ignite other than during a three-day period for celebrating Independence Day. Officer Spargur questioned the juveniles about the fireworks, and one “stated that he just bought them down at the OC Store.” Officer Spargur then proceeded approximately two blocks to the OC Store “to make contact with” Long about the sale of the fireworks.
When Officer Spargur arrived at the store, he was “unsure” whether it “was open or closed.” He did not see an open/ closed sign nor any posted business hours. An exterior street light in the parking lot and a flood light by the front door were on. Officer Spargur could hear loud music coming from inside. Although the store was not “fully lit,” “[i]t was pretty well lit” such that Officer Spargur could see the store’s interior and merchandise. At that point, Officer Spargur did not see any customers or employees. Having never been to the store before, Officer Spargur was not sure whether these facts indicated the store was open or closed. Officer Spargur ultimately concluded the store was open because of the lights, music, unlocked doors, and the juveniles’ report that they had “just” purchased fireworks there a few minutes before.
Officer Spargur entered the OC Store through two initial doors — both of which were closed but unlocked — leading to a small entryway. He then stopped at a third door, the main door, and “knock[ed] and announce[d] police a couple of times.” Although he thought the store was open, Officer Spargur testified he did the knock and announce “because of the time and me working as a police officer not just barging in and going in there ... just gave the opportunity to someone — for someone to come to the door to answer it.” After receiving no response, Officer Spargur opened the main door, which was also unlocked, and after observing an individual he later learned was Long’s son inside, he entered the store.
Officer Spargur then encountered another of Long’s sons, Freedom Long, in the store’s concession area. Officer Spargur discussed the fireworks with Freedom. Freedom acknowledged the juveniles had been in the store, but he denied the children had bought fireworks. Officer Spar-gur asked Freedom to retrieve Long, who was sleeping in another room. Based on Freedom’s slurred speech and deliberate actions, Officer Spargur believed Freedom was under the influence of some kind of drug. While Freedom was fetching Long, Officer Spargur noticed a small package on one of the concession tables that, based on his experience and training, he “recognized ... as a package normally holding synthetic marijuana.” Once Long emerged from his room, Officer Spargur briefly discussed the fireworks with him, reminded him not to sell fireworks after Independence Day, apologized for waking him, and then left the store without seizing the suspicious package.
After leaving the store, Officer Spargur began preparing an affidavit to obtain a search warrant. Officer Spargur spoke with the police chief, conducted some internet research to confirm the package he had seen was consistent with synthetic marijuana, and then telephoned tribal judge Lorrie Miner.
Judge Miner was at her home — approximately sixty miles away — when Officer Spargur called to have her “sign the search warrant telephonically.” Telephonic warrants are not common in Lower Brule — -Judge Miner had only considered two telephonic requests for search warrants during her four-year tenure, and Officer Spargur testified this is the only telephonic warrant he had ever obtained. Neither party recorded the call, so precisely what was said is unknown, but Officer Spargur testified he read Judge Miner the affidavit and “the meat” of his warrant application. Officer Spargur specifically explained he read the things to be searched verbatim, but Officer Spargur did not recall whether he had read the warrant itself to Judge Miner.
At Long’s first suppression hearing, Judge Miner had a limited recollection of her conversation with Officer Spargur. Judge Miner testified that during the conversation she would have placed Officer Spargur under oath. Although she recalled being “on the telephone for quite some time” and “Officer Spargur [giving her] a detailed account as to what had occurred,” Judge Miner could not remember whether Officer Spargur read the warrant itself. Judge Miner stated she believed she would have had Officer Spargur read the warrant to her “so I know what I am saying yes to.” Judge Miner further elaborated she “would have wanted a description of ... what they were searching for and where they needed to search” and she would have asked questions if the information Officer Spargur provided was not specific enough to support probable cause. At the end of the conversation, Judge Miner approved the warrant. Judge Miner testified she approved the warrant based solely on the information Office Spargur provided by phone.
After Judge Miner approved the warrant, Officer Spargur assembled a team of officers and searched the OC Store. The officers seized eighty grams of synthetic marijuana in twenty-six packages like that initially seen by Officer Spargur. The officers also searched a 1997 Chevy Blazer located in the OC Store parking lot. The vehicle was registered to Nancy Big Eagle and Freedom Long, and it also contained synthetic marijuana. Officer Spargur placed Long under arrest and interrogated him at the station.
On August 6, 2012, BIA Officer Jason La Mons entered the OC Store with Rae-lynn Her Many Horses and Joshua Brouse, the owner of the building housing the OC Store, to investigate a reported burglary. Officer La Mons was familiar with the store and had spoken to Vicki Her Many Horses — the prior owner and Long’s aunt — “many times” in the preceding week. Vicki had informed Officer La Mons she and Long were having a “family dispute,” and “she did not want” Long in her building. Upset about recent break-ins, Vicki told Officer La Mons she wanted the police to investigate. Because of the break-ins, on August 4, 2012, Vicki sold the building to Brouse, the “long term” boyfriend of Vicki’s daughter, Raelynn.
Raelynn and Brouse took the officer inside the store and showed him items that had been moved. Once inside, Officer La Mons found a witness statement bearing Long’s name, a hundred-dollar bill, and an open shipping box filled with invoices— items that, according to Brouse and Rae-lynn, had not been in the building before the break-in. La Mons collected these items as evidence of the suspected burglary and then went to Long’s house to speak with Long. Long admitted entering the OC Store, so Officer La Mons placed him under arrest. Long was again interrogated at the station.
Long later was charged with three drug offenses. Long filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the July 28 and August 6 searches and the statements he made to the officers while in custody on both dates, claiming violations of the Fourth Amendment and his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).
The magistrate judge assigned to the case recommended excluding all evidence obtained from the store on July 28, reasoning Officer Spargur’s initial entry into the OC Store was unconstitutional. The magistrate judge recommended admitting the remaining evidence, including the synthetic marijuana found in the Blazer. The district court, adopting the magistrate’s recommendation in part, denied Long’s motion to suppress in its entirety.
Long conditionally pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distrib-' ute a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). The district court sentenced Long to time served plus three years of supervised release. Long’s guilty plea preserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress, which Long now does.
II. DISCUSSION
“In an appeal from a district court’s denial of a motion to suppress evidence, this court reviews factual findings for clear error, and questions of constitutional law de novo.” United States v. Douglas, 744 F.3d 1065, 1068 (8th Cir.2014) (quoting United States v. Hollins, 685 F.3d 703, 705 (8th Cir.2012)). Long contends this court should review the district court’s factual findings de novo because the district court partially rejected the magistrate judge’s recommendation, and because the district court did not conduct its own hearing or view any live testimony. Long cites no legal authority supporting this contention, and our well-established precedent calls for clear error review. See, e.g., United States v. Maxwell, 778 F.3d 719, 731-33 (8th Cir.2015) (reviewing the trial court’s factual findings regarding a motion to suppress for clear error when the trial court declined to adopt the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation), petition for cert. filed (U.S. July 8, 2015) (No. 15-5137); United States v. Hatcher, 275 F.3d 689, 690-92 (8th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (same).
A. July 28 Search
1. Initial Entry
Long claims Officer Spargur violated the Fourth Amendment by entering the OC Store without a warrant. The Fourth Amendment protects individuals “against unreasonable searches and seizures” conducted by government officials, U.S. Const, amend. IV, and under certain circumstances, we exclude evidence obtained in violation of its strictures, see United States v. Davis, 760 F.3d 901, 903 (8th Cir.2014). The critical issue here is “whether [Long] ha[d] ‘a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy’ ” in the OC Store sufficient to trigger the Fourth Amendment’s protections. Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170, 177, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984) (quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 360, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring)). Long “ ‘has the burden of showing both a subjective expectation of privacy and that the expectation is objectively reasonable; that is, one that society is willing to accept.’ Whether [Long] had a subjective expectation of privacy is a question of fact,” which this court reviews for clear error. United States v. Perry, 548 F.3d 688, 691 (8th Cir.2008) (quoting United States v. McCaster, 193 F.3d 930, 933 (8th Cir.1999)).
Long enjoyed some expectation of privacy in the OC Store on July 28. See New York v. Burger, 482 U.S. 691, 699, 107 S.Ct. 2636, 96 L.Ed.2d 601 (1987) (“The Court long has recognized that the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures is applicable to commercial premises, as well as to private homes.”); Dow Chem. Co. v. United States, 476 U.S. 227, 235, 106 S.Ct. 1819, 90 L.Ed.2d 226 (1986) (“Plainly a business establishment or an industrial or commercial facility enjoys certain protections under the Fourth Amendment.”). Even so, “[a]n expectation of privacy in commercial premises ... is different from, and indeed less than, a similar expectation in an individual’s home,” Burger, 482 U.S. at 700, 107 S.Ct. 2636, and a business owner or operator does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the portions of a business open to the public, at least during normal business hours. See Maryland v. Macon, 472 U.S. 463, 469, 105 S.Ct. 2778, 86 L.Ed.2d 370 (1985) (“[Respondent did not have any reasonable expectation of privacy in areas of the store where the public was invited to enter and to transact business.... The officer’s action in entering the bookstore and examining the wares that were intentionally exposed to all who frequent the place of business did not infringe a legitimate expectation of privacy.”). When a commercial property is not open to the public, a reasonable expectation of privacy may exist. See United States v. Swart, 679 F.2d 698, 701 (7th Cir.1982) (“[T]he officers knew the business was closed. Commercial establishments do not extend an implicit invitation to enter during non-business hours or when there are no employees on the premises.”); cf. See v. City of Seattle, 387 U.S. 541, 545, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 18 L.Ed.2d 943 (1967) (holding the state cannot punish a business owner for refusing to authorize a warrantless administrative search of his commercial premises “not open to the public”).
Here, the parties dispute whether the store was open or closed when Officer Spargur entered, and the facts plausibly could support either conclusion. The music, lights, unlocked doors, type of convenience store, and the fact that one of the juveniles claimed to have “just” bought fireworks at the store all suggested the OC Store was open. The dim lights, the initial lack of visible employees or customers, and the time of night suggested the store was closed.
Ultimately, the burden to show a reasonable expectation of privacy is on Long. See Perry, 548 F.3d at 691. Yet Long presented no evidence of the store’s operating hours, how the store typically looked when closed, or even that the store was in fact closed when Officer Spargur entered.
After reviewing the testimony, and noting the closeness of the question, the district court concluded “Long ... failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the OC Store was closed and thus that Long had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the OC Store at the time of the entry.” “Absent a showing of clear error it is not our role to second guess the district court’s factual determinations.” Lowder v. United States, 831 F.2d 785, 787 (8th Cir.1987). Under the circumstances existing at the time Officer Spargur entered the store, we cannot say the district court clearly erred in determining Long failed to prove the store was closed. See United States v. Almeida-Perez, 549 F.3d 1162, 1173 (8th Cir.2008) (“[W]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact-finder’s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.”). The district court thus did not err in concluding Long had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the public areas of the OC Store where the evidence was left in plain view because the store was open to the public when Officer Spargur entered. See Macon, 472 U.S. at 469, 105 S.Ct. 2778.
2. Post-Warrant Search of the Store
Long challenges Officer Spar-gur’s subsequent search of the OC Store claiming the telephonic warrant did not conform with tribal and federal law because, among other things, the warrant itself was never read to Judge Miner and the telephone conversation was not recorded. The district court refused to suppress evidence obtained during the post-warrant search of the store however, concluding the good-faith exception articulated in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), protected Officer Spargur’s actions. We review the application of the good-faith exception de novo. See United States v. Jackson, 784 F.3d 1227, 1231 (8th Cir.2015). Assuming, without deciding, the warrant was deficient, we agree with the district court that the Leon good-faith exception applies.
Under the good-faith exception, evidence is not excluded “‘when an officer acting with objective good faith has obtained a search warrant from a judge or magistrate and acted within its scope,’ even if the warrant is subsequently invalidated.” Cannon, 703 F.3d at 412 (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 920, 104 S.Ct. 3405).
We have recognized four circumstances that preclude a finding of good faith: “(1) when the affidavit or testimony supporting the warrant contained a false statement made knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for its truth, thus misleading the issuing judge; (2) when the issuing judge wholly abandoned his judicial role in issuing the warrant; (3) when the affidavit in support of the warrant is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable; and (4) when the warrant is so facially deficient that no police officer could reasonably presume the warrant to be valid.”
Id. (quoting United States v. Fiorito, 640 F.3d 338, 345 (8th Cir.2011)). In evaluating a search under Leon, we “must look at the objectively ascertainable' question of whether a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite a judge’s issuance of the warrant.” Jackson, 784 F.3d at 1231.
Long first claims Judge Miner’s personal biases led her to “wholly abandon[ ] her judicial role.” In addition to being a tribal judge, Judge Miner was also a member of a tribal judicial committee involved in promoting legislation that criminalized synthetic marijuana on the reservation. Judge Miner also routinely included as a condition of release for arrestees released on bond, “Defendant shall not enter OC Novelties or any other business where synthetic marijuana or synthetic stimulants are sold, offered for sale or possessed.” Long thus claims Judge Miner was not a neutral magistrate because she had “actively lobbied” for the passage of the resolution outlawing synthetic marijuana and had already made “the determination that the OC Store was selling synthetic drugs.”
We have explained that a judge abandons her judicial role when she “does not serve as a neutral and detached actor, but rather as a ‘rubber stamp for the police’ and ‘an adjunct law enforcement officer.’ ” United States v. Carpenter, 341 F.3d 666, 670 (8th Cir.2003) (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 914, 104 S.Ct. 3405). Judge Miner testified at length about her role on the judicial committee and her prior knowledge of Long and the OC Store. Based on this testimony, the district court concluded Judge Miner was not a strident proponent of synthetic marijuana prosecution, nor was she biased against Long. The district court also credited Judge Miner’s testimony, finding “she issued the warrant solely on the information contained in the affidavit and not on a preconceived notion of Long’s guilt,” and we will not disturb that credibility finding. See United States v. Robbins, 682 F.3d 1111, 1115 (8th Cir.2012) (explaining “ ‘credibility findings are well-nigh unreviewable’ ” on appeal (quoting United States v. Jones, 254 F.3d 692, 695 (8th Cir.2001))).
We further agree with the district court that Judge Miner’s knowledge of and involvement in the small tribal community is not the type of conduct that constitutes abandoning her role as a neutral and detached magistrate. See United States v. Heffington, 952 F.2d 275, 279 (9th Cir.1991) (refusing “to disqualify small-town judges on demand” merely because “judges and police officers in rural counties often know more about the local criminal recidivists [than do] their more urban colleagues”); see also, e.g., United States v. Scroggins, 361 F.3d 1075, 1084 (8th Cir.2004) (declaring a judge abandons her neutral role when she is so involved in the issuance of a search warrant she “essentially becom[es] a police officer in a robe”).
Long also asserts Judge Miner “wholly abandoned her judicial role” by failing to have Officer Spargur read her the full text of the search warrant. Assuming the warrant was not read, this failure does not suggest Judge Miner “acted as a rubber stamp” for law enforcement. United States v. Decker, 956 F.2d 773, 777 (8th Cir.1992) (affirming the lower court’s conclusion that a judge abandoned his judicial role because the judge did not read the warrant and “failed to note both that the prosecutor had not signed the warrant and that the warrant did not list the property to be seized” (footnote omitted)). Here, Officer Spargur read Judge Miner the application and affidavit — portions of which are reproduced in the warrant itself — and Judge Miner testified she would have questioned Officer Spargur if the information he provided was not sufficient. Long does not dispute that Judge Miner was given enough information to establish probable cause to search, nor does he contend Judge Miner or Officer Spargur acted in bad faith. Under these circumstances, any failure to have Officer Spargur read the full text of the warrant was not a departure from Judge Miner’s neutral judicial role. See Leon, 468 U.S. at 916, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (“[T]he exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates.”).
Finally, Long asserts Leon’s good-faith exception does not apply because the procedure used to obtain the warrant was so deficient no reasonable officer would have relied on the warrant. Officer Spargur read Judge Miner the application and “the meat” of the affidavit verbatim, giving Judge Miner enough information to establish probable cause to search, and at the end of the long conversation Judge Miner approved the warrant. Officer Spargur was reasonable in believing the warrant was valid. See United States v. Stonerook, 134 Fed.Appx. 982, 983-84 (8th Cir.2005) (unpublished per curiam) (affirming the denial of a motion to suppress evidence obtained through a telephonic warrant and rejecting the defendant’s claim “that no reasonable police officer could have relied in good faith on the validity of [a] search warrant” issued in violation of state “law regarding telephonic search warrants”); United States v. Hessman, 369 F.3d 1016, 1018, 1022-23 (8th Cir.2004) (applying the good-faith exception to a technically deficient warrant obtained by fax); United States v. Richardson, 943 F.2d 547, 548, 550-51 (5th Cir.1991) (refusing to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a telephonic warrant that had not met all requirements).
