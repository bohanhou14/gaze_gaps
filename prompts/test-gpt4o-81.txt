Generation:

Plaintiff seeks an award of attorneys' fees and costs associated with the litigation. Title VII, under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k), allows for such an award in the court's discretion (503 F.2d 177). The primary purpose of this provision is to enable plaintiffs to obtain competent legal representation in their fight against discrimination (641 F.2d 880). In this instance, the jury has already rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on multiple claims of discrimination and retaliation, entitling him to reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs of the suit.

Furthermore, according to precedent, a plaintiff may voluntarily waive attorneys' fees during settlement negotiations, provided there is no coercion or demand by the defendant to do so (762 F.2d 1093). In this case, plaintiff's counsel did not waive any claims to attorneys' fees and therefore, is entitled to a fee award.

Given the favorable jury verdict and in line with the statutory provisions and policies underlying Title VII, the Court will approve plaintiff's motion for reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing this action. The specific amount will be determined after a thorough review of detailed billing records submitted by plaintiff's counsel.

reference_case_1: 762 F.2d 1093

MacKINNON, Senior Circuit Judge: Sharon Moore brought a Title VII class action suit that was settled prior to trial pursuant to a consent decree entered by the district court. In the settlement process Moore and her counsel waived all claims for attorneys’ fees and costs otherwise available under section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k). After Moore’s agreement to the settlement as class representative but prior to a fairness hearing as to class members, Moore changed her position and requested that the court separately modify the settlement to include attorneys’ fees and costs. The district court rejected Moore’s proposal and affirmed the settlement. This case presents the narrow question of whether the fee-shifting provision of Title VII prohibits a plaintiff from voluntarily offering to waive attorneys’ fees and costs during simultaneous negotiations of merits, fees, and costs. We hold that in this case simultaneous negotiations are permissible, and that a plaintiff may voluntarily waive attorneys’ fees and costs if done so without a demand by the defendant. On the merits, because we believe that the district court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm. I. Background Appellant Sharon A. Moore was a black employee of appellee National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”) from November 1978 to February 1980. On December 1, 1980, she initiated this class action against NASD, alleging discrimination against blacks and females in recruitment, selection, training, evaluation, promotion, and work assignments in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act

fee should depend on the identity of the losing party. Our conclusion is based on both the language of the statute and the policies that underlie it. Our starting point, of course, is the statutory text. The attorney’s fee section provides that, in any Title VII action, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs, and the .. . United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k) (1976)- (emphasis added). The language of the statute indicates that the calculation of the fee should not vary with the identity of the losing defendant, and the policies underlying the attorney’s fee provision are fully consistent with this plain language. Those policies, as we have seen, are two. The primary purpose is to help persons obtain competent counsel with which to vindicate civil rights through litigation. E. g., Piggie Park, 390 U.S. at 402, 88 S.Ct. at 966. Nothing in the statute suggests that the incentive to ferret out discrimination, provided by the prospect of an attorney’s fee, should be any less when the government is the defendant. If anything, it is even more important to provide adequate fees to employment discrimination litigants who prevail against the government. In Parker v. Califano, 561 F.2d 320 (D.C. Cir. 1977), this court observed that Title VII litigants against the government face greater obstacles than litigants against private defendants. We noted: Unlike private sector employees,

the District Court was able to fix with a reasonable degree of accuracy, though not with exactitude, the approximate amount of Mrs. Evans’ damages. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Mrs. Evans $1,100 to be paid jointly by all defendants and $500 to be paid by the Hotel. Ill ATTORNEY’S FEES Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k) provides: “In any action or proceeding under this subchapter the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the Commission or the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs, and the Commission and the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.” Pursuant to this authority, the District Court concluded that “[i]n addition to the damages specified, plaintiff will be awarded her costs and nominal attorney’s fees of $1,000.” Appendix, p. 6, 5 FEP Cases 396. Mr. Whitworth Stokes, attorney for Mrs. Evans, then filed a motion for reconsideration of the court’s ruling. He did not seek a specified amount for attorney’s fees; however, he submitted to the District Court: 1. His affidavit as the attorney employed by plaintiff in this action; 2. An itemized expense schedule; 3. An exhibit (3% pages) showing in chronological order the daily time spent by him, excepting from this the time for his services in the course of amending the complaint, unsuccessful motions for summary judgment, and the motion for reconsideration;

previous_text: OPINION
PAUL L. FRIEDMAN, District Judge.
After a trial before a jury over a seven-day period beginning on November 29, 1995, the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff John Blair Hayes, finding by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) he was denied a promotion to a position for which he was qualified by virtue of the defendant’s intentional discrimination against him because of his race; (2) that he was denied a promotion to a position for which he was qualified because of the defendant’s intentional retaliation against him because of his prior EEO activity; and (3) that thereafter the person who was appointed to the job for which he had applied, Barbara Twombly, intentionally retaliated against him because of his prior EEO complaint regarding his non-selection for the position. The jury awarded plaintiff $50,000 on each of these three claims, and the Court entered judgment on the verdict for plaintiff in the amount of $150,000, together with costs.
The matter is now before the Court on plaintiffs motion for an award of equitable relief and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff argues that in addition to the compensatory damages awarded by the jury, Title VII requires the Court to provide plaintiff with the following equitable relief: (1) retroactive appointment to the position of Director of the Division of Acquisition Management; (2) retroactive promotion to the GS-15 level at an appropriate step within that grade; (3) full back pay (with interest) and other benefits; (4) recrediting of both annual leave and sick leave, amounting to approximately 850 hours; (5) back pay for a week of leave without pay (with interest); (6) an injunction prohibiting the Department of Health and Human Services from discriminating against plaintiff because of his race and from retaliating against him because of his successful litigation in this matter; (7) an award of the costs of bringing these actions and the related administrative claims, including reasonable attorneys’ fees; and (8) an order directing the defendant to correct its records to reflect the jury’s verdict and the equitable relief provided by the Court.
DISCUSSION
Title VII entitles individuals to be “[made] whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination.” Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 418, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2372, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975). In order to effectuate this purpose, “Congress took care to arm the courts with full equitable powers” so that the injured party may be “placed, as near as may be, in the situation he [or she] would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed.” Id. at 418-19, 95 S.Ct. at 2372-73; see Lander v. Lujan, 888 F.2d 153, 156 (D.C.Cir.1989). The district court has “considerable discretion” in choosing the method or methods of redress, Lander v. Lujan, 888 F.2d at 156; see McKenzie v. Sawyer, 684 F.2d 62, 75 (D.C.Cir.1982), although this discretion is to be exercised “in light of the large objectives of [Title VII].” Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. at 416, 95 S.Ct. at 2371.
A Retroactive Appointment, Promotion and Back Pay
Plaintiff seeks appointment as Director of the Division of Acquisition Management, the position for which the jury found that he was qualified but was denied appointment because of intentional discrimination on the basis of race and because of intentional retaliation against him because of his prior EEO activity. As plaintiff points out, the Special Verdict Form demonstrates that the jury expressly and specifically concluded that plaintiff would have been selected as Director of the Division of Acquisition Management absent such racial discrimination and reprisal.
The government argues against this form of equitable relief. It maintains that to make plaintiff the head of the Division would be “severely detrimental” and would undermine the ability of the Division to operate effectively because of the “already unfortunate relationship plaintiff has established with his colleagues.” The government maintains that “given plaintiffs disrespectful and uncooperative attitude, his placement in this position would seriously undermine the Division’s morale and potentially paralyze its ability to operate.” Plaintiff responds that any evidence concerning Mr. Hayes’ disrespectful and uncooperative attitude and his potential to create a morale problem should be disregarded because the jury disbelieved the witnesses who testified about plaintiffs shortcomings and uncooperative attitude.
“Title VII envisioned that making a victim whole would include his reinstatement to the position he would have held but for the discrimination.” Lander v. Lujan, 888 F.2d at 156. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g) specifically includes reinstatement as an appropriate judicial remedy; indeed, “reinstatement is the preferred remedy in the absence of special circumstances militating against it.” Squires v. Bonser, 54 F.3d 168, 173 (3d Cir.1995). Although there is evidence of prior antagonism between plaintiff and the individuals with whom he would have to work, defendant may not justify denying plaintiff the promotion based on hostility engendered by the employer’s own acts of discrimination or by this litigation itself. See Lander v. Lujan, 888 F.2d at 158. Since the jury concluded that plaintiff was qualified for and should have been selected for the job and that he was denied it only because of illegal discrimination and retaliation, plaintiff should not be further penalized for the workplace discord that may have arisen from defendant’s own discriminatory activity. The Court must assume that, if awarded the job, plaintiff will carry out his responsibilities professionally and without rancor and that plaintiff and defendant alike will actively seek to promote and sustain the sort of respectful workplace relationships envisioned by Title VII itself.
As for the fact that retroactively appointing plaintiff to the position of Division Director would “bump” Barbara Twombly, who currently is “acting” in that position, the District of Columbia Circuit has indicated that bumping is authorized and appropriate in precisely the kind of situation presented by this case. Lander v. Lujan, 888 F.2d at 156-58. For these reasons, the Court will order the retroactive appointment of plaintiff to the position of Director of the Division of Acquisition Management.
The parties agree that, in light of the jury’s verdict, the plaintiff is entitled to retroactive promotion to a GS-15 Level, Step 6. They differ only as to whether he should be promoted to that level as of June 10, 1992, the date on which Robert Stovenour, the recommending official, formally recommended Barbara Twombly for the position of Division Director, or as of August 9, 1992, the beginning of the first pay period after Laurence Love, the selecting official, approved the recommendation of Ms. Twombly by Mr. Stovenour. Based on the representations of the government and the declaration of Sylvia Vela, dated March 12, 1996, the Court concludes that plaintiff is entitled to retroactive promotion to the GS-15 Level, Step 6, as of August 9, 1992, not as of June 10, 1992.
The parties also are in agreement that, in view of the jury’s verdict, plaintiff is entitled to back pay and other benefits, with interest, for the pay differential between what he earned as a GS-14, Step 10, and a GS-15, Step 6, and that he should receive the appropriate bonuses and step increases, if any, attendant with the promotion to Division Director. The only point of disagreement is whether plaintiffs benefits should be calculated based on the assumption that he would have performed at the “outstanding” level as Division Director or only at a “fully successful” level, his most recent performance rating. Because plaintiff has never been a Division Director, there is no direct evidence about how plaintiff would have performed in that position. There is evidence, however, that his most recent performance evaluation was only a “fully successful” rating, and plaintiff testified at trial that he did not contest this rating. Based on the trial testimony, the Court concludes that it would be more appropriate to calculate plaintiffs back pay and other benefits as if plaintiff had received a “fully successful” rating rather than an “outstanding” rating. Thus, the back pay and benefits shall be calculated as if he had received a “fully successful” rating from August 10, 1992 until the present time.
B. Recrediting Annual Leave and Sick Leave
Plaintiff argues that Mr. Hayes was forced to use both sick leave and annual leave “to get treatment and to maintain his equilibrium” because of the “retaliatory campaign” waged against him by Barbara Twombly. He maintains that he was forced to use 405.5 hours of sick leave and 447.8 hours of annual leave between March of 1993, when the “retaliatory campaign against him seems to have started,” and the trial of this case that began on November 29, 1995. He also argues that because of this retaliatory treatment he was “forced to conserve what little leave he had left” and thus took 40 hours of leave without pay in order to take his sons on vacation. He therefore seeks payment for this week of leave without pay, in addition to the re-crediting of annual and sick leave. All of these requests are premised on the jury having found by a preponderance of the evidence that Barbara Twombly intentionally retaliated against plaintiff because of his EEO complaint regarding his non-selection for the Division Director position.
The jury found that Ms. Twombly’s retaliatory actions caused Mr. Hayes to suffer “emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, or loss of enjoyment of life so as to entitle him to monetary compensation over and above back pay” and awarded him $50,000 in compensation. The jury also compensated plaintiff for the humiliation, emotional pain and suffering, inconvenience and mental anguish that he suffered by virtue of the discrimination and retaliation that led to his non-selection for the position of Division Director. This jury award of $150,-000 more than compensates and makes plaintiff whole for these emotional injuries. The fact that he allegedly had to take leave to visit his psychotherapist and to otherwise absent himself from the workplace because of the work environment which he found intolerable necessarily was considered by the jury as evidence in support of his claim for compensatory damages and therefore is encompassed by the jury’s verdict. See Shaw v. Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, 666 F.Supp. 1330, 1339 (D.Neb.1987).
It is clear from the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which provided for compensatory damages under Title VII for the first time, that the sort of recovery for emotional distress sought by plaintiff is not available as a form of equitable relief, since before 1991 it was not available under Title VII at all. In explaining why Congress added compensatory damages, the House Report reasoned that
[v]ictims of intentional ... discrimination ... often endure terrible humiliation, pain and suffering. This distress often manifests itself in emotional disorders and medical problems. [Yet without compensatory damages] [v]ietims of discrimination often suffer substantial out-of-pocket expenses as a result of the discrimination, none of which is compensable with equitable remedies. The limitation of relief under Title VII to equitable remedies often means that victims of intentional discrimination may not recover for the very real effects of the discrimination.
H.R.Rep. No. 102-40, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 2 pt. 2, at 25 (1991), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1991 at 694, 718.
Moreover, equitable relief is not automatic and the Court must assess the appropriateness of the equitable relief sought in light of the injuries found. Where the jury has not actually decided an issue or where the basis for the jury’s decision cannot be determined, the court is not bound. Blake v. Hall, 668 F.2d 52, 54 (1st Cir.1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 983, 102 S.Ct. 2257, 72 L.Ed.2d 862 (1982). Here, the jury expressly found that Ms. Twombly refused to allow plaintiff to accrue and use credit hours to work out at the gym during an extended lunch hour every day and in so doing unlawfully retaliated against him. The government has conceded that plaintiff is entitled to 44.5 hours of annual leave for this time. The jury also expressly found that Ms. Twombly retaliated against plaintiff by charging him with one hour of Absent Without Leave (AWOL); plaintiff therefore is entitled to recover this hour.
The jury’s other findings, however, do not demonstrate that plaintiff is entitled to be credited with the large amount of leave he took allegedly to improve his mental health. The jury found that Ms. Twombly retaliated against plaintiff by rating him only at the “fully successful” level, by requiring him to submit a work plan before she would approve his annual leave, by denying his request for annual leave, by investigating a complaint against him, by reprimanding him and by verbally abusing him. These actions have, at best, a highly attenuated connection to plaintiffs decision to take over 850 hours of sick leave and annual leave. Plaintiffs unilateral decision to absent himself from the workplace does not entitle him to the equitable relief he seeks either in the Court’s view or, so far as can be discerned, in the jury’s. For these same reasons, the 40 hours of leave that plaintiff took without pay is also not compensable because plaintiff has failed to demonstrate, and the jury did not find, that his leave taking resulted from defendant’s unlawful conduct.
C. Injunction Prohibiting Discrimination and Retaliation and Correction of Records
An injunction prohibiting discrimination and retaliation in this case is both unnecessary and inappropriate. The jury verdict is sufficient in and of itself to protect plaintiff against future acts of discrimination and retaliation. The Court will not presume that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and her employees will not follow the law and plaintiff has not demonstrated that future violations are likely. See E.E.O.C. v. General Lines, Inc., 865 F.2d 1555, 1565 (10th Cir.1989). No injunction will be issued.
Regarding the request for correction of records, the Court will order that Mr. Hayes’ personnel folder and other relevant Department records be corrected to reflect the jury’s verdict and the equitable relief provided by the Court.
