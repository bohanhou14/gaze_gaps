DETECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''
You are a trained lawyer from Silicon Valley with a computer science background. Now, you are asked to annotate legal analysis generated by large language models and classify the errors and mismatch made by these models. To produce these legal analysis, a language model will receive the following prompt:

Here are some reference articles for legal cases: 
# Reference case {case_key_1}
{text of cited case 1} 
# Reference case {case_key_2}
{text of cited case 2}
...
# Reference case {case_key_N} {text of cited case N}
Here is the text I’ve written so far: # Paragrah
{previous_text}
Continue to write it following the style of my writeup. Your answer contains 100 to 400 words. You must explicitly use the reference cases and mention their reference ids, i.e. {case_key_1}, {case_key_2} . . . {case_key_N}. Wrap your answer with <answer></answer>. Make your answer concise and avoid redundant languages.

Receiving the prompt above, a language model will generate a paragraph of legal analysis, but often times they make different kinds of errors and mismatches. 

The instructions for you to classify these errors and mismatches are as follows:

You should classify the LLM-generated legal analysis to these categories:

1. Intrinsic gap:
This category refers to generation that is unacceptable, due to the language model has fundamentally failed to follow the instruction, or make a lot of redundancy, or generate something that does not look like legal text (structural mismatch). More specificially, if it makes one or more of the following:

- Redundancy (sentence-level, appearing as neural degeneration): the generation appears to make repetitive statements that do not add more meaning to the analysis. For example, multiple occurences of an exact sentence or phrase.
- Citation Format Mismatch: the generation appears not matching with the citation format of the standard Bluebook.
    - Please be aware that, for example, 440 U.S. 48, 55' is a proper format. Although its full citation should be 'Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979)', the format '440 U.S. 48, 55' is still acceptable as a concise form.
- Structural Mismatch: the generation appears to generate the document from scratch (like containing words such as "ORDER" which only appear in the beginning).
- Stylistic Mismatch: contain sentences that do not match the styles of legalese.

If this type of gaps is present, add the label `1`. Continue to item 2.

Side note: You should be able to classify this purely based on the generation itself, without having to look at cited examples.

2. Target mismatch:

While language model's generated text may be obviously wrong and substantively different from the target (i.e. the original/target text from the case), the claims it makes are still logically and factually sound and can be seen as acceptable. This could be because
 - Chain Cite: the citations appear in a chain cite but the generation cites them parallely, or the other way around.
 - Reverse Cite: the citations reverse the ruling in each other but the generation cites them parallely, or the other way around.
 - Compound Cite: the citations of different cases are cited together, separated by semicolons, or the other way around.
 
 Although it does not match with the target, it is still considered somewhat acceptable, but we should label it out.

 If this type of mismatch is present add the label `2`. Continue to item 3.

3. Citation Mismatch: The language model's generated text does not align with the content of the citation it points to. This might be because one or more of the following:

- Claim Hallucination: the claim supported by the citation is not truthful or not related to the context or from cited paragraphs or the previous context. The generated text makes different and possibly (although not necessarily) contradictory claims about one or more citations, which you can check from comparing to the reference case. Or, the generated text attributes information from one citation to a different citation.
- Retrieval Inaccuracy: the claims supported by the citation is not relevant because the cited paragraph looks irrelevant compared to the target paragraph. 
- Citation Hallucination: the citation is non-existent or pulled from a citation in the cited paragraphs or the previous context, or there misses a citation (the generated text fails to use one of the citations that were given to it).

If this type of mismatch is **present**, add the label `3` and move on to the next example. If none of the above errors are present, label '0'.

Here are some examples for demonstration:

II. The Regulation is Not Arbitrary and Capricious Treasury's regulation must also survive scrutiny
under the arbitrary and capricious standard as outlined in the State Farm case. A regulation will
meet this standard if the agency has provided a rational connection between the facts found and the
choices made. In assessing this, we examine whether Treasury considered the relevant factors and
articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action, see Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass’n of the
United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856,
77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). In our assessment of Treasury’s regulation defining "present value," we look
to analogous cases to guide our interpretation. For example, in Gresham v. Commissioner, 79 T.C. 322
(1982), the Tax Court invalidated a regulation that inadequately accounted for market restrictions
impacting stock value, a decision maintained on appeal (752 F.2d 518). This exemplifies that
regulatory definitions must align closely with realistic economic conditions affecting taxpayers.
The Balestras argue that failing to consider an employer’s bankruptcy contravenes realistic
valuation tactics similarly to how disregarding securities restrictions failed in Gresham (764 F.2d
322). However, Treasury’s choice to exclude bankruptcy contingencies aims to maintain a general and
practical approach, ensuring a stable and predictable tax base without the need for intricate and
variable financial health assessments. We conclude that Treasury has adequately justified its
regulation within the permissible bounds of its authority. Consequently, the regulation is neither
arbitrary nor capricious, but instead aligns with established legal principles and regulatory
practices.

The Balestras rely on both cases, but these out-of-circuit cases are neither binding nor persuasive. Both cases involve the
invalidation of a Treasury regulation when the related statute explicitly required consideration of
fair market value. The statute in this case never references “fair market value.” Moreover, in this
instance, there is no unambiguous intent or purpose requiring such a valuation.

applied by this regulation to the section 57(a)(6) computation, for purposes of the section 56 minimum tax, of the item of tax preference, arising from the exercise of a qualified stock option. Appellees petitioned the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiencies asserted by the Commissioner. That court characterized the case as containing a “sole issue for decision ... whether certain Federal securities law restrictions imposed on the transfer of common stock received by an employee upon the exercise of a qualified stock option should be considered in determining the fair market value of the stock for purposes of the minimum tax computation.” McDonald v. Commissioner, No. 1983-197 (T.C. April 11, 1983), at 6. The Tax Court ruled in favor of the McDonalds. It felt itself bound by its prior decision in Gresham v. Commissioner, 79 T.C. 322 (1982), aff'd, 752 F.2d 518 (10th Cir.1985), which held Reg. section 1.57-l(f)(3) invalid, and specified that, for minimum tax purposes, similar lapsing restrictions on the transferability of stock acquired by exercise of a qualified stock option may not be wholly disregarded in determining the stock’s fair market value when so acquired. The Commissioner appeals to this Court. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK The Minimum Tax Section 56 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted as a part of the Tax Reform Act of 1969. As enacted and as in effect in 1972, it imposed a so-called minimum tax on certain “items of tax preference, listed in IRC section 57. Section 56 levied a

a period of two years, unless a registration statement was in effect with respect to the shares. (As stated earlier, no such statement was in effect on the dates of issuance of taxpayer’s shares.) In any private placement of the option stock, the SEC would also have required the purchaser to execute a similar investment letter. During the years in question, taxpayer calculated his minimum tax liability by first determining the bid prices for GEC stock traded on the over-the-counter market on the dates he exercised the option and then discounting the total value of each block of shares purchased by 33(4 percent, reporting this discounted value as the “fair market value” of the shares so acquired. (This discounted value represented the value taxpayer would receive if he sold the shares in a private placement.) Taxpayer then subtracted from this discounted value his cost for the option shares; this amount taxpayer reported as his tax preference income. In determining deficiencies for the years 1975 and 1976, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) valued the option shares using the over-the-counter, rather than the private placement, value of the shares. The Commissioner thus ignored the effect of the investment letter restrictions on the basis of Treas.Reg. § 1.57-l(f)(3). The parties stipulated that if section 1.57-l(f)(3) is valid and applicable, taxpayer will concede the deficiencies as assessed in the statutory notice. Conversely, they have stipulated that if, as the Tax Court concluded, section 1.57-l(f)(3) is invalid or inapplicable, the fair market value of

Introduction
This is a tax refund case. The Balestras seek &• refund of $3,285.26 for Federal Insurance Contribution Act (“FICA”) tax paid on certain deferred compensation— retirement benefits in this case — that Mr. Balestra will never receive due to his employer’s bankruptcy proceedings.
The tax was based on a calculation of the “amount deferred” under 26 U.S.C. § 3121(v)(2)(A) (2000). Congress did not define the phrase “amount deferred.” Instead, the Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) promulgated a regulation defining the “amount deferred” in terms of the deferred compensation’s “present value.” This definition prohibited any consideration of an employer’s financial condition (e.g., bankruptcy) in calculating the amount deferred. See 26 C.F.R. § 31.312'l(v)(2)-l(c)(2)(ii).
The Balestras challenge this regulation as inconsistent with the statute, citing the analysis required by Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). They also contend that the regulation is arbitrary and capricious under Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass’n of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983).
After exhausting their administrative remedies before the Internal Revenue Service, they brought suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims seeking a refund of the taxes paid. When the trial court denied them a remedy, they brought this appeal.
BACKGROUND
A.
FICA tax includes both the social security tax and the hospital insurance tax. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 3101(a)-(b). This case concerns FICA tax and the hospital insurance tax in particular. The hospital insurance tax is imposed on every individual’s income. Id. § 3101(b). The tax is collected by a withholding mechanism. Id. § 3102(a). The taxpayer’s employer collects and remits the tax due by deducting the amount of the tax from the employee’s wages as and when paid. Id.
For the relevant 2004 tax year, the hospital insurance tax was 1.45% of an individual’s “wages” received with respect to employment. Id. § 3101(b)(6); 26 C.F.R. § 31.3101-2(c). “Wages” are defined in 26 U.S.C. § 3121(a) and include the deferred compensation at issue. On appeal, the parties do not dispute this fact.
A critical question is when the wages are received.
Generally, wages are received when they are paid by the employer to the employee, and wages are paid by the employer when they are actually or constructively paid. 26 C.F.R. § 31.3121(a)-2. The same rule is • generally true for FICA tax purposes. Id. § 31.3121(v)(2)-l(a)(l).
However, some wages — including the deferred compensation at issue here — are treated differently under the “special timing rule” for FICA tax purposes. Id. § 31.3121(v)(2)-l(a)(2). This special timing rule only applies to wages under 26 U.S.C. § 3121(a) if those wages are from a “nonqualified deferred compensation plan” as described in 26 C.F.R. § 31.3121(v)(2)-1(b). Id. Both Congress and Treasury define “nonqualified deferred compensation plan.” See 26 U.S.C. § 3121(v)(2)(C) (Congress’s definition); 26 C.F.R. § 31.3121(v)(2)-l(b) (Treasury’s definition). The parties agree that the plan at issue is such a plan.
With respect to nonqualified deferred compensation plans, Congress provided that:
Any amount deferred pnder a nonquali-fied deferred compensation plan shall be taken into account for purposes of this chapter as of the later of — (i) when the services are performed, or (ii) when there is no substantial risk of forfeiture of the rights to such amount.
26 U.S.C. § 3121(v)(2)(A) (emphasis added).
Some nonqualified deferred compensation plans — including the plan at issue— are also “nonaccount balance plans” as described in 26 C.F.R. § 31.3121(v)(2)-1(c)(2). For such plans, Treasury defined an “amount deferred” in terms- of the t “present value” of the deferred compensation (the future payments). 26 C.F.R. § 31.3121(v)(2)-l(c)(2)(i).
Treasury defined “present value” in this context:
For purposes of this section, present value means the value as of a specified date of an amount or series of amounts due thereafter, where each amount is multiplied by the probability that the condition or conditions on which pay ment of the amount is contingent will be satisfied, and is discounted according to an assumed rate of interest to reflect the time value of money. For purposes of this section, the present value must be determined as of the date the amount deferred is required to be taken into account as wages under paragraph (e) of this section using actuarial assumptions and methods that are reasonable as of that date. For this purpose, a discount for the probability that an employee will die before commencement of benefit payments is permitted, but only to the extent that benefits will be forfeited upon death. In addition, the present value cannot be discounted for the probability that payments will not be made (or will be reduced) because of the unfunded status of the plan, the risk associated with any deemed or actual investment of amounts deferred under the plan, the risk that the employer, the trustee, or another party will be unwilling or unable to pay, the possibility of future plan amendments, the possibility of a future change in the law, or similar risks or contingencies. Nor is the present value affected by the possibility that some of the payments due under the plan will be eligible for one of the exclusions from wages in section 3121(a).
Id. § 31.3121(v)(2)-l(c)(2)(ii) (emphasis added).
B.
As a result of this statutory and regulatory background, the Balestras effectively paid FICA tax on wages they will never receive.
Mr. Balestra was employed as a pilot by United Airlines (“United”) from January 29, 1979 until his retirement on October 1, 2004. Upon retirement, Mr. Balestra was eligible to receive retirement benefits through a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that was also a nonaccount balance plan. He was to receive, inter alia, continuing payments for the rest of his life. He elected to start his benefits effective the day of his retirement. United, as his employer, therefore withheld hospital insurance tax from Mr. Balestra in the 2004 tax .year. Mr. and Mrs. Bales-tra filed a joint return for that tax year.
The tax withheld by United was based on the then-applicable 1.45% statutory tax rate applied to the present value of the deferred compensation that Mr. Balestra was to receive under the plan. In compliance with the statute and regulation at issue, United calculated the present value of the deferred compensation to be $289,601.18. United therefore withheld 1.45% of this amount ($4,199.22) in hospital insurance tax from Mr. Balestra.
United was set to pay Mr. Balestra retirement benefits for the duration of his life. However, United had entered bankruptcy proceedings in 2002, and its obligations to pay these benefits were eventually discharged in those proceedings. United ceased paying benefits to Mr. Ba-lestra in 2010.
As a result, Mr. Balestra actually received only $63,032.09 in benefits, even though he effectively (through his employer’s withholding) paid a hospital tax based on $289,601.18 in benefits. Since the Ba-lestras filed a joint tax return in 2004, they seek a refund of $3,285.26 — the amount of tax paid on compensation they will never receive.
In May 2007, the Balestras filed an administrative claim before Treasury requesting a refund of the tax paid. That claim was denied.
In May 2009, the Balestras filed the present action for a refund in the United States Court of Federal Claims (“trial court”). The trial court 'granted the Government’s motion for summary judgment and denied the Balestras’ cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court determined, inter alia, that the regulation at issue, ' 37 C.F.R. § 3121 (v)(2)-l(c)(2)(ii), satisfies Chevron and State Farm. The trial court also denied as moot the Government’s motion to amend the answer to add a defense.
The Balestras timely appealed. Before this court, they argue that the regulation does not satisfy Chevron or State Farm. They contend that under the terms of the governing statute, the regulation is invalid or inapplicable to their situation because United was in bankruptcy proceedings when the deferred compensation’s present value was calculated. They also contend that the regulation is arbitrary and capricious because it departs from the plain meaning of “present value” without a sufficient explanation.
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(3).
Discussion
We review the trial court’s grant of summary judgment without deference. Consolidation Coal Co. v. United States, 615 F.3d 1378, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2010). The trial court was bound by the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (“RCFC”). Under those rules, summary judgment is proper “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” RCFC 56(a). We review the court’s denial of a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion. Shinnecock Indian Nation v. United States, 782 F.3d 1345, 1348 (Fed.Cir.2015).
We agree with the Balestras that, regarding an agency with rulemaking authority such as Treasury, we review the agency’s regulatory interpretation of a statute it administers under the Supreme Court’s guidance in Chevron. See Mayo Found. for Med. Educ. & Research v. United States, 562 U.S. 44, 52-58, 131 S.Ct. 704, 178 L.Ed.2d 588 (2011); Dominion Res., Inc. v. United States, 681 F.3d 1313, 1317 (Fed.Cir.2012). We evaluate . the agency’s explanation for its action under State Farm to determine if it is arbitrary or capricious. , Mayo, 562 U.S. at 52-58, 131 S.Ct. 704; Dominion, 681 F.3d at 1317.
I.
Treasury’s Regulation Satisfies Chevron
Under the Chevron framework, we begin by using the ordinary tools of statu-
tory construction to determine whether Congress’s intent is clear regarding the precise question at issue. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43, 843 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778; City of Arlington v. F.C.C., — U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1863, 1868, — L.Ed.2d - (2013). These tools include the statute’s text and structure, canons of statutory construction, and legislative history. Gilead Sois., Inc. v. Lee, 778 F.3d 1341, 1348 (Fed.Cir.2015).
If Congress’s intent is clear,, then we give effect to Congress’s unambiguously expressed intent. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. However, if that intent is not clear, then we determine whether the agency’s interpretation of the statute is a reasonable one. Id. at 842^44, 104 S.Ct. 2778. “If Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.” Id. at 843^44, 104 S.Ct. 2778. We afford such legislative regulations “controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.” Id. at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (footnote omitted). If the legislative delegation is implicit, then a court “may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.” Id. (footnote omitted).
A.
In determining whether Chevron deference is owed in this instance, we begin with the language of the statute and the ordinary tools of statutory construction to determine whether Congress directly addressed the precise question at issue. See, e.g., Gilead Scis., 778 F.3d at 1347.
The parties do not dispute the formulation of the question. The question is how employers must calculate the “amount deferred” under nonqualified deferred compensation plans that are also nonaccount balance plans for the purposes of FICA (hospital insurance) tax, and, more pointedly, whether the “amount deferred” can be defined as the compensation’s “present value” without consideration of an employer’s financial condition.
The relevant statute provides that:
Any amount deferred under a nonquali-fied deferred compensation plan shall be taken into account for purposes of this chapter as of the later of — (i) when the services are performed, or (ii) when there is no substantial risk of forfeiture of the rights to such amount.
26 U.S.C. § 3121(v)(2)(A) (emphasis added).
Neither the statute nor the ordinary tools of statutory construction reveal any clear, unambiguously expressed congressional intent on the precise question at issue.
The statute does not contain a definition of the “amount deferred” or reference any way to calculate such an amount — including by determining its “present value,” with or without considering an employer’s financial condition.
The statute was enacted as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1983, Pub.L. 98-21, 97 Stat. 65, 122 (1983) (“Act”). As a bill, it was considered and passed in the House of Representatives before being considered, amended, and passed in the Senate. See 97 Stat. at 172. The House and Senate then agreed to a conference report. Id.
One of the Senate amendments contained the provision that became the statute at issue in this case. See 129 Cong. Rec. S6133-35 (daily ed. Mar. 18, 1983); H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 98-47, at 145-47 (1983) (comparing the House and Senate versions of the bill and describing the conference agreement). The conference agreement “generally follow[ed]” that amendment. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 98-47, at 147.
Senator Bentsen introduced the amendment, and he. made several statements concerning it. The Balestras cite these statements as legislative history indicating Congress’s intent to impose FICA tax on the compensation’s “present value” in its plain and ordinary sense as used in other parts, of the tax code. According to the Balestras, Congress intended that the “present value” be calculated according to the “fair market value” of the compensation as understood from a “willing buyer-willing seller” model.
However, Senator Bentsen’s statements do not support the Balestras’ conclusions. Senator Bentsen stated that:
In most cases, under nonqualified deferred compensation agreements it is a relatively simple matter to determine when amounts are deferred and the amount that is being deferred. Likewise, as in many other areas of our tax law, simple rules can be established to determine the present value of amounts deferred in other cases.
129 Cong. Rec. S6134.
When read in light of the House Conference Report, these statements indicate that Senator Bentsen, and presumably the Senate and Congress, intended to define the “amount deferred” in terms of the compensation’s “present value.” Neither party argues that Treasury’s defining “amount deferred” in terms of “present value” itself was improper. Instead, they argue over the precise and proper meaning of “present value.”
However, these statements do not evince an unambiguous congressional intent that the “present value” calculation must consider an employer’s financial status. Similarly, there is nothing to indicate that “present value” is to be calculated specifically in terms of “fair market value” or the “willing buyer-willing seller” standard.
The senator’s statements merely suggest that simple rules can be established. In other words, this legislative history actually supports Treasury’s regulation — a relatively simple rule that the Balestras simply dislike.
We find no other legislative history, canon of construction, or salient feature of statutory structure that points to any unambiguous congressional intent on the issue. The parties, for their part, do not suggest any.
B.
Since there is no unambiguous expression of congressional intent, we pro ceed to the second step of the Chevron framework. We must determine whether Treasury’s interpretation of the statute is a reasonable one. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778.
Treasury was faced with a statutory ambiguity — how to define the “amount deferred.” Treasury devised the regulation to be workable, simple, and flexible. See 61 Fed.Reg. at 2195; 64 Fed.Reg. at 4543. Agencies must draw such lines and make such choices between alternatives in drafting regulations. See Mayo, 562 U.S. at 58-59, 131 S.Ct. 704.
Treasury chose to define the “amount deferred” in terms of “present value.” 26 C.F.R. § 31.3121(v)(2)-l(c)(2)(ii). Treasury further chose to define “present value” by considering, inter alia, the time value of money and reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods at the time the amount deferred was taken into account as wages. Id. The exact value of a future payment is inherently unknowable. Treasury’s definition allowed for the consideration of some contingencies but not others.
As a matter of law, was Treasury obligated to include the contingency that if the employer became bankrupt, an adjustment in the employee’s tax would be made? It would seem reasonable for the rule drafters to have done so. But the question under Chevron is whether it was unreasonable not to have done so.
The regulation as written would seem to comport with the scant legislative history. Nothing in the statute or congressional purpose, intent, or design precludes Treasury’s definition. The definition is rational, reasonable, and does not conflict with any law.
As noted, the regulation comports with the scant legislative history relied upon by the Balestras. Senator Bentsen noted that in “most cases” it was “relatively simple” to determine the amount deferred. 129 Cong. Rec. S6134. He spoke of the “simple rules [that] can be established.” Id. Treasury promulgated a simple and reasonable rule. We decline to substitute our own regulation in place of the reasonable one that Treasury devised in this instance.
The Balestras’ arguments on this point are unpersuasive. They admit that the statute is silent on the question at issue. They admit that the regulation “may well be a reasonable interpretation of the statute” when applied to employers who are not in bankruptcy. Appellants’ Br. at 41. However, they argue that the regulation is unreasonable as applied to employers in bankruptcy. They believe that the legislative history and purpose of the statute demonstrate Congress’s intent to tax the present value of deferred compensation only in terms of its fair market value— measured by a willing buyer-willing seller standard as in United States v. Cartmight, 411 U.S. 546, 93 S.Ct. 1713, 36 L.Ed.2d 528 (1973). Based on Cartwright, the Balestras argue that any Treasury regulation with a valuation method must result in “a realistic valúe that does not vary significantly from the willing buyer-willing seller standard.” Appellants’ Br. at 47. Any regulation deviating from this standard is — in their words — invalid.
This is not so. First, as previously discussed, the legislative history and purpose of the statute do not indicate that Congress intended to define the “amount deferred” as the compensation’s “present value” in terms of its “fair market value” under a willing buyer-willing seller standard or by necessitating an evaluation of an employer’s financial condition and its ability to make future payments. The Ba-lestras’ argument hinges upon the statements of Senator Bentsen. They reason that by referencing simple rules in place in other sections of the tax code, Senator Bentsen and all of Congress intended that Treasury abide by the willing buyer-willing seller standard. As we have already discussed, the record does not support this reading.
Second, the Balestras read the import of Cartwright too broadly. Cartwright was a pre-Chevron case that dealt with fair market value and the willing buyer-willing seller standard in the context of the particular statute and regulation at issue in that case. Cartwright involved a Treasury regulation relating to 26 U.S.C. § 2031. This statute concerned the value of a decedent’s property for estate tax purposes. The regulation required Treasury to value mutual fund shares at their “fair market value”— which Treasury defined as the public offering or asking price of mutual fund shares — instead of the lower redemption price (the actual price for which someone could have redeemed the shares). Cartwright, 411 U.S. at 549 n. 5, 93 S.Ct. 1713 (quoting the relevant portion of 26 C.F.R. § 20.2031-8(b)).
Treasury promulgated that regulation despite having previously stated — in the context of the same statute — that the “fair market value” was the “ ‘price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.’ ” Id. at 551, 93 S.Ct. 1713 (quoting 26 C.F.R. § 20.2031-l(b)). In other words, fair market value was at issue because of the particular statute and regulation in the case. It is true that the Court stated the “willing buyer-willing seller test of fair market value is nearly as old as the federal income, estate, and gift taxes themselves, and is not challenged here.” Id. at 551, 551 n. 7, 93 S.Ct. 1713 (citing a separate Treasury regulation specifically relating to the test in the context of estate tax). However, this statement does not compel the result sought by the Balestras in this case.
The Court in Cartwright ultimately found that the regulation was “manifestly inconsistent with the most elementary provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 [which regulated the mutual funds] and operate[d] without regard for the market in mutual fund shares that the Act created and regulates.” Id. at 557, 93 S.Ct. 1713. The Court stated that Congress “surely could not have intended” such a statutory interpretation. Id. Moreover, the Court determined that the regulation imposed an “unreasonable and unrealistic measure of value.” Id. Treasury treated load and no-load mutual funds differently, and in seeking the higher valuation, Treasury ignored its own definition of “fair market value.” See id. at 556-57, 93 S.Ct. 1713. This case involves no such contravention of the statute or the Social Security Amendments of 1983. As previously noted, this case also involves no such congressional intent on the question of “fair market value.”
The Balestras’ other arguments are similarly unpersuasive. For instance, the Balestras cite several Treasury regulations relating to other sections of the tax code and numerous cases involving the willing buyer-willing seller standard and the general meaning of present value. However, without a clear indication of congressional intent on this issue (that Congress intended to keep these standards in this instance), their arguments are not persuasive. Section 3121 simply does not concern these other standards found in other areas of tax law. We may not import those standards into the statute or the regulation here.

However, it should be noted that the issue of a confession's voluntariness cannot be lightly
disregarded. In reference to case 373 U.S. 503, the Supreme Court has emphasized that when a Fifth
Amendment violation, such as a coerced confession, is alleged, it must be the subject of an
independent determination. This means that state court determinations regarding the voluntariness of confessions must be critically examined to ensure adherence to constitutional protections.
Additionally, as demonstrated in case 378 U.S. 368, the resolution of disputes concerning the
conditions under which a confession was obtained is crucial. The facts surrounding Tucker’s alleged
waiver and subsequent confession require a reliable adjudication to ascertain whether undue coercion or threats influenced his statements, thus questioning the voluntariness of the confession.
Moreover, drawing from case 361 U.S. 199, we understand that mental coercion, akin to physical
coercion, can render a confession involuntary. The claims of threats and deception raised by
Tucker's counsel necessitate thorough scrutiny. If indeed his confession was influenced by such
coercive tactics, it would grievously breach the Fourteenth Amendment, necessitating exclusion from evidence. Thus, while the overwhelming evidence against Tucker potentially renders any
constitutional error harmless, a rigorous examination of the circumstances surrounding his
confession remains essential to uphold the integrity of constitutional rights.

Consequently, the general statement in Payne v. Arkansas which we have quoted, supra, applicable there, is obviously inapplicable here. Even if Tucker’s allegations of improper officer conduct could be substantiated and his confession were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights, a reversal of the conviction and a remand for a new trial would be an act of complete futility. Without the evidence of the confession and of the recovered loot appellant’s guilt was overwhelmingly proved by other clearly constitutionally admissible evidence.

which should provide it. This is not a case where the facts concerning the circumstances surrounding the confession are undisputed and the task is only to judge the voluntariness of the confession based upon the clearly established facts and in accordance with proper constitutional standards. Here there are substantial facts in dispute: Jackson said that he was in pain from his wounds, gasping for breath and unable to talk long. A state witness described Jackson as in strong condition despite his wounds. According to Jackson, the police told him he could have no water and would not be left alone until he gave the answers the authorities desired. These verbal threats were denied by the State. Whereas Jackson claimed his will was affected by the drugs administered to him, the State’s evidence was that the drugs neither had nor could have had any effect upon him at all. Whether Jackson is entitled to relief depends upon how these facts are resolved, for if the State is to be believed we cannot say that Jackson’s confession was involuntary, whereas if Jackson’s version of the facts is accepted the confession was involuntary and inadmissible. As we have already said, Jackson is entitled to a reliable resolution of these evidentiary conflicts. If this case were here upon direct review of Jackson’s conviction, we could not proceed with review on the assumption that these disputes had been resolved in favor of the State for as we have held we are not only unable to

Amendment has been violated by admission into evidence of a coerced confession be the subject of an independent determination here, see, e. g., Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143, 147-148; “we cannot escape the responsibility of making our own examination of the record,” Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 316. While, for purposes of review in this Court, the determination of the trial judge or of the jury will ordinarily be taken to resolve evidentiary conflicts and may be entitled to some weight even with. respect to the ultimate conclusion on the crucial issue of voluntariness, we cannot avoid our re sponsibilities by permitting ourselves to be “completely bound by state court determination of any issue essential to decision of a claim of federal right, else federal law could be frustrated by distorted fact finding.” Stein v. New York, 346 U. S. 156, 181. As state courts are, in instances such as this, charged with the primary responsibility of protecting basic and essential rights, we accord an appropriate and substantial effect to their resolutions of conflicts in evidence as to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of factual events and happenings. This is particularly apposite because the trial judge and jury are closest to the trial scene- and thus afforded the best opportunity to evaluate contradictory testimony. But, as declared in Ward v. Texas, 316 U. S. 547, 550, “when, as in this case, the question is properly raised as to whether a defendant has been denied the due

stated he .had been released, and avowed that Blackburn “talked sensible and give [sic] sensible answers,” was clear-eyed, and did not appear nervous. Blackburn’s counsel again objected to admission of the statement, but the objection was overruled and the confession was submitted to the jury. After the Alabama Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment and held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not require exclusion of the confession, Blackburn petitioned this Court for cer-tiorari. Thus was the constitutional issue raised, decided,, and presented to' this Court for review. After according all of the deference to the trial judge’s decision which is compatible with our duty to determine .constitutional questions, we are unable to escape the-conclusion that Blackburn’s confession can fairly be characterized only as involuntary. Consequently the conviction must be set aside, since this Court, in a line of decisions beginning in 1936 with Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278, and including cases by now too well known and too numerous to bear citation, has established the principle that the Fourteenth Amendment is grievously breached when an involuntary confession is obtained by state officers and introduced into evidence in a criminal prosecution which culminates in a conviction. Since Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227, this Court has recognized that coercion can be mental as well as physical, and that the blood óf the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition. A number of cases have demonstrated, if demonstration were needed, that the efficiency of the rack

previous_text: WATERMAN, Circuit Judge:
After a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York appellant Albert Tucker was convicted on April 15, 1968 upon two counts of bank robbery, one armed and one unarmed. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. He appeals from the conviction on the ground that a confession was obtained from him in violation of his Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights, and the confession and the fruits thereof were erroneously admitted into evidence against him at the trial. We hold that the alleged error, if indeed error, was a constitutionally harmless error, and we affirm the judgment of conviction entered below.
On the morning of November 30, 1967, three men, apparently armed, robbed the Bankers* Trust Company in Mas-peth, Long Island. Almost immediately after the three men entered the bank hidden movie cameras were activated by one of the tellers and also by the bank manager. The three robbers took $22,-600.00 in cash from behind the tellers’ counters and then fled.
Five days later a Commissioner’s warrant was issued for the arrest of Albert Tucker for his participation in the robbery. In the afternoon of the next day appellant was arrested pursuant to this warrant. A participant in the robbery with Tucker, David Jones, had already confessed and implicated him and another man, Joseph Bostic, in the robbery.
Tucker was arrested at his home and was then taken to FBI headquarters in a government automobile. The arrest ing agent testified that he advised Tucker of his Miranda rights while en route. At headquarters Tucker was photographed, fingerprinted and processed for about twenty minutes and was then put in an interview room with two federal agents and a Queens County District Attorney’s Squad Detective who had participated in the arrest. One agent read to Tucker the standard “Advice of Rights” form used by the FBI to advise all defendants of their constitutional rights. The accused then read the form himself and allegedly stated that he understood his rights. One agent asked Tucker whether he would sign the waiver at the bottom of the standard form and Tucker signed.
After approximately an hour and a half of interrogation Tucker confessed to having been one of the three men who robbed the Bankers Trust Company. The confession was reduced to writing and he signed the transcription. Thereafter the officers and Tucker had dinner, following which Tucker took an agent to a house in the Bronx where some of the bank loot was stored.
At appellant’s trial photographs taken by the bank’s hidden movie cameras were introduced into evidence by the Government and one of these photographs showed Albert Tucker in the act of robbing the bank. Also, at the trial a bank employee positively identified Tucker as one of the robbers, and Tucker’s robber companions, Jones and Bostic, testified against him.
A hearing was held outside the presence of the jury in order to determine the admissibility of Tucker’s confession. From the testimony then adduced the trial judge concluded that Tucker “was fully advised of his Constitutional rights, and that the confession was voluntarily and understandably made, and without threats or coercion.” Thereafter, the confession and the money recovered from the Bronx house were introduced into evidence.
Appellant contends that the confession obtained from him by the police was obtained in violation of the McNabb-Mallory rule because he was not promptly brought before a United States Commissioner for arraignment on the charges before the interrogation began; that the waiver form he signed was deceptive and coercive; that he was threatened, tricked and cajoled into incriminating himself; that the interrogating agents ignored his request to consult with an attorney; and that he did not understand his right to have an appointed attorney present during the interrogation. We need not discuss these numerous claims for, even if there is a supportable claim of constitutional error, in view of the particular facts of this case the admission of appellant’s confession was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969).
Aside from the allegedly unconstitutionally obtained confession and the money thereafter recovered from the Bronx house, the overwhelming evidence that established Tucker’s guilt was in the possession of the police, or was known to them, before he was arrested or questioned after the arrest. At trial he was positively identified as one of the bank robbers by a bank employee who was present during the robbery, both of Tucker’s accomplices testified against him and implicated him in the robbery, and the unimpeachable photograph of the robbery taken by the hidden movie camera shows Tucker committing the crime. Here the issue of Tucker’s guilt or innocence was in no way a close question. Unchallenged and unimpeached evidence established guilt. Even without the eyewitness testimony an unimpeachable photograph is sufficient in and of itself to convict Tucker. On these particular facts we have no hesitancy in applying the Chapman rule and in finding that the admission of the allegedly unconstitutionally obtained confession and money, if error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Compare Ruona v. United States, 403 F.2d 215 (9 Cir. 1968) with Pearson v. United States, 389 F.2d 684 (5 Cir. 1968); see Lockett v. United States, 390 F.2d 168 (9 Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 877, 89 S.Ct. 175, 21 L.Ed.2d 149 (1968).
We are not unmindful of the Supreme Court statements to the effect that
* * * even though there may have been sufficient evidence, apart from the coerced confession, to support a judgment of conviction, the admission in evidence, over objection, of the coerced confession vitiates the judgment [of conviction] * * *. Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U.S. 560, 568, 78 S.Ct. 844, 850, 2 L.Ed.2d 975 (1958).

E. Additional Considerations In addressing the plausibility of the Thomases' claims, we are guided
by precedent from the Supreme Court. In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, the court
emphasized that while a complaint must contain enough factual content "to raise a reasonable
expectation that discovery will reveal evidence" of a claim, mere parallel conduct or a bare
assertion of conspiracy is insufficient. This standard, reiterated in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.
662, requires that the factual matter asserted must plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief, and
not merely be consistent with a lawful scenario. Here, the Thomases failed to meet this pleading
standard. Their allegations lacked specific factual detail and relied heavily on conclusory
statements. For instance, the Thomases did not provide evidence that U.S. Bank and the Rubin law
firm’s actions constituted a knowing and intentional publication of false information or that U.S.
Bank qualified as a "debt collector" or "loan servicer" under the FDCPA and RESPA, respectively. As
a result, their claims do not satisfy the plausibility requirement established in Twombly and Iqbal,
thus affirming the district court's dismissal (556 U.S. 662; 550 U.S. 544). AFFIRMED. . We
recognize that pro se pleadings are to be liberally construed. See Tannenbaum v. United States, 148
F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998). . The Thomases also asserted claims for negligence, declaratory
relief, and violations of the Truth in Lending Act, but they do not challenge the dismissal of those
claims.

allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact), see, e. g., Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A, 534 U. S. 506, 508, n. 1 (2002); Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U. S. 319, 327 (1989) (“Rule 12(b)(6) does not countenance ... dismissals based on a judge’s disbelief of a complaint’s factual allegations”); Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 236 (1974) (a well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it appears “that a recovery is very remote and unlikely”). In applying these general standards to a § 1 claim, we hold that stating such a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made. Asking for plausible grounds to infer an agreement does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement. And, of course, a well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of the facts alleged is improbable, and “that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.” Ibid. In identifying facts that are suggestive enough to render a § 1 conspiracy plausible, we have the benefit of the prior rulings and considered views of leading commentators, already quoted, that lawful parallel conduct fails to bespeak unlawful agreement. It makes sense to say, therefore, that an allegation of parallel conduct and a bare assertion of conspiracy will not suffice. Without more, parallel conduct does not

S., at 555 (a court must proceed “on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)”); id., at 556 (“[A] well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of the facts alleged is improbable”); see also Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U. S. 319, 327 (1989) (“Rule 12(b)(6) does not countenance ... dismissals based on a judge’s disbelief of a complaint’s factual allegations”). The sole exception to this rule lies with allegations that are sufficiently fantastic to defy reality as we know it: claims about little green men, or the plaintiff’s recent trip to Pluto, or experiences in time travel. That is not what we have here. Under Twombly, the relevant question is whether, assuming the factual allegations are true, the plaintiff has stated a ground for relief that is plausible. That is, in Twombly’s words, a plaintiff must “allege facts” that, taken as true, are “suggestive of illegal conduct.” 550 U. S., at 564, n. 8. In Twombly, we were faced with allegations of a conspiracy to violate §1 of the Sherman Act through parallel conduct. The difficulty was that the conduct alleged was “consistent with conspiracy, but just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.” Id., at 554. We held that in that sort of circumstance, “[a]n allegation of parallel conduct is ...

Plaintiffs Matthew and Miriam Thomas (the “Thomases”) pro se appeal the district court’s dismissal of their claims against U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) and law firm Rubin Lublin, LLC (the “Rubin law firm”) for breach of contract, -wrongful attempted foreclosure, and violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”). After review, we affirm.
I. BACKGROUND
Because this appeal concerns the dismissal of the Thomases’ claims, we recount the factual allegations from the operative amended complaint. See Glover v. Liggett Grp., Inc., 459 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir. 2006) (noting that on review of a motion to dismiss, the factual allegations are accepted as true). We also discuss the procedural history.
A. Factual Allegations
In October 2006, the Thomases purchased residential „ property in Fulton County, Georgia by obtaining a mortgage loan from Freedom Mortgage Corporation (“Freedom”), The loan was secured by a security deed, which named Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (“MERS”) as the grantee of record, acting as nominee for the lender Freedom. In June 2011, the grantee MERS assigned the security deed to defendant “U.S. Bank, National Association, as Trustee for the holders of the specialty underwriting and residential finance trust, mortgage loan asset-backed certificates, series 2007-BCI.”
The Thomases’ amended complaint acknowledges that prior to the June 2011 assignment to U.S. Bank they had “trouble meeting their payments on the loan and defaulted.” So when U.S. Bank acquired the security deed, the Thomases had already defaulted. After default, the Thomases sought “an affordable loan modification” from U.S. Bank but were unsuccessful. The Thomases do not allege that they made payments to cure the default or otherwise attempted to bring the loan current.
On December 3, 2013, Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (“Nationstar”), acting on behalf of U.S. Bank, sent a letter addressed to the Thomases at 1240 Regency Center Drive SW, Atlanta, GA 30331-2081, which is the property at issue. The letter stated that “Nationstar is the mortgage loan ser-vicer for ‘U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, in trust for registered holders of Specialty Underwriting and Residential Finance Trust, Mortgage Loan Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2007-BCI.’” The letter stated that the Thomases had not made payments on their loan since June 1, 2009, and that the Thomases now owed past due mortgage payments, interest, and fees in the amount of $217,075.54 due from June 1, 2009, to December 3, 2013. The acceleration letter advised that the Thomases were required to pay that $217,075.54 by January 7, 2014, to cure their default. The acceleration letter advised that failure to pay $217,075.54 and cure the default “may result in acceleration of the sums secured by the Security Instrument, foreclosure proceedings and sale of the property.” A copy of this acceleration letter was attached to U.S. Bank’s motion to dismiss.
In their response to the motions to dismiss, the Thomases stated that they “ehal-lenge[d] the authenticity” of the December 3, 2013 acceleration letter because it was “completely unsworn and unauthenticated by affidavit, deposition or otherwise.” The Thomases denied that the acceleration letter was provided to them and argued that they were entitled to discovery to determine the authenticity of that letter.
The magistrate judge determined that “because the Plaintiffs challenge the authenticity of the purported Acceleration Notice, the Court may not consider that document as part of the pleadings for the purpose of resolving the Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss.” See Day v. Taylor, 400 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir. 2005).
But there is another notice letter to the Thomases that is attached to their own amended complaint that they do not dispute. In January 2014, the defendant Rubin law firm sent two letters to the Thomases on behalf of U.S. Bank as Trustee. The letters notified the Thomases that the Rubin law firm was representing U.S. Bank, that U.S. Bank and the Rubin law firm were instituting foreclosure proceedings against the Thomases’ residential property, and that the entire amount of the mortgage debt—$590,684.36—was due immediately. The January 14, 2014 letter stated as follows:
The entire amount of the debt secured by [the] Note and Security Deed has now been declared due and payable because, among other possible defaults, failure to pay the indebtedness as and when due and in the manner specified in the Note and Security Deed. The total amount of the debt owed may consist of unpaid principal balance, any unpaid accrued interest, escrow/impound shortages or credits, late charges, legal fees/ costs, and other charges. To find out the amount needed to either bring your Loan current or to pay off your Loan in full, please call [the listed telephone number].
U.S. Bank reported the “foi-eclosure default” to credit reporting agencies Equifax, Trans Union, and Experian, which negatively affected the Thomases’ credit score. U.S. Bank also advertised the Thomases’ home “for foreclosure,” which caused the Thomases to experience embarrassment, mental anguish, and emotional distress. The Thomases did not allege that the property was ever sold at a foreclosure sale or otherwise. But the Thomases did allege that the two January 2014 letters that the Rubin law firm sent did not comply with the acceleration notice requirements under the security deed.
On February 18, 2014, the Thomases sent a “R.E.S.P.A. Qualified Written Request” letter to U.S. Bank. The letter requested, inter alia, that U.S. Bank provide the Thomases with the following information: (1) “[a] complete audit history from alleged loan origination, showing the dates payments were applied, and to what internal accounts ... payments were applied,” (2) “[a] complete and itemized statement of all advances or charges against- this account,” and (3) “[a] complete and itemized statement of the escrow for this account, if any, from the date of the note origination to the date of [U.S. Bank’s] response to [the Thomases’ February 2014] letter.”
Seven days later, the Thomases filed their lawsuit against U.S. Bank and the Rubin law firm. The Thomases allege that U.S. Bank never responded to their February 18, 2014 letter.
B. Procedural History
On February 25, 2014, the Thomases filed their initial complaint against U.S. Bank and the Rubin law firm. The defendants responded with a motion to dismiss, but the district court granted the Thom-ases’ motion for leave to amend the complaint and denied the motion to dismiss as moot. The Thomases then filed an amended complaint, which included, inter alia, these exhibits: the note, the security deed, the June 2011 assignment of the security deed from MERS to U.S. Bank, the Rubin law firm’s two January 2014 letters, and the Thomases’ February 18, 2014 letter.
Defendants U.S. Bank and the Rubin law firm then filed separate motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. After full briefing, the magistrate judge recommended, in a Report, that both motions should be granted as to all claims in the amended complaint. The district court overruled the Thomases’ objections, adopted the Report, and dismissed the amended complaint. The district court also denied the Thomases’ motion for reconsideration. This appeal followed.
II. DISCUSSION
On appeal, the Thomases challenge the dismissal of their breach of contract, wrongful attempted foreclosure, FDCPA, and RESPA claims. We address each claim below.
A. Breach of Contract
As to their breach of contract claim, the Thomases- alleged that U.S. Bank breached the terms of the security deed by failing to provide adequate notice before accelerating the debt and threatening foreclosure. The Thomases contend that they suffered damages in these two ways: (1) U.S. Bank’s reporting of the Thomases’ “foreclosure default” to credit agencies lowered their credit score, and (2) U.S. Bank’s'advertisement of their home “for foreclosure” caused them to experience embarrassment, mental anguish, and emotional distress.
Under Georgia law, the elements of a claim for breach of contract are “the (1) breach and the (2) resultant damages (3) to the party who has the right to complain about the contract being broken.” Bates v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA, 768 F.3d 1126, 1130 (11th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Norton v. Budget Rent A Car Sys., Inc., 307 Ga.App. 501, 705 S.E.2d 305, 306 (2010)). In the context of breach of contract claims arising from premature or improper exercise of the power to accelerate indebtedness and sell property under the terms of a security deed, the plaintiff must show that damages would not have occurred but for the alleged breach. Id. at 1132-33.
&re, the Thomases’ amended complaint admitted that they defaulted on their mortgage payments and never cured the default. Indeed, even according to the amended complaint, the default occurred “sometime prior to the assignment” of the security deed to U.S. Bank in 2011, which was years before U.S. Bank sought to accelerate. Knowing they had defaulted, the Thomases admitted that they even sought a loan modification from U.S. Bank. But the Thomases never brought the loan current or otherwise cured the default in the years that followed.
Whether the past due debt of $217,075.54 was properly accelerated to $590,684.36 does not change the fact that the Thomases defaulted on their mortgage and did not cure that default. Any negative credit reporting or emotional injury would have resulted from this default and failure to cure regardless of whether U.S. Bank sent an acceleration notice that complied with the terms of the security deed. The factual allegations do not allow the reasonable inference that the alleged damages would not have occurred but for U.S. Bank’s failure to give proper acceleration notice. See id. at 1130, 1133; Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).
B. Wrongful Attempted Foreclosure
The amended complaint did not include a count for wrongful attempted foreclosure, but the Thomases attempted to assert such a claim in their response to U.S. Bank’s and the Rubin law firm’s motions to dismiss. The Thomases’ response to the motions to dismiss argued that U.S. Bank did not have an enforceable security interest in the property and thus was “without authority to foreclose property.” The Thomases did attach to their amended complaint a July 2013 assignment instrument between Bank of America, N.A. and Nationstar, which purports to assign the security deed to Nationstar. U.S. Bank contends that, because U.S. Bank was the holder of the security deed in July 2013, Bank of America, N.A. had no interest in the security deed and that this assignment is a nullity. We need not decide this issue on appeal for several reasons.
First, we affirm the dismissal of this wrongful attempted foreclosure claim because it was not in the amended complaint and was only raised in the Thomases’ response to the defendants’ motions to dismiss.
Second, although the Thomases admit that U.S, Bank was a holder of the security deed, the Thomases do not allege how Bank of America, N.A. obtained any ownership of the security deed to assign it to Nationstar. There is also no allegation in the amended complaint, or documentary evidence for that matter, that U.S. Bank assigned the security deed to Bank of America, N.A.
Third, as an independent and alternative reason, because the property was never foreclosed, the Thomases do not assert a claim for “wrongful foreclosure,” but only for “wrongful attempted foreclosure.” To prevail on a claim for wrongful attempted foreclosure under Georgia law, the plaintiff must prove “a knowing and intentional publication of untrue and derogatory information concerning the debt- or’s financial condition, and that damages were sustained as a direct result of this publication.” Bates, 768 F.3d at 1134 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Aetna Fin. Co. v. Culpepper, 171 Ga.App. 315, 320 S.E.2d 228, 232 (1984)). The amended complaint includes no allegations indicating that U.S. Bank or the Rubin law firm published any false or derogatory information concerning the Thomases’ financial condition. Accordingly, the Thomases failed to state a plausible claim for wrongful attempted foreclosure.
C. FDCPA
As to their FDCPA clajm, the Thomases alleged, in conclusory fashion, that defendants U.S. Bank and the Rubin law firm are “debt collectors” within the meaning of the FDCPA. The Thomases further alleged that the defendants did not comply with the pre-acceleration notice requirements of the security deed before sending letters threatening foreclosure and therefore the defendants threatened to take action they could not legally take in violation of §§ 1692e and 1692f of the FDCPA.
The FDCPA bars “debt collectors” from engaging in certain abusive practices in connection with the collection of debt. See 15 U.S.C. § 1692. For example, § 1692e provides' that a “debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.” Id. § 1692e. Section 1692f provides that a “debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.” Id. § 1692f. By the terms of its substantive provisions, the FDCPA only applies to the actions of a “debt collector.” Id. §§ 1692e, 1692f; see Davidson v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., 797 F.3d 1309, 1313 (11th Cir. 2015) (“There is no dispute that § 1692e applies only to debt collectors.”).
This district court did not err' in concluding that the factual allegations in the amended complaint were insufficient to show that the defendants were “debt collectors.” The term “debt collector” is defined in the FDCPA as (1) “any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts” or (2) any person “who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.” 15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6).
Here, aside from the bare legal conclusion that U.S. Bank and the Rubin law firm qualify as “debt collectors” under the FDCPA, the Thomases’ amended complaint makes no allegations suggesting that these defendants fall within the statutory definition of that term. The amended complaint includes no allegations indicating that (1) either U.S. Bank’s or the Rubin law firm’s principal business is the collection of debts or (2) either U.S. Bank or the Rubin law firm regularly collects or attempts to collect debts owed to another. See 15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6). Although U.S. Bank acquired the Thomases’ debt after the Thomases defaulted, this Court has concluded that the fact that a person acquired a debt after the borrower defaulted on that debt is not sufficient to indicate that the person who acquired the debt qualifies as a “debt collector” under the FDCPA. Davidson, 797 F.3d at 1313-16. A person acquiring a debt after default is only a “debt collector” where that person otherwise meets the statutory definition. Id. at 1316. Therefore, the Thomases’ FDCPAclaim fails.
D. RESPA
With respect to their RESPA claim against U.S. Bank, the Thomases summarily alleged that some of their loan payments were not properly credited to their loan account, that they sent a letter to U.S. Bank on February 18, 2014, requesting information regarding their loan account, and that U.S. Bank never responded to that letter. The Thomases contend that their February 18, 2014 letter to U.S. Bank constituted a “Qualified Written Request” (“QWR”) under RESPA, that U.S. Bank’s failure to timely respond to that letter was in -violation of RESPA, and that they are entitled to damages resulting from that violation.
RESPA imposes certain duties on loan “servicers” for the purpose of protecting consumers. Pertinent here are RESPA’s procedures for providing additional loan information to a borrower upon the borrower’s request. See 12 U.S.C. § 2605. A borrower seeking information about a loan can contact the loan servicer by sending a QWR, which is a written correspondence that (1) “includes, or otherwise enables the servicer to identify, the name and account of the borrower” and (2) “includes a statement of the reasons for the belief of the borrower, to the extent applicable, that the account is in error or provides sufficient detail to the servicer regarding other information sought by the borrower.” Id. § 2605(e)(1)(B).
When a loan servicer receives a QWR from a borrower, the loan servicer must first provide to the borrower, within five days, a written response acknowledging receipt of the QWR. Id. § 2605(e)(1)(A). The loan servicer must then, within thirty days of receiving the QWR, send the borrower a written response explaining any corrections to the borrower’s loan account, clarifying the reasons that the loan servi-cer believes the borrower’s account is accurate, or providing the information the borrower requested. Id. § 2605(e)(2). A borrower who shows that a loan servicer failed to carry out its duties under this provision may be entitled to actual and/or statutory damages. Id. § 2605(f). This Court has held that “damages are an essential element in pleading a RESPA claim.” Renfroe v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, 822 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir. 2016). The Thomases’ RESPA claim fails for two reasons.
First, the amended complaint is devoid of factual allegations indicating that U.S. Bank qualifies as a “servicer” of the Thom-ases’ mortgage within the meaning of § 2605. See 12 U.S.C. § 2605(i) (defining “servicer” as “the person responsible for servicing of a loan” and “servicing” as “receiving any scheduled periodic payments from a borrower pursuant to the terms of any loan ... and maiding the payments of principal and interest and such other payments with respect to the amounts received from the borrower”). The allegations in the amended complaint say nothing about whether U.S. Bank is responsible for receiving and otherwise handling payments on the Thomases’ mortgage loan.
Second, even assuming arguendo that U.S. Bank can be considered a “loan servicer,” the Thomases did not allege any facts indicating that U.S. Bank’s failure to respond to the February 18, 2014 letter caused them any cognizable damages. As noted in relation to the Thomases’ breach of contract claim, any injury the Thomases suffered is attributable to their 2011 default and failure to cure, which occurred years before the Thomases sent this purported QWR letter in 2014. The Thomases were aware of this 2011 default and did not bring the loan current or otherwise cure the default in the years that followed. The amended complaint is insufficient to show that the Thomases are entitled to actual or statutory damages under RESPA. See 12 U.S.C. § 2605(f) (providing that borrowers may recover actual damages incurred as a result of the RESPA violation and statutory damages “in the case of a pattern or practice of noncompliance with the requirements” of the statute).
III. CONCLUSION
For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal of the Thomases’ claims against U.S. Bank and the Rubin law firm for breach of contract, wrongful attempted foreclosure, and violations of the FDCPA and RESPA.
AFFIRMED.
. The Thomases have proceeded pro se both in the district court and on appeal. We recognize that pro se pleadings are to be liberally construed. Tannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998).
. The Thomases also asserted claims for negligence, declaratory relief, and violations of the Truth in Lending Act, but the Thomases do not challenge the dismissal of those claims.

In the context of patent infringement, the concept of obviousness is crucial in determining the
validity of a patent. The court needs to consider whether a person of ordinary skill in the field
would have arrived at the claimed invention without resorting to inventive ingenuity. In the case of
Anderson's patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the
requirements of patentability.  In the reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court held that the patent
in question did not meet the requirements of patentability because it was obvious to a person of
ordinary skill in the field. Similarly, in the reference case 106 F.2d 554, the court found that the
claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.  In the case of
Anderson's patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious because it was a
combination of old elements that were well-known in the field. The court noted that the prior art
references, such as the Thompson and Lampe patents, showed that the simultaneous deposition of
fiberglass with resin binder was already known. The court also noted that the use of a chopper
between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid was also known in the prior art.
Furthermore, the court found that the claimed invention did not have any unusual or surprising
consequences from the unification of the elements. The court noted that the materials used in the
prior art references did not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced
plastics, but the court still found that the prior art references were relevant to the issue of
obviousness.  In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Anderson's patents was influenced
by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did
not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The court's finding of obviousness was
based on the combination of old elements that were well-known in the field, and the court did not
find any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements.

Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No.
2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s
findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said
above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies
in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its
efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise. The method and
apparatus claimed by claim 11 of Anderson ’314 “would have been obvious at the time the invention
was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * * ” (35 U.S.C.A. § 103) upon perceiving that
the strand roving fell to the ground when the operator stopped the machine. “[I]t is not invention
to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary
progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result.” Application of Demarche, 219 F.2d 952,
955, 42 CCPA 793 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 1955). Again, our conclusions in this regard
are influenced by the fact that so little time elapsed between the introduction of roving in strands
and the application for Anderson’s main patent. Compare Forestek Plating & Mfg. Co. v. Knapp-Monarch
Co., 106 F.2d 554, 557 (6 Cir. 1939) (validity of improvement patent upheld in light of prior,
repeated unsuccessful efforts).

winding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant’s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof. The Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel. When the thread breaks (or when the tension thereof decreases), the arm drops

previous_text: TUTTLE, Chief Judge. This appeal is from judgment for plaintiff-appellee in a patent infringement
suit, Ibis Enterprises, Ltd. v. Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state
the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court’s findings of fact as follows:
1. Parties Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand
Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland,
Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business
at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida,
Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand
Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in
suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a
subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company. 2. Civil Action This is a civil action for infringement of
United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United
States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair
competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and
apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates
to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April
4, 1961. 3. Background of Patentee David F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man
of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he
served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test
work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from
the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12,
51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the “Vidal” process for forming glass reinforced
plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use
for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: “hand lay-up”
and “matched die (or metal) mold” (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166). 4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up
Method The “Vidal” process involved, in part, the “hand lay-up” process of laboriously hand
tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of
a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was
necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified
within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the
“Vidal” process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then
applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic
was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165;
Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215). 5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method (a) Another process then in use
for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called “matched metal mold” or “matched
die” process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform,
which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or
resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of
the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally,
the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the
resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176). (b) The
fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-
like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column
1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the
matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or
during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or
liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform.
(Tr. pp. 112-114). 6. Anderson Early Work and Invention (a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand
lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by
pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor
and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was
further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and
the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the
“matched metal mold” process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * * 7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125 (a) The
apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages
from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125; “the depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding
cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12
into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from
the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray
guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter
10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor
may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic
impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article
being fabricated.” (Column 2, lines 39-52). The form of cutter described in the patent comprises a
pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the
rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between
them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced
relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines
39-72, column 3, lines 1-19). (b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125
are described by the following passages from its specifications: “The present invention includes the
method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber
into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber,
impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on
to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a
minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its
setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.” (Column 1,
lines 55-65). 'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst,
there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of
the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in
separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed ■only upon the meeting
and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim ■6).
* * ■* 11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit (a) During 1958, Defendant David H.
Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif
Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson
process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35). (b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H.
Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation
(Plaintiff’s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as
such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the
patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently
terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months
thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this
material contained the legend “Patented Process” while making, using and selling admittedly
infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp.
44-57; Plaintiffs’ Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76).
* * * Yj * * * (a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The
Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described
in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers
positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through
a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of
this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of
injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to
prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr.
pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48). (b) In the Defendant’s device, there is a
single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter
rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the
cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical
purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161). 18. Defendants Palm Off Their
Apparatus as Plaintiffs’ Each of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for
sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff
Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa
Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40). At this
point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a
legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the “clearly erroneous” limitation. Second,
without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court
[to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of “primary,” as opposed to “ultimate” fact,
see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are
insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not
eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in
the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff,
Federal Practice and Procedure § 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961). Third, we are cognizant of the
fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid.
Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29,
1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of
noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this
defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,
rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186
F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit
sustained the California District Court’s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in
light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly
erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court’s opinion dealing with the ground on
which we base our decision. Fourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between
newness, 35 U.S.C.A. § 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 as statutory conditions
of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context
of combination patents. Directing our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent
(hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the
“rather severe test” promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of
old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71
S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there “any unusual or surprising consequences from
the unification of the elements here concerned?” Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means,
but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to
a mandate from the Supreme Court to “scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned
to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.” Ibid. In
light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson’s
claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson
did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance
should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may
be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area. As the
district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony,
self-serving statements and credibility problems in general — problems which, of course, must be
properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the “clearly erroneous” limitation. The evidence
upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record. It is clear from the
trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a
coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116
(Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex
(British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns
used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have
invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one
substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson’s purposes:
Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the
Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It
is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already
been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson’s efforts in this area (Anderson
deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951). Pursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior
art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and
spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the
record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463
(Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with
suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it
with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos.
2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex).
Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is
Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into
short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured
plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson
patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson’s affidavit under Patent Office
Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of “obviousiness” and “newness” of.the
Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the
previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No.
2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes — both relating to
the making of pre-form — combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator
element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a
pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in
finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-
form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96). The final
component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed
to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se
in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the
cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were
apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at
113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson’s activity in the field by
several years (Anderson deposition at 143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation
of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that
they were the same in principle as his cutter, “in that the roving was cut by a blade which was
protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.”
(Anderson deposition at 117). A discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without
reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in
the district court’s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the
record supports the district court’s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had “abandoned” its efforts
in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility’s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of
Anderson’s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson.
The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical
conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former. Although certainly not exhaustive,
the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson’s
efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve
upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the
first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination
of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in
more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating.
Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a
resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate. The California district court
correctly described the substance of Anderson’s case for improvement over the prior art as being
“limited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step,
depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.” Canadian
Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).
Having thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson’s improvements
thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention —
subjecting Anderson ’125 to the “rather severe test” outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great
Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so
heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson ’125 that it
failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of
“obviousness” of the Anderson combination. While it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the
chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his
apparatus “occurred to me the moment I saw the roving.” (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the
availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or ’51, (Anderson deposition at
69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials
and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon,
supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he
had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement,
already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of
resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of
fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold
and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58,
63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and
the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson ’125 (Anderson
deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra,
which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not
flexible enough for Anderson’s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device,
supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly
was not a suitable cutter for Anderson’s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades
could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in
this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122). From this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude
that the Anderson ’125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in “any unusual or surprising
consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co.,
supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end
purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field
of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the
relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. § 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an
imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be
considered in determining “obviousness” under 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 accordingly, would not correspond to
reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in
1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a
stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of
simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the
Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve — the advancement of
science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas,
concurring) . To summarize, the Anderson ’125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously
depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the
prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements “perform any additional or
different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been
added together, and still they make only four.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at
152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand
Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that “patentable
invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a
spray gun — a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to
accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the
spray gun separately.” Our conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass
industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for
experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson,
following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of
the Anderson ’125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art
to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to
the existing art. Implicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to
the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary,
evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.

In considering the objections to the magistrate's report, it is crucial to reference the Federal Magistrate’s Act, 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), which has been extensively interpreted in several cases. As highlighted in 616 F.2d 603 and 678 F.2d 376, any party may serve and file written objections to the magistrate's proposed findings and recommendations within ten days, allowing a judge to make a de novo determination of contested portions.

In the case at hand, the magistrate directed that objections should be filed within ten days, paralleling the procedure noted in 474 U.S. 140, where failure to file timely objections can result in waiver of the right to appeal. Despite the potential for review sua sponte by the district judge, as occurred in 474 U.S. 140, such a provision underscores the importance of adhering to procedural rules.

Therefore, in alignment with judicial precedents (616 F.2d 603, 678 F.2d 376, 474 U.S. 140), this court adopts the magistrate’s report and recommendations. Consequently, the claims in Count I are adequately detailed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), and further discovery will entail a comprehensive review post-pretrial, ensuring due process and judicial economy.

Report and recommendation of the magistrate is adopted.

Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court.

A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. (Emphasis suppl.) Basically, the dispute between the parties centers upon the effect of the phrase “may serve and file written objections.” Defendants assert that a party may decide not to file, but that filing is obligatory if he is dissatisfied. Plaintiffs’ position is that the district court has a duty to review the magistrate’s recommendations in any event, and that the losing party need file objections only if he wishes a hearing. Although the court cited its Local Rule 7(c), this rule is of no assistance. Other than referring to the statute itself, it is limited to “appeal[s]” from orders under subsection (b)(1)(A). We turn, accordingly, to the statute. There are three possible areas of consideration: the statutory language, the statutory purpose, and the legislative history. First, plaintiffs point to the

The last page of the Magistrate’s report contained the prominent legend: “ANY OBJECTIONS to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of Courts within ten (10) days of receipt of this notice. Failure to file objections within the specified time waives the right to appeal the District Court’s order. See: United States v.

She sought and received an extension of time to file objections through June 15, 1982, on the grounds that “this case entails many substantive issues and counsel needs more time to write his brief.” However, petitioner made no further submissions on the merits to the District Court. Notwithstanding petitioner’s failure to file objections, the District Judge sua sponte “review[ed] . . . the entire record de novo,” App. 59, and dismissed the petition on the merits.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT (# 29)
Feb. 27, 1989.
ROBERT B. COLLINGS, United States Magistrate.
Terry Howard, Byron Roseman and Frederick Wikander are three Massachusetts physicians who were trustees of Medical Associates, a Massachusetts business trust. Chelmsford Medical Associates, Inc., a professional corporation, is alleged to be the successor-in-interest of Medical Associates.
The instant case arises out of agreements reached whereby the defendant would sell and grant certain licenses respecting a computer system for use by the business trust. The Second Amended Complaint contains claims for intentional or negligent misrepresentation (Count I), breach of contract (Count II), breach of warranties (Count III), negligence/computer malpractice (Count IV) and unfair or deceptive acts and practices (Count V). Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.
I RECOMMEND that all but one of the grounds listed in the Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss The Amended Complaint (# 29) be DEFERRED for resolution at the PreTrial Conference when discovery has been completed. See Rule 12(d), Fed.R.Civ.P. The reason for this recommendation is that the defendant does not assert that all of the claims in the Second Amended Complaint (as opposed to the Amended Complaint) are subject to dismissal. Specifical ly, to the extent that Count II of the Second Amended Complaint contains a claim by plaintiffs Howard, Roseman and Wikander for breach of contract, defendant does not contend that Count II is subject to dismissal. Since the case will go forward on that claim regardless of whether the other claims are dismissed and since the scope of discovery would be approximately the same regardless of whether or not the other claims are dismissed at this time, it seems to me in the interests of judicial economy to defer the motion to dismiss the other claims until after the issues respecting those claims have been sharpened by the discovery process.
The one exception is the claim that the counts sounding in fraud and misrepresentation are not pleaded with the particularity required by Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. This type of issue should not be deferred.
This is not the first time I have reviewed plaintiffs’ pleadings to determine if the allegations of fraud have complied with Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. On February 12, 1988,1 issued a Memorandum (# 20) indicating that although the content of the misrepresentations was adequately pleaded, the pleadings were defective because of the failure to state the time and place of the alleged misrepresentations.
In the Amended Complaint (# 26) and in the Second Amended Complaint (# 62), plaintiffs have sought to rectify this deficiency. They claim they have done so; defendant disagrees.
Count I of the Second Amended Complaint alleging misrepresentation is divided into two parts. The first deals with misrepresentations allegedly made before the parties entered into a written contract; the second deals with misrepresentations made after the written contract was signed.
Paragraph 34 concerns misrepresentations made before the contract was signed and reads as follows:
34. To induce Chelmsford Medical Associates to enter into the Systems Purchase Agreement, Cycare falsely represented the features, performance and quality of the system and the nature and quality of Cycare’s support services, and falsely represented the benefits to Chelmsford Medical Associates of using the system. Specifically, and without limitation, Cycare made the representations as described in paragraph 11, above.
Paragraph 11 contains twelve subparts (a through 1) which list “representations” allegedly made. After each of the subparts, a “specification” of time and place is set forth in parentheses. The “specifications” are similar. Examples are:
a. (This representation was made during the one-site demonstration and in documentation.)”
c. “... (This representation was made in the on-site and off-site demonstrations, during the on-site visits and during telephone discussions between the parties.)”
g. “... (These representations were made during the on-site and off-site demonstrations, during the on-site visits and in the Written Proposal and in the documentation.)”
Paragraph 8 contains dates and places of a number of these events. The on-site demonstration occurred at the plaintiffs’ offices on May 23-24, 1985. The “Written Proposal” was made on or about June 24, 1985. The “off-site” demonstration occurred on June 26-27, 1985 at Memphis, Tennessee. It is further alleged that “additional on-site visits by Cycare to Chelmsford [occurred] during the period July-September, 1985.” Lastly, it is alleged that the telephone conversations occurred between May, 1985 and the date of the execution of the written contract, i.e., September 30, 1985.
The second group of alleged misrepresentations is alleged to have occurred after September 30,1985. Paragraphs 35 and 36 of the Second Amended Complaint read as follows:
35. To induce Chelmsford Medical Associates to continue to use a defective system, CyCare falsely represented that it could and would remedy the malfunctions and problems with the computer system. These representations were made beginning in approximately March, 1986 when the first computer run was made on the CyCare system, and continued to be made up to and including June, 1987. These representations were made by CyCare while present at Chelmsford Medical Associates’ site, including but not limited to meetings in March 1986, April 1986, July 1986, October 1986 and March 1987 and in telephone conversations throughout the period, including but not limited to the following correspondence:
a. letter dated August 6, 1986 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
b. letter dated August 21, 1986 from David Bennett to Alan Carr-Locke;
c. letter dated September 24, 1986 from David Bennett to Alan Carr-Locke;
d. letter dated October 13, 1986 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
e. letter dated October 25, 1986 from Lorraine Hess to Alan Carr-Locke;
f. letter dated March 30, 1987 from Lorraine Hess to Dick Farrar;
g. letter dated April 6, 1987 from Daniel A. Wolfe to Diane Richards;
h. letter dated April 22, 1987 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
i. letter dated May 22, 1987 from Daniel A. Wolfe to Byron Roseman, M.D.
The resolution of whether plaintiffs have now complied with Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ. P., is governed by the five most recent First Circuit cases construing Rule 9(b), Fed.R. Civ.P., i.e. McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., 633 F.2d 226, 228 (1 Cir.,1980); Wayne v. Gulf Oil Corp., 739 F.2d 11 (1 Cir.,1984); Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., 754 F.2d 430 (1 Cir.,1985); Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441 (1 Cir.,1985) and New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, 829 F.2d 286 (1 Cir.,1987).
In McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., the Court wrote:
The clear weight of authority is that Rule 9 requires specification of time, place and content of an alleged false representation but not the circumstances or evidence from which fraudulent intent could be inferred, [citations omitted] This interpretation of Rule 9 comports with its language, harmonizes the rule with Rule 8, which requires that averments in pleadings be concise and direct, and at the same time fulfills a major purpose of Rule 9: to give adequate notice of the plaintiff’s claim of fraud or mistake, [citations omitted]
Id., 633 F.2d at 228-29.
In Wayne v. Gulf Oil Corp., the Court added “... that allegations based on ‘information and belief' do not satisfy the particularity requirement unless the complaint sets forth the facts on which the belief is founded ... and that the requirement that supporting facts be pleaded applies even when the fraud relates to matters within the knowledge of the opposing party.” Id., 739 F.2d at 13-14.
In Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., the Court noted that the “purpose of the rule [9(b) ] is to protect the defendant from unfair surprise and to discourage ‘strike suits.’ ” Id., 754 F.2d at 439. In addition, the Court wrote:
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(f) provides that “all pleadings shall be construed so as to do substantial justice.” Considered as a whole, we find that the facts and circumstances pleaded in the complaint were sufficient to give notice to [the defendant] of the nature of the claims against it and find no error in the district court’s consideration of fraud, [citation omitted]
Id. at 440.
In Hayduk v. Lanna, the Court wrote:
One of the main purposes of [Rule 9(b) ] is to apprise the defendant of fraudulent claims and of the acts which form the basis of the claim, [citations omitted] In other words, ‘[i]n cases in which fraud lies at the core of the action, the rule does not permit a complainant to file suit first, and subsequently to search for a cause of action.’ Lopez v. Bulova Watch Co., Inc., 582 F.Supp. 755, 766 (D.R.I.1984) (citing Deyhle v. Barclay Investments, Inc., No. 82-0662, slip op. at 4 (D.R.I. Oct. 13, 1983)) (emphasis added).
Id., 775 F.2d at 443.
Lastly, in New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, the Court considered the applicability of Rule 9(b) to predicate acts of mail and wire fraud which were pleaded in a RICO claim. The Court held that “Rule 9(b) requires specificity in the pleading of RICO mail and wire fraud [and] [t]his degree of specificity is no more nor less than we have required in fraud and securities fraud cases.” Id., 829 F.2d at 290 (citations omitted). In so holding, the Court wrote that:
Generally, there are three purposes behind Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirement: (1) to place the defendants on notice and enable them to prepare meaningful responses; (2) to preclude the use of a groundless fraud claim as a pretext to discovering a wrong or as a “strike suit”; and (3) to safeguard defendants from frivolous charges which might damage their reputations, [citations omitted]
Id., 829 F.2d at 289.
The Court specifically noted that in determining whether Rule 9(b) is satisfied, a Court must “keep in mind” these three major purposes of Rule 9(b).
Applying these principles to the case at bar, it becomes apparent that the Second Amended Complaint complies with the provisions of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. Therefore, I RECOMMEND that Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss The Amended Complaint (# 29) be deemed to seek dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint and that to the extent that the motion seeks dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint on the ground that it fails to plead fraud and misrepresentation with the requisite degree of particularity, the motion be DENIED.
First, all but two of the misrepresentations alleged in paragraph 11 (made before the written contract was executed) are alleged to have been made at either the “on-site demonstration” or the “off-site demonstration” or both. The dates and places of both the “on-site demonstration” and the “off-site demonstration” are stated with particularity in paragraph 8. The other two misrepresentations are alleged to have been made at “on-site visits.” Since “on-site” refers to the plaintiffs’ business premises, the place of the misrepresentations is pleaded with particularity. The time is specified in paragraph 8 as being within the three months period from July through September, 1985. In the circumstances, I view this as sufficient particularity.
Second, each of the alleged misrepresentations made after the written contract was signed are alleged to have been made in nine pieces of correspondence which are listed by date, sender, and recipient in paragraph 35 of the Second Amended Complaint. This is sufficient particularity as to time and place for the purposes of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.
Third, I view the allegations respecting misrepresentations made both before and after the written contract was executed as being sufficient when considering the purposes of Rule 9(b). The allegations give sufficient notice of the basis of the allegations of fraud to enable the defendant to prepare a meaningful response. In view of the sufficiency of the breach of contract claim which arises out of the same set of circumstances, it can hardly be said that the fraud claim is a pretext to discovering a wrong or that the fraud claim is being used as a “strike suit.” Roberts v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co., Inc., 653 F.Supp. 406, 415-16 (D.Mass., 1986). Lastly, the fraud claim cannot be labelled as frivolous.
Fourth, in view of what I have indicated regarding the sufficiency as to time and place of misrepresentations made at on-site and off-site demonstrations and at on-site visits and in correspondence, I do not find a violation of Rule 9(b) in the allegations that the same misrepresentations were also made in unspecified telephone calls between agents of the parties during the specified time periods. Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., is to be harmonized with Rule 8(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., which provides for a “short and plain statement of the claim.” There would be no harmony between the two rules if a plaintiff, in order to comply with Rule 9(b), had to list every time and place at which a specific misrepresentation was repeated.
Lastly, I do not see a violation of Rule 9(b) in the failure of the plaintiff to identify the specific agent of the defendant who made each misrepresentation. Although other courts have construed Rule 9(b) as requiring an identification of the maker of the misrepresentation, none of the First Circuit cases indicate that such identification is a prerequisite to compliance with Rule 9(b); all that is required is a specification of time, place and content. To be sure, I can envisage some circumstances in which an identification might well be required. For example, if a complaint alleged only a single misrepresentation by an agent of a defendant and specified the time, place and content but not the identity of the agent, it could well be argued that the defendant-corporation would need further specification in order to make a meaningful response to the claim. But the circumstances of the instant case are different. There appears to have been an extended period of dealings between the parties culminating in a written contract which both sides acknowledge as having executed. I cannot see how a specification of the identity of the defendant’s agents who allegedly made the misrepresentations is necessary in order for the defendant to understand the basis of the fraud claim and to be able to respond to it.

I am happy to help you with your query. Based on the reference cases you provided, specifically 616 F.2d 603, 678 F.2d 376, and 474 U.S. 140, I can assist you in analyzing the legal issues related to the Federal Magistrates Act and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

In the reference case 616 F.2d 603, the court held that a party may choose not to file objections to a magistrate's report and recommendation, but if they do file objections, the objections must be served and filed within the specified time period. This is in line with the statutory language and purpose of the Federal Magistrates Act.

In the reference case 678 F.2d 376, the court emphasized the importance of specificity in pleading fraud and misrepresentation claims. The court held that allegations based on "information and belief" do not satisfy the particularity requirement unless the complaint sets forth the facts on which the belief is founded.

In the reference case 474 U.S. 140, the court reiterated the importance of specificity in pleading fraud and misrepresentation claims. The court held that Rule 9(b) requires specification of time, place, and content of an alleged false representation, and that allegations based on "information and belief" do not satisfy the particularity requirement.

Based on these reference cases, it is clear that the Federal Magistrates Act and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require specificity and particularity in pleading fraud and misrepresentation claims. The courts have emphasized the importance of providing adequate notice to defendants of the alleged fraudulent conduct and the need to specify the time, place, and content of the alleged misrepresentations.

In the context of the instant case, it appears that the Second Amended Complaint complies with the requirements of Rule 9(b) and the Federal Magistrates Act. The complaint provides sufficient specificity and particularity in pleading the alleged misrepresentations and provides adequate notice to the defendants of the alleged fraudulent conduct.

In conclusion, based on the reference cases and the analysis provided, it is clear that the Federal Magistrates Act and Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require specificity and particularity in pleading fraud and misrepresentation claims. The courts have emphasized the importance of providing adequate notice to defendants of the alleged fraudulent conduct and the need to specify the time, place, and content of the alleged misrepresent

for the disposition, by a judge . . .” The Act further provides, (C) [T]he magistrate shall file his proposed findings and recommendations under subparagraph (B) with the court and a copy shall forthwith be mailed to all parties. Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. (Emphasis suppl.) Basically, the dispute between the parties centers upon the effect of the phrase “may serve and file written objections.” Defendants assert that a party may decide not to file, but that filing is obligatory if he is dissatisfied. Plaintiffs’ position is that the district court has a duty to review the magistrate’s recommendations in any event, and that the losing party need file objections only if he wishes a hearing. Although the court cited its Local Rule 7(c), this rule is of no assistance. Other than referring to the statute itself, it is limited to “appeal[s]” from orders under subsection (b)(1)(A). We turn, accordingly, to the statute. There are three possible areas of consideration: the statutory language, the statutory purpose, and the legislative history. First, plaintiffs point to the

the Magistrate’s Report and Recommendation dated May 14, 1981.” Appellant’s brief does not discuss at all the question of appealability; it assumes that, because the court adopted the magistrate’s report and recommendation, it can challenge the motion to suppress. This was an incorrect assumption. The Federal Magistrate’s Act, 28 U.S.C. § 631 et seq. reads in pertinent part: parties. Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. The judge may also receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate with instructions. (B) a judge may also designate a magistrate to conduct hearings, including evi-dentiary hearings, and to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition, by a judge of the court, of any motion excepted in subparagraph (A), of applications for posttrial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses and of prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement.

admit the proffered testimony had not impaired the fundamental fairness of the trial, and therefore was not an adequate ground for habeas corpus relief. The last page of the Magistrate’s report contained the prominent legend: “ANY OBJECTIONS to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of Courts within ten (10) days of receipt of this notice. Failure to file objections within the specified time waives the right to appeal the District Court’s order. See: United States v. Walters, 638 F. 2d 947 (6th Cir. 1981).” Despite this clear notice, petitioner failed to file objections at any time. She sought and received an extension of time to file objections through June 15, 1982, on the grounds that “this case entails many substantive issues and counsel needs more time to write his brief.” However, petitioner made no further submissions on the merits to the District Court. Notwithstanding petitioner’s failure to file objections, the District Judge sua sponte “review[ed] . . . the entire record de novo,” App. 59, and dismissed the petition on the merits. Petitioner sought and was granted leave to appeal. Petitioner’s brief on appeal raised only the issue of the Battered Wife Syndrome testimony. The brief provided no explanation for petitioner’s failure to object to the Magistrate’s report. Counsel for petitioner waived oral argument, and the case was decided on the briefs.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT (# 29)
Feb. 27, 1989.
ROBERT B. COLLINGS, United States Magistrate.
Terry Howard, Byron Roseman and Frederick Wikander are three Massachusetts physicians who were trustees of Medical Associates, a Massachusetts business trust. Chelmsford Medical Associates, Inc., a professional corporation, is alleged to be the successor-in-interest of Medical Associates.
The instant case arises out of agreements reached whereby the defendant would sell and grant certain licenses respecting a computer system for use by the business trust. The Second Amended Complaint contains claims for intentional or negligent misrepresentation (Count I), breach of contract (Count II), breach of warranties (Count III), negligence/computer malpractice (Count IV) and unfair or deceptive acts and practices (Count V). Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.
I RECOMMEND that all but one of the grounds listed in the Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss The Amended Complaint (# 29) be DEFERRED for resolution at the PreTrial Conference when discovery has been completed. See Rule 12(d), Fed.R.Civ.P. The reason for this recommendation is that the defendant does not assert that all of the claims in the Second Amended Complaint (as opposed to the Amended Complaint) are subject to dismissal. Specifical ly, to the extent that Count II of the Second Amended Complaint contains a claim by plaintiffs Howard, Roseman and Wikander for breach of contract, defendant does not contend that Count II is subject to dismissal. Since the case will go forward on that claim regardless of whether the other claims are dismissed and since the scope of discovery would be approximately the same regardless of whether or not the other claims are dismissed at this time, it seems to me in the interests of judicial economy to defer the motion to dismiss the other claims until after the issues respecting those claims have been sharpened by the discovery process.
The one exception is the claim that the counts sounding in fraud and misrepresentation are not pleaded with the particularity required by Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. This type of issue should not be deferred.
This is not the first time I have reviewed plaintiffs’ pleadings to determine if the allegations of fraud have complied with Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. On February 12, 1988,1 issued a Memorandum (# 20) indicating that although the content of the misrepresentations was adequately pleaded, the pleadings were defective because of the failure to state the time and place of the alleged misrepresentations.
In the Amended Complaint (# 26) and in the Second Amended Complaint (# 62), plaintiffs have sought to rectify this deficiency. They claim they have done so; defendant disagrees.
Count I of the Second Amended Complaint alleging misrepresentation is divided into two parts. The first deals with misrepresentations allegedly made before the parties entered into a written contract; the second deals with misrepresentations made after the written contract was signed.
Paragraph 34 concerns misrepresentations made before the contract was signed and reads as follows:
34. To induce Chelmsford Medical Associates to enter into the Systems Purchase Agreement, Cycare falsely represented the features, performance and quality of the system and the nature and quality of Cycare’s support services, and falsely represented the benefits to Chelmsford Medical Associates of using the system. Specifically, and without limitation, Cycare made the representations as described in paragraph 11, above.
Paragraph 11 contains twelve subparts (a through 1) which list “representations” allegedly made. After each of the subparts, a “specification” of time and place is set forth in parentheses. The “specifications” are similar. Examples are:
a. (This representation was made during the one-site demonstration and in documentation.)”
c. “... (This representation was made in the on-site and off-site demonstrations, during the on-site visits and during telephone discussions between the parties.)”
g. “... (These representations were made during the on-site and off-site demonstrations, during the on-site visits and in the Written Proposal and in the documentation.)”
Paragraph 8 contains dates and places of a number of these events. The on-site demonstration occurred at the plaintiffs’ offices on May 23-24, 1985. The “Written Proposal” was made on or about June 24, 1985. The “off-site” demonstration occurred on June 26-27, 1985 at Memphis, Tennessee. It is further alleged that “additional on-site visits by Cycare to Chelmsford [occurred] during the period July-September, 1985.” Lastly, it is alleged that the telephone conversations occurred between May, 1985 and the date of the execution of the written contract, i.e., September 30, 1985.
The second group of alleged misrepresentations is alleged to have occurred after September 30,1985. Paragraphs 35 and 36 of the Second Amended Complaint read as follows:
35. To induce Chelmsford Medical Associates to continue to use a defective system, CyCare falsely represented that it could and would remedy the malfunctions and problems with the computer system. These representations were made beginning in approximately March, 1986 when the first computer run was made on the CyCare system, and continued to be made up to and including June, 1987. These representations were made by CyCare while present at Chelmsford Medical Associates’ site, including but not limited to meetings in March 1986, April 1986, July 1986, October 1986 and March 1987 and in telephone conversations throughout the period, including but not limited to the following correspondence:
a. letter dated August 6, 1986 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
b. letter dated August 21, 1986 from David Bennett to Alan Carr-Locke;
c. letter dated September 24, 1986 from David Bennett to Alan Carr-Locke;
d. letter dated October 13, 1986 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
e. letter dated October 25, 1986 from Lorraine Hess to Alan Carr-Locke;
f. letter dated March 30, 1987 from Lorraine Hess to Dick Farrar;
g. letter dated April 6, 1987 from Daniel A. Wolfe to Diane Richards;
h. letter dated April 22, 1987 from James R. Eley to Byron Roseman, M.D.;
i. letter dated May 22, 1987 from Daniel A. Wolfe to Byron Roseman, M.D.
The resolution of whether plaintiffs have now complied with Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ. P., is governed by the five most recent First Circuit cases construing Rule 9(b), Fed.R. Civ.P., i.e. McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., 633 F.2d 226, 228 (1 Cir.,1980); Wayne v. Gulf Oil Corp., 739 F.2d 11 (1 Cir.,1984); Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., 754 F.2d 430 (1 Cir.,1985); Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441 (1 Cir.,1985) and New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, 829 F.2d 286 (1 Cir.,1987).
In McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., the Court wrote:
The clear weight of authority is that Rule 9 requires specification of time, place and content of an alleged false representation but not the circumstances or evidence from which fraudulent intent could be inferred, [citations omitted] This interpretation of Rule 9 comports with its language, harmonizes the rule with Rule 8, which requires that averments in pleadings be concise and direct, and at the same time fulfills a major purpose of Rule 9: to give adequate notice of the plaintiff’s claim of fraud or mistake, [citations omitted]
Id., 633 F.2d at 228-29.
In Wayne v. Gulf Oil Corp., the Court added “... that allegations based on ‘information and belief' do not satisfy the particularity requirement unless the complaint sets forth the facts on which the belief is founded ... and that the requirement that supporting facts be pleaded applies even when the fraud relates to matters within the knowledge of the opposing party.” Id., 739 F.2d at 13-14.
In Simcox v. San Juan Shipyard, Inc., the Court noted that the “purpose of the rule [9(b) ] is to protect the defendant from unfair surprise and to discourage ‘strike suits.’ ” Id., 754 F.2d at 439. In addition, the Court wrote:
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(f) provides that “all pleadings shall be construed so as to do substantial justice.” Considered as a whole, we find that the facts and circumstances pleaded in the complaint were sufficient to give notice to [the defendant] of the nature of the claims against it and find no error in the district court’s consideration of fraud, [citation omitted]
Id. at 440.
In Hayduk v. Lanna, the Court wrote:
One of the main purposes of [Rule 9(b) ] is to apprise the defendant of fraudulent claims and of the acts which form the basis of the claim, [citations omitted] In other words, ‘[i]n cases in which fraud lies at the core of the action, the rule does not permit a complainant to file suit first, and subsequently to search for a cause of action.’ Lopez v. Bulova Watch Co., Inc., 582 F.Supp. 755, 766 (D.R.I.1984) (citing Deyhle v. Barclay Investments, Inc., No. 82-0662, slip op. at 4 (D.R.I. Oct. 13, 1983)) (emphasis added).
Id., 775 F.2d at 443.
Lastly, in New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, the Court considered the applicability of Rule 9(b) to predicate acts of mail and wire fraud which were pleaded in a RICO claim. The Court held that “Rule 9(b) requires specificity in the pleading of RICO mail and wire fraud [and] [t]his degree of specificity is no more nor less than we have required in fraud and securities fraud cases.” Id., 829 F.2d at 290 (citations omitted). In so holding, the Court wrote that:
Generally, there are three purposes behind Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirement: (1) to place the defendants on notice and enable them to prepare meaningful responses; (2) to preclude the use of a groundless fraud claim as a pretext to discovering a wrong or as a “strike suit”; and (3) to safeguard defendants from frivolous charges which might damage their reputations, [citations omitted]
Id., 829 F.2d at 289.
The Court specifically noted that in determining whether Rule 9(b) is satisfied, a Court must “keep in mind” these three major purposes of Rule 9(b).
Applying these principles to the case at bar, it becomes apparent that the Second Amended Complaint complies with the provisions of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. Therefore, I RECOMMEND that Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss The Amended Complaint (# 29) be deemed to seek dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint and that to the extent that the motion seeks dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint on the ground that it fails to plead fraud and misrepresentation with the requisite degree of particularity, the motion be DENIED.
First, all but two of the misrepresentations alleged in paragraph 11 (made before the written contract was executed) are alleged to have been made at either the “on-site demonstration” or the “off-site demonstration” or both. The dates and places of both the “on-site demonstration” and the “off-site demonstration” are stated with particularity in paragraph 8. The other two misrepresentations are alleged to have been made at “on-site visits.” Since “on-site” refers to the plaintiffs’ business premises, the place of the misrepresentations is pleaded with particularity. The time is specified in paragraph 8 as being within the three months period from July through September, 1985. In the circumstances, I view this as sufficient particularity.
Second, each of the alleged misrepresentations made after the written contract was signed are alleged to have been made in nine pieces of correspondence which are listed by date, sender, and recipient in paragraph 35 of the Second Amended Complaint. This is sufficient particularity as to time and place for the purposes of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.
Third, I view the allegations respecting misrepresentations made both before and after the written contract was executed as being sufficient when considering the purposes of Rule 9(b). The allegations give sufficient notice of the basis of the allegations of fraud to enable the defendant to prepare a meaningful response. In view of the sufficiency of the breach of contract claim which arises out of the same set of circumstances, it can hardly be said that the fraud claim is a pretext to discovering a wrong or that the fraud claim is being used as a “strike suit.” Roberts v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co., Inc., 653 F.Supp. 406, 415-16 (D.Mass., 1986). Lastly, the fraud claim cannot be labelled as frivolous.
Fourth, in view of what I have indicated regarding the sufficiency as to time and place of misrepresentations made at on-site and off-site demonstrations and at on-site visits and in correspondence, I do not find a violation of Rule 9(b) in the allegations that the same misrepresentations were also made in unspecified telephone calls between agents of the parties during the specified time periods. Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., is to be harmonized with Rule 8(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., which provides for a “short and plain statement of the claim.” There would be no harmony between the two rules if a plaintiff, in order to comply with Rule 9(b), had to list every time and place at which a specific misrepresentation was repeated.
Lastly, I do not see a violation of Rule 9(b) in the failure of the plaintiff to identify the specific agent of the defendant who made each misrepresentation. Although other courts have construed Rule 9(b) as requiring an identification of the maker of the misrepresentation, none of the First Circuit cases indicate that such identification is a prerequisite to compliance with Rule 9(b); all that is required is a specification of time, place and content. To be sure, I can envisage some circumstances in which an identification might well be required. For example, if a complaint alleged only a single misrepresentation by an agent of a defendant and specified the time, place and content but not the identity of the agent, it could well be argued that the defendant-corporation would need further specification in order to make a meaningful response to the claim. But the circumstances of the instant case are different. There appears to have been an extended period of dealings between the parties culminating in a written contract which both sides acknowledge as having executed. I cannot see how a specification of the identity of the defendant’s agents who allegedly made the misrepresentations is necessary in order for the defendant to understand the basis of the fraud claim and to be able to respond to it.

Expert analysis of the legal cases provided reveals that the rights of creditors Nelson and Elizabeth Torres to the payment of interest on Claim # 13 should be determined according to applicable state law. In this case, the Civil Code of Puerto Rico is relevant.

As stated in Article 1138 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, "In obligations to do, the debtor shall also be released when the prestation appears to be legally or physically impossible." However, as mentioned in Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48 (1979), the legal and physical impossibility contemplated by law are not present in this contested matter.

Furthermore, Article 1061 of the P.R.Civil Code provides that when the obligation consists in the payment of a sum of money, and the person incurs in default, the creditor is entitled to be indemnified for damages and losses suffered, which will consist in the payment of interest. In the absence of an agreed-upon interest rate, the legal interest rate at 6% per annum shall be applied, as stated in 11 U.S.C. Section 502(b)(2).

In reference to Bankruptcy Judge James F. Queenan, Jr.'s opinion in In re Prichard Plaza Associates Limited Partnership, 84 B.R. 289 (Bkrtcy.D.Mass.1988), the Court finds that Mr. Bonilla must reimburse the full amount of the option contract paid by Mr. Torres, plus interest at the legal rate of 6% per year, from the date the option contract expired to the date this petition was filed.

Also, considering the reference case 114 B.R. 326, U.S.C. § 363(b)(1), "Property of the estate" includes "all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case." However, in this case, the option contract was signed before the bankruptcy petition was filed, and the plot of land was sold after the filing with the authority of the Court.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of the legal cases provided, the Court concludes that the creditors Nelson and Elizabeth Torres are entitled to the payment of interest on Claim # 13, and the applicable interest rate is 6% per annum, as stated in 11 U.S.C. Section 502(b)(2).

In some title States, the mortgagee’s right to rents and profits may be exercised even prior to default, see Me. Rev. Stat.

Under its case law, a mortgagee is entitled to possession of the mortgaged property upon default, and need not await actual foreclosure. Such possession might be secured either with the consent of the mortgagor or by an action in ejectment. But so long as the mortgagor does remain in possession, even after default, he — not the mortgagee — appears to be entitled to the rents and profits. See Brannock v. Fletcher, 271 N. C. 65, 155 S.

U.S.C. § 363(b)(1). “Property of the estate” includes “all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.” 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1). It is “necessary to look to nonbankruptcy law, usually state law, to determine whether the debtor has any legal or equitable interest in any particular item.” 4 Collier on Bankruptcy, ¶ 541.02[1] at 541-13 (15th ed. 1989). Since “property interests are created and defined by state law,” such interests are analyzed under state law in bankruptcy proceedings unless “some federal interest requires a different result.” Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55, 99 S.Ct. 914, 918, 59 L.Ed.2d 136 (1979). See also In re Prichard Plaza Associates Ltd. Partnership, 84 B.R. 289, 293 (Bankr.D.Mass.1988). This Court’s resolution of the dispute over the debtor’s interest in Spectrum Wire is grounded in state corporations law, and takes into account the equitable powers of the bankruptcy court. However, in light of the bankruptcy court decision under review, this Court’s analysis of the appellants’ ownership interest in the Spectrum Wire stock must begin with a discussion of the Massachusetts law of trusts. A. Stock as the Subject Matter of an Express Trust The bankruptcy court found that conduct and verbal agreements by the debtor’s father “manifested an intention to hold in trust for the Debtor the shares of Spectrum stock standing in the father’s name.” In re MacDonald, 101 B.R. at 841.

order against the debtor. The automatic stay prevented any further action by the Bank, including service of the restraining order. The debtor has remained in physical possession and has continued to collect all of its rents. The Bank promptly filed with the bankruptcy court an emergency motion for relief from stay and for authority to continue with its possession and to collect the rents. The law was clarified by the United States Supreme Court in 1979 in the case of Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d 136, 4 B.C.D. 1259. The court held that: ... Congress has generally left the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt’s estate to state law. Property interests are created and defined by state law. Unless some federal interest requires a different result, there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding. Looking to Massachusetts law, an assignment of rent gives the mortgagee a valid security interest which becomes effective upon a default and an overt act by the mortgagee to take actual or constructive possession. Bankruptcy does not change the assignee/mortgagee’s right to the rent so long as possession was obtained pre-fil-ing, or a request is made to the bankruptcy-court for relief. The matter was further extensively analyzed by Bankruptcy Judge James F. Queenan, Jr. in the case of In re Prichard Plaza Associates Limited Partnership, 84 B.R. 289 (Bkrtcy.D.Mass.1988). For a

SARA E. de JESUS, Bankruptcy Judge.
The matter pending before the Court is whether creditors Nelson and Elizabeth Torres are entitled to the payment of interest on Claim # 13, and the applicable interest rate.
Pursuant to Debtor’s request for a valuation of claim # 13, we held an evidentiary hearing. The parties have agreed to the following facts:
“a. That on July 22, 1980, Nelson Torres Ruiz and Adrián Bonilla Montalvo signed an Option Contract for the purchase of a plot of land marked number twenty (20).
b. The price of said plot of land was $7,250.00, of which at the signing of the Option Contract, Nelson Torres Ruiz paid Adrián Bonilla Montalvo the sum of $500.00 and later that same day paid him $2,500.00 for a total of $3,000.00.
c. The Option Contract enumerated a period of two years from the date of signing within which the debtor, Adrián Bonilla Montalvo, was to execute the purchase deed or reimburse Nelson Torres Ruiz the sum of $3,000.00. ,
d. That Mr. Nelson Torres Ruiz was single when he entered into an option agreement for certain lot of land on July 22, 1980.
e. That Mr. Nelson Torres Ruiz gave Mr. Adrián Bonilla $3,000.00 as option money-
f. That debtor according to clause # 6 of the option contract is obliged, and has accepted to do so, to return to this creditor the $3,000.00.
g. That debtor has recognized the debt of $3,000.00 owed to Mr. Nelson Torres and has scheduled the same as $900.00 priority and $2,100.00 as general unsecured claim.
h. Mrs. Elizabeth Hermida de Torres married Mr. Nelson Torres Ruiz after the option contract was signed.
i. Mrs. Elizabeth Hermida de Torres was not a party to the option contract signed on July 22, 1980 by debtor and Mr. Nelson Torres.
j. .That on January 12, 1984, Mrs. Elizabeth Hermida de Torres was deputy clerk of the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, Courtroom of Mayaguez.
k. That Banco Comercial de Mayaguez filed suit number 81-1138 against debtor and his ex-wife on the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, Courtroom of Mayaguez.
l. That on June 7, 1983 Attorney Jovino Martinez wrote a letter to debtor on behalf of Mr. Nelson Torres requesting the return of the option money given by him to debt- or.
m. The plot of land where Mr. Nelson Torres had his option was sold after the filing for relief and with the authority of this Court.”
Two Joint Exhibits were also admitted: the Option contract executed by the Debtor and Nelson Torres on July 22, 1980; and a letter dated June 7, 1983 from Attorney Jovino Martinez Ramirez to Attorney Adrián Bonilla Montalvo requesting the return of the money paid by Mr. Torres plus legal interest.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
In bankruptcy, issues as to the validity and legality of a claim are determined pursuant to applicable state law. Thus, we must decide the question at hand by applying the pertinent Articles of the Civil Code of P.R.
The option contract executed by Debtor and Nelson Torres Ruiz, called for the execution of the deed of sale within two years from July 22, 1980. However, the contractual terms also required Mr. Bonilla to return the total price for the option, if he could not obtain the permits required by the local government allowing him to segregate and sell the optioned plot, within this same two year period. The contract does not mention interest payments.
The Debtor raises the defense of impossibility of compliance with the obligation in order to release himself from the obligation and/or any liability. Mr. Bonilla claims a legal and physical impossibility based on events which occured almost six years after the Option contract had expired, and, in any event, these events concern his fiscal or monetary problems. Article 1138 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, 31 Laws of P.R.Ann., Section 3193, provides that, “In obligations to do, the debtor shall also be released when the prestation appears to be legally or physically impossible.” However, Debtor’s reliance on this Article of the Civil Code is unwarranted inasmuch as the legal and physical impossibility contemplated by law are not present in this contested matter.
Article 1061 of the P.R.Civil Code, 31 Laws of P.R.Ann., Section 3025, provides that when the obligation consists in the payment of a sum of money, and the person incurs in default, the creditor is entitled to be indemnified for damages and losses suffered, which will consist in the payment of interest. If the parties failed to agree upon the payment of interest and or the interest rate, then the interest to be paid will be the legal interest at the applicable rate. Furthermore, “Until another rate is fixed by the Government, interest at the rate of six percent per annum shall be considered as legal.”
Under these circumstances, Mr. Bonilla must reimburse the full amount of the option contract paid by Mr. Torres, plus interest at the legal rate of 6% per year, from the date the option contract expired to the date this petition was filed, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 502(b)(2).
. During the hearing, Nelson Torres Ruiz and his wife Elizabeth waived their claims for damages other than interest discussed herein.
. 11 U.S.C. Section 502(c)(2).
. It was also undisputed that Debtor was not able to secure the government permits needed to segregate and sell the plot to the Optionee, and the deed of sale was never executed.
. The Court takes judicial notice that the petition for bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Code was entered on February 19, 1987; and that Nelson and Elizabeth Torres, filed proof of claim no. 13 in the amount of $25,-000.00. Attached thereto are the copies of the following documents: the option contract entered into by the debtor Adrián Bonilla Montal-vo and Nelson Torres Ruiz on July 22, 1980; the complaint filed by Mr. Torres Ruiz against the debtor before the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Part, Civil No. CS-88-896, for collection of money and damages; and a copy of a sworn statement of Nelson Torres Ruiz dated June 22, 1988.
.During the hearing the parties testified this suit was stayed by the filing of this petition.

In the context of the unseaworthiness doctrine, it is crucial to examine the provisions of both the bareboat charter and the time charter agreements. As previously established, the bareboat charter transferred full control and possession to Chaplin, making Chaplin the owner pro hoc vice and therefore responsible for the vessel’s seaworthiness at the time of the incident. Following the principles laid out in Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, and Morales v. City of Galveston, 370 U.S. 165, a ship’s gear, appurtenances, and manner of stowage must be reasonably fit for their intended purpose.

In addressing Plaintiff's allegations, it must be noted that the condition leading to the Plaintiff's injury must be attributable to the vessel's unseaworthy state rather than an isolated act of negligence by fellow crew members. As highlighted in 400 U.S. 494, an individual act of negligence does not render a vessel unseaworthy. Therefore, any claim of unseaworthiness must relate to inherent vessel deficiencies existing at the time of the charter’s inception or subsequently arising due to the charterer’s conduct.

With regards to the incineration barrel, the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to show that the vessel’s condition per 373 U.S. 206 was inherently unseaworthy at the time of the accident. The burn barrel itself does not appear to constitute an unseaworthy condition under the standards applied in earlier cases.

Based on the evidence and the precedents discussed, the movement for summary judgment by Chaplin on the grounds of unseaworthiness is not substantiated. Consequently, the motion for summary judgment by Mon River on grounds of the vessel's alleged unseaworthiness is GRANTED.

IV. 
In sum, the bareboat charter agreement effectively transferred ownership responsibilities to Chaplin, and no substantial evidence indicates unseaworthiness from Mon River’s side that would breach the express warranty concerning seaworthiness at delivery. Therefore, the court GRANTS the summary judgment for Mon River and DENIES Plaintiff's claim against Chaplin on the grounds presented.

It is so ordered.

Waterman Steamship Corp., 1963, 373 U.S. 206, 83 S.Ct. 1185, 10 L.Ed.2d 297, 1963 A.M.C. 1649, the Supreme Court concluded that ‘things about a ship, whether the hull, the decks, the machinery, the tools furnished, the stowage, or the cargo containers, must be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are to be used.’ Id. at 213, 83 S.Ct. at 1190, 10 L.Ed.2d at 303. More recently, in Usner v. Luckenbach, 1971, 400 U.S. 494, 91 S.Ct. 514, 27 L.Ed.2d 562, 1971 A.M.C. 277, the Supreme Court said that: ‘A vessel’s condition of unseaworthiness might arise from any number of circumstances. Her gear might be defective, her appurtenances might be in disrepair, her crew unfit. The number of men assigned to perform a shipboard task might be insufficient. The method of loading her cargo, or the manner of its stowage, might be improper. For any of these reasons, or others, a vessel might not be reasonably fit for her intended service.’ Id. at 499, 91 S.Ct. at 517-18, 27 L.Ed.2d at 562.”

which is in essence that things about a ship, whether the hull, the decks, the machinery, the tools furnished, the stowage, or the cargo containers, must be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are to be used. See Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U. S. 539, 550; Morales v. City of Galveston, 370 U. S. 165, 169, 172 (dissenting opinion). A ship that leaks is unseaworthy; so is a cargo container that leaks. When the shipowner accepts cargo in a faulty container or allows the container to become faulty, he assumes the responsibility for injury that this may cause to seamen or their substitutes on or about the ship. Beans belong inside their containers, and anyone should know, as the trial court found, that serious injury may result if they get out of their containers and get underfoot. These bean bags were unfit and thus unseaworthy. The second question is one of first impression in this Court, although other federal courts have already recognized that the case law compels this conclusion. Strika v. Netherlands Ministry of Traffic, 185 F. 2d 555 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Robillard v. A. L. Burbank & Co., 186 F. Supp. 193 (S. D. N. Y.); see Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Cordray, 258 F. 2d 214, 218 (C. A. 9th Cir.). In Strika, while the longshoreman was working on the dock, use of an improper wire cable caused a hatch cover to fall on him. Building on such cases as O’Donnell v.

reference_case_2: 400 U.S. 494

our cases have held that the scope of unseaworthiness is by no means so limited. A vessel’s condition of unseaworthiness might arise from any number of circumstances. Her gear might be defective, her appurtenances in disrepair, her crew unfit. The number of men assigned to perform a shipboard task might be insufficient. The method of loading her cargo, or the manner of its stowage, might be improper. For any of these reasons, or others, a vessel might not be reasonably fit for her intended service. What caused the petitioner’s injuries in the present case, however, was not the condition of the ship, her appurtenances, her cargo, or her crew, but the isolated, personal negligent act of the petitioner’s fellow longshoreman. To hold that this individual act of negligence rendered the ship unseaworthy would be' to subvert the fundamental distinction between unseaworthiness and negligence that we have so painstakingly and repeatedly emphasized in our decisions. In Trawler Racer, supra, there existed a condition of unseaworthiness,, and we held it was error to require a finding of negligent conduct in order to hold the shipowner liable. The case before us-presents the other side of the same coin. For it would be equally erroneous here, where no condition of unseaworthiness existed, to hold the shipowner liable for a third party’s single and wholly unforeseeable act of negligence. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. It is so ordered.' 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (b) provides as follows: Compare Candiano v.

HADEN, Chief Judge.
Pending is the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants Chaplin Marine Transport, Inc. (“Chaplin”) and Mon River Towing, Inc. (“Mon River”). Plaintiff has responded and Defendants have replied. This issue is ripe for adjudication.
Plaintiff initiated this action on May 28, 1993. He filed an amended complaint on December 7,1994. Plaintiff contends he was injured while working on the MTV Lillian G, a tow boat, on November 25,1992. The Lillian G is owned by Mon River, but was being operated pursuant to a bareboat, or demise charter by Chaplin. In turn, Chaplin was operating the boat pursuant to a purported time charter between it and Mon River. Plaintiff contends he was following the common practice of his employer, Chaplin, when he was seriously burned as he attempted to incinerate garbage in a barrel located on the deck of the vessel. He asserts Mon River was aware of the presence and use of the barrel to burn garbage at the time of the incident. Plaintiff asserts causes of action based upon this Court’s admiralty jurisdiction and the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.App. § 688.
I.
Defendants contend they are entitled to summary judgment. The standard used to determine whether a motion for summary judgment should be granted or denied is stated by our Court of Appeals as follows:
“A moving party is entitled to summary judgment ‘if the pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’ Fed R.Civ.Pro. 56(c). See Charbonnages de France v. Smith, 597 F.2d 406 (4th Cir.1979).
“A genuine issue of material fact exists ‘if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmov-ing party.’ Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In considering a motion for summary judgement, the court is required to view the facts and draw reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id. at 255, 106 S.Ct. at 2513-14. The plaintiff is entitled to have the credibility of all his evidence presumed. Miller v. Leathers, 913 F.2d 1085, 1087 (4th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1109, 111 S.Ct. 1018, 112 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1991). The party seeking summary judgment has the initial burden to show absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553-54, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The opposing party must demonstrate that a triable issue of fact exists; he may not rest upon mere allegations or denials. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510. A mere scintilla of evidence supporting the ease is insufficient. Id.” Shaw v. Stroud, 13 F.3d 791, 798 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 67, 130 L.Ed.2d 24, and cert. denied, — U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 68, 130 L.Ed.2d 24 (1994).
Accord, McCoy v. United Postal Service, 890 F.Supp. 529, 531 n. 3 (S.D.W.Va.1995) (Haden, C.J.); Browning v. Snead, 886 F.Supp. 547, 549-50 (S.D.W.Va.1995) (Haden, C.J.).
II.
Mon River asserts it is not liable for any negligence occurring on or unseaworthiness of the Lillian G. It relies on the bareboat charter agreement between it and Chaplin. It claims the bareboat charter turns exclusive control, operation and navigation of the vessel over to Chaplin, thus relieving it of responsibility for Plaintiffs injuries. For the reasons that follow the Court agrees.
The owner of a vessel is normally liable for injuries caused by the vessel’s un seaworthiness. McAleer v. Smith, 57 F.3d 109, 111-12 (1st Cir.1995), citing, Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 90, 66 S.Ct. 872, 875, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946) (citing, The Osceola, 189 U.S. 158, 23 S.Ct. 483, 47 L.Ed. 760 (1903)); Moore v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 912 F.2d 789, 792 (5th Cir.1990) (“The vessel owner remains responsible for the seaworthiness of the vessel[.]”).
Nonetheless, an owner may turn the exclusive possession, control and navigation over to another party through a bare-boat, or demise charter. A bareboat charter is
“created when ‘the owner of the vessel .-.. completely and exclusively relinquishes] possession, command, and navigation thereof to the demisee. [They are] therefore tantamount to, though just short of, an outright transfer of ownership. However, anything short of such a complete transfer is a time or voyage charter party or not a charter party at all.’ ” McAleer v. Smith, supra, 57 F.3d at 113, citing, Guzman v. Pichirilo, 369 U.S. 698, 699-700, 82 S.Ct. 1095, 1096, 8 L.Ed.2d 205 (1962) (internal quotation and citation omitted).
See Wheatley v. Gladden, 660 F.2d 1024, 1026 (4th Cir.1981) (“Under a bareboat charter the charterer assumes all the obligations of ownership, including those of the employer and crew. United States v. W.M. Webb, Inc., [397 U.S. 179, 90 S.Ct. 850, 25 L.Ed.2d 207 (1970) ]. The test for establishing a bareboat charter is one of control — has the owner completely relinquished possession and command of the boat.”); Carolina Seafoods, Inc. v. United States, 581 F.2d 1098, 1100 (4th Cir.1978). The charterer under a bareboat or demise charter thus stands in the shoes of the owner and becomes the owner pro hoc vice. Because the bareboat charterer stands in the shoes of the owner, the bareboat charterer assumes the duties and responsibilities appurtenant to ownership, and the owner is relieved of the same. As stated recently in Dow Chemical Co. v. Texaco Refining and Marketing, Inc., 887 F.Supp. 853, 863, (E.D.Va.1995):
“Under a bareboat or demise charter, full possession and control of the chartered vessel is turned over to the charterer. Reed v. S.S. Yaka, 373 U.S. 410, 412, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 1351, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963) (‘It has long been recognized in the law of admiralty that for many, if not most purposes the bareboat charterer is to be treated as the owner, generally called the owner pro hoc vice.’); Alex L. Parks & Edward V. Cattel, Jr., The Law of Tug, Tow & Pilotage 875 (3d ed.1994). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has stated:
This rule recognizes that when the owner of the vessel enters into a demise charter, he surrenders all possession and control of the vessel to the charterer. Since he no longer has the right to control the use of the vessel, he is no longer charged with the duties and liabilities of its ownership. Conversely, the demise charterer ‘becomes subject to the duties and responsibilities of ownership.’
Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Law, 479 F.2d 61, 63 (4th Cir.1973) (quoting Leary v. United States, 81 U.S. (14 Wall) 607, 610, 20 L.Ed. 756 (1872)). As a bareboat charterer, the charterer is held to be a bailee of the vessel. Richmond Sand & Gravel Corp. v. Tidewater Constr. Corp., 170 F.2d 392, 393 (4th Cir.1948); 2b Benedict on Admiralty § 51, at 3-3 (1995).”
See Forrester v. Ocean Marine Indem. Co., 11 F.3d 1213, 1215 (5th Cir.1993) (“In a demise charter, the vessel owner transfers full possession and control to the charterer, who in turn furnishes the crew and maintenance for the vessel (thus the term ‘bare-boat’).”). And as stated in Wolsiffer v. Atlantis Submarines, Inc., 848 F.Supp. 1489, 1494 (D.Haw.1994):
“In order for the agreement to be considered a demise charter, complete transfer of possession, command, and navigation of the vessel from the owner to the charterer is necessary. Guzman v. Pichirilo, 369 U.S. 698, 700, 82 S.Ct. 1095, 1096-97, 8 L.Ed.2d 205 (1962); Gaspard v. Diamond M. Drilling Co., 593 F.2d 605, 606 (5th Cir.1979). ‘Anything short of ... a complete transfer is a time or voyage charter party or not a charter party at all.’ Guzman, 369 U.S. at 700, 82 S.Ct. at 1096. Courts are reluctant to find a demise char ter when the dealings between the parties are consistent with any lesser relationship.”
The owner of a vessel impliedly warrants its seaworthiness to the point of delivery to the bareboat charterer. Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Law, 479 F.2d 61 (4th Cir.1973); Dow Chemical Co. v. Texaco Refining and Marketing, Inc., 887 F.Supp. at 864, citing, Dempsey v. Downing, 11 F.2d 15, 17 (4th Cir.1926); In the Matter of D & H Corp., 1994 WL 574143, *1 (E.D.Va.1993); Cos v. French-Polish Shipping Co., 1986 WL 13361, *1 (D.Md.1986); Interocean Shipping Co. v. M/V Lygaria, 512 F.Supp. 960 (D.Md.1981). If the vessel was unseaworthy when delivered, the owner is liable for injuries caused by such unseaworthiness notwithstanding the existence of the bareboat charter. If the vessel is seaworthy upon delivery, the bareboat charterer then assumes the responsibilities of the owner for liability for injuries thereafter caused by the unseaworthiness of the vessel. McAleer v. Smith, supra, 57 F.3d at 112 (“In general, if there is an owner pro hac vice, the title owner will be absolved of personal liability (except for defective conditions that existed before the owner pro hac vice took control of the vessel).”); Forrester v. Ocean Marine Indem. Co., 11 F.3d at 1215 (“The demise charterer is ... responsible in personam for the negligence of the crew and the unseaworthiness of the vessel.”); Wolsiffer v. Atlantis Submarines, Inc., 848 F.Supp. at 1494 (“The remedy of unseaworthiness for an injured seaman applies in rem against the vessel and in personam against either the title owner of the vessel ..., or the owner pro hac vice under a demise charter.” (citation omitted).).
Plaintiff acknowledges the existence of the bareboat charter agreement and does not dispute the bareboat agreement has the effect of giving Chaplin the status of owner pro hac vice. Plaintiff argues Mon River is liable for the alleged unseaworthiness of the vessel, however, by virtue of the “charter party” agreement executed between Chaplin and Mon River the same day the bareboat charter agreement was executed. Plaintiff argues that pursuant to the charter party agreement, Mon River controlled Chaplin and the vessel, and is thus liable for its alleged unseaworthiness. Defendants, on the other hand, contend the agreement was a “time charter” agreement that left control and possession of the vessel solely in the hands of Chaplin, the pro hac vice owner under the bareboat agreement.
The second agreement entered into by the parties is entitled “Charter Party.” In the first paragraph of the agreement, the contract purports to be a “Time Charter.” Plaintiff acknowledges the time charter did not place any responsibility upon Mon River to furnish the crew or man the vessel. Instead, he relies only on paragraph six of the agreement, which states:
“6. REPORTS: Chaplin shall require that the master of the towboat report daily by radio the position of the tow and any other information that it is requested by [Mon River] regarding the status of the barges that it has or has had in tow. Chaplin shall require that the master of the towboat report weekly by radio the engine hours of the two main engines and the two generator engines on the boat. Chaplin shall furnish to Mon River copies of all purchases of fuel oil, lubricating oil and hydraulic oil which are purchased for consumption aboard the towboat M/V Lillian G. Mon River Towing will pay said vendors of such oils directly.”
Plaintiff suggests the foregoing, combined with his contention that the vessel frequently refueled and underwent engine maintenance at a location operated by Mon River, is enough to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the control of the vessel for liability purposes. The Court disagrees.
In contrast to a bareboat charter, a time charter does not vest operational control in the time charterer. Instead, the time charterer directs the destinations of the vessel without assuming any responsibility for the actual operation of the ship. Therefore, the time charterer is not held hable for the negligence of the crew or the unseaworthiness of the vessel. As stated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit:
“A time charter only entitles the charterer to the use of the vessel for a specified time. The vessel owner retains primary possession and control. Although a time charterer does direct the destinations of the vessel, he does not control the details of vessel operation required to reach those destinations. As a non-demise charterer, the time charterer is thus not liable for claims of negligence of the crew or for the unseaworthiness of the vessel. But the time charterer may be liable in that capacity for his own negligence.” (footnotes omitted and emphasis added). Forrester v. Ocean Marine Indem. Co., 11 F.3d at 1215.
In Moore v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 912 F.2d at 791-92, the Court distinguished the responsibilities of time charterers from those of owners as follows:
“Under the traditional time-charter agreement, the time charterer directs the vessel’s commercial activities. It may designate the cargo to be carried and determine the vessel’s routes and destinations. * * * The time charterer’s duties are different from the vessel owner’s duties. The vessel owner remains responsible for the seaworthiness of the vessel, e.g., Nichimen Co. v. M.V. Farland, 462 F.2d 319, 331 (2nd Cir.1972), dangerous conditions on board, e.g., Migut v. Hyman-Michaels Co., 571 F.2d 352, 356 (6th Cir.1978), navigational errors by the pilot and negligence by the crew, e.g., Delta Transload, Inc. v. MV Navios Commander, 818 F.2d 445, 451 (5th Cir.1987), and a reasonably safe means of access for those boarding or leaving the vessel, see, e.g., Tittle v. Aldacosta, 544 F.2d 752, 755 (5th Cir.1977) [.]”
See Wolsiffer v. Atlantis Submarines, Inc., 848 F.Supp. at 1494; Roby v. Hyundai Merchant Marine, 700 F.Supp. 316, 320-21 (E.D.La.1988); Vlachos v. M/V Proso, 637 F.Supp. 1354, 1364 n. 14 (D.Md.1986).
As noted above, the Plaintiff acknowledges the delegation of responsibilities pursuant to the bareboat charter. Under said agreement, Mon River transferred possession, control and command of the Lillian G to Chaplin. Chaplin thus became the pro hoc vice owner of the vessel, legally responsible for the unseaworthiness of the vessel after the date of transfer. Chaplin, in turn, executed a purported time charter agreement with Mon River. Although Plaintiff argues the time charter had the effect of a demise charter transferring control over the vessel back to Mon River, the Court disagrees.
In essence, it appears Plaintiff is arguing Chaplin, after becoming the bareboat charterer and pro hac vice owner, executed a bareboat charter back to Mon River, making Mon River both paper owner and pro hac vice owner of the vessel. The Court notes the following: first, Plaintiff does not dispute Chaplin was a bareboat charterer under the first agreement, and therefore pro hac vice owner of the vessel; second, in regard to the second agreement between Chaplin and Mon River a time charter, rather than a bareboat charter, is presumed to exist as a matter of law and such presumption may be overcome only by specific facts showing a demise charter existed, Wolsijfer, supra, 848 F.Supp. at 1494, citing Gaspard v. Diamond M. Drilling Co., 593 F.2d 605, 607 (5th Cir.1979); third, the charter is an unrebutted time charter.
Plaintiff has been unable to present specific facts showing a demise charter was executed between Chaplin and Mon River after Mon River demised the vessel to Chaplin. The Court thus concludes the time charter is precisely what it purports to be. Therefore, because Chaplin, the pro hac vice owner of the boat, was responsible for the seaworthiness of the vessel on the date of the Plaintiff’s injury, the Court GRANTS Mon River’s motion for summary judgment on the unseaworthiness claim against it.
III.
Chaplin contends it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff failed to produce evidence the vessel was unseaworthy or that Chaplin was negligent. Plaintiff has attached several portions of depositions he asserts create a question of material fact regarding the seaworthiness of the Lillian G at the time of the incident and of Chaplin’s negligence.
Claims of negligence under the Jones Act or of unseaworthiness subject the plaintiff to a light burden of proof. As stated by the Court of Appeals in Estate of Larkins v. Farrell Lines, Inc., 806 F.2d 510, 512 (4th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1037, 107 S.Ct. 1973, 95 L.Ed.2d 814 (1987):
“Under the Jones Act, the standard of recovery has not been a strict one, and seamen have been afforded the ‘judicially developed doctrine of liability granted to railroad workers by the FELA,’ Kernan v. American Dredging Co., 355 U.S. 426, 439, 78 S.Ct. 394, 401, 2 L.Ed.2d 382 (1958), including its light burden of proof on negligence and causation. While the standard of causation for unseaworthiness is ‘more demanding,’ Chisholm v. Sabine Towing and Transportation Co., 679 F.2d 60, 62 (5th Cir.1982), the plaintiff’s burden in either case has been characterized as light. Vallot v. Central Gulf Lines, 641 F.2d 347, 350 (5th Cir.1981). The jury’s role, moreover, has been an important one in such cases, and doubts have been resolved in favor of submission.”
A.
A comprehensive but concise overview of an owner’s responsibility for a vessel’s seaworthiness was provided in Drachenberg v. Canal Barge Co., Inc., 571 F.2d 912, 918 (5th Cir.1978):
“The owner of the vessel has a duty to provide a vessel that is reasonably fit for its intended use. This duty to provide a seaworthy vessel requires that the vessel, its gear, appurtenances, and operation must be reasonably safe. Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki 1946, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099, 1946 A.M.C. 698. ‘That (a vessel) owner is liable to indemnify a seaman for an injury caused by the unseaworthiness of the vessel or its appurtenant appliances and equipment has been settled law in this country ever since The Osceola, 189 U.S. 158, 23 S.Ct. 483, 47 L.Ed. 760; Mahnich v. Southern S.S. Co., 321 U.S. 96, 99, 64 S.Ct. 455, [457] 88 L.Ed. 561, 564, [ (1944) ] and authorities cited.’ Id. at 90, 66 S.Ct. 872, at 875, 90 L.Ed. at 1103.

{label: [2]}. This does not include a 3 because the generation claims "the vessel’s condition per 373 U.S. 206 was inherently unseaworthy at the time of the accident. The burn barrel itself does not appear to constitute an unseaworthy condition ", while the target claims "‘things about a ship, whether the hull, the decks, the machinery, the tools furnished, the stowage, or the cargo containers, must be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are to be used.’ Id. at 213, 83 S.Ct. at 1190, 10 L.Ed.2d at 303. More recently, in Usner v. Luckenbach, 1971, 400 U.S. 494, 91 S.Ct. 514, 27 L.Ed.2d 562, 1971 A.M.C. 277, the Supreme Court said that: ‘A vessel’s condition of unseaworthiness might arise from any number of circumstances. Her gear might be defective, her appurtenances might be in disrepair, her crew unfit. The number of men assigned to perform a shipboard task might be insufficient. The method of loading her cargo, or the manner of its stowage, might be improper. For any of these reasons, or others, a vessel might not be reasonably fit for her intended service.’". The target is basically saying that the ship must be proven "seaworthy" - so the generation does not really mismatch with the citation content. Therefore it should only be [2].

Looking at the present bill, it appears that the receiver is attempting to circumvent the established legal framework which explicitly requires actions to be brought in a certain manner. According to the reference cases 8 Wall. 498 and 19 L. Ed. 476, the receiver, as the statutory assignee, holds the proper authority to institute suits both at law and in equity, representing the association and creditors alike without needing to make either a party to the suit.

Furthermore, as highlighted in 38 S. Ct. 38 and 62 L. Ed. 185, the liability of each stockholder constitutes a separate controversy, reducing the necessity for equity jurisdiction. The courts have consistently held, as noted in 8 Wall. 505 and 179 F. 32, that the receiver must proceed through appropriate legal channels rather than seeking to enforce stock subscriptions in this manner.

Notably, in 23 L. Ed. 220, similar principles were applied, emphasizing the requirement of proceeding through statutory methods rather than ancillary suits. The court has repeatedly insisted on adherence to legal forms and prescribed remedies, making the dismissal of the current bill consistent with established precedents.

In summation, the dismissal aligns with the necessity to respect the statutory roles and jurisdictional boundaries, reinforcing that the proper course for the receiver is to petition within the existing receivership suit. This method ensures procedural compliance and equitable resolution without overstepping the bounds of legal practice.

If they choose to rest supine until cases against them like this are on trial, they must take the consequences.

Thus elements essential to jurisdiction in equity to avoid multiplicity of actions at law by the corporations were lacking. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. McKnight, 244 U.

The amendment of 1910 to § 47 of the Bankruptcy Act did not confer new means of collecting ordinary claims due the bankrupt; and the order directing the trustee “to institute a suit in equity” was impotent to confer equity jurisdiction.

stock and the enforcement of an assessment less than his total liability, such as is disclosed in the present case. It is true that in Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498, 19 L. Ed. 476, which was a suit by a receiver of an insolvent national bank, appointed under the national banking act of June 3, 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 99, to enforce the personal liability of some of the stockholders, the court said: “The liability of the stockholders is several and not joint. The limit of their liability is the par of the stock held by each one. Where the whole amount is sought to be recovered the proceeding must be at law. Where less is required the proceeding may be in equity, and in such case an interlocutory decree may be taken for contribution, and the case may stand over for the further action of the court — if such action should subsequently prove to be necessary — until the full amount of the liability is exhausted.” This statement was unnecessary to the determination of the question before the court, as the bill sought to enforce the full statutory liability, and the case was decided on the ground that it did not appear that the comptroller of the currency had taken any action touching the enforcement of the personal liability of the stockholders. -Further, the pasáage must be read in the light of the law and facts there involved, and when so read is inapplicable to the

This is an ap- . peal from a decree dismissing a bill, called an ancillary bill, brought by the receiver of the Midland Packing Company against a large number of defendants, to enforce collection from them on their alleged unpaid stock subscriptions in said company. A brief outline of the facts leading up to the present bill is as follows:
The Midland Packing Company was organized under the laws of the state of Iowa in 1918 to carry on a general meat-packing business. The original authorized capital stock was $3,500,000. By an amendment to its articles, this was increased to $8,000,000. About $3,000,00 of the stock was purchased and paid for; $5,000,000 more was subscribed for, on which about $2,000,000 was paid, leaving approximately $3,000,000 unpaid on the stock subscriptions. In connection with these subscriptions for stock," cash payments were generally made for part of the purchase price, and promissory notes were given for the balance. These-notes to an amount of more than $1,000,000 were negotiated by the Midland Packing Company, either by way of sale or by way-of pledge, and to a very large amount they are still outstanding. The company built a. packing plant at Sioux City, Iowa, at a cost of over $3,000,000.
In April, 1920, Peter Hegnes, a citizen of South Dakota, brought a suit in equity in the federal court for the Northern District of Iowa against the Midland Packing Company, alleging that he was a stockholder in the company; that the company had. by fraud secured promissory notes from. him and from many others for the purchase of stock in the company; that the company was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency; that it had no funds on hand for a working capital. He prayed for a rescission of the contract of purchase of the stock, for an injunction against the sale of the promissory notes given by him, for a receiver for the company, and for general relief. A general receiver was appointed' by the court, and possession was taken by him of all the assets of the company for the purpose of winding up its affairs as an insolvent corporation. The receivership thus inaugurated still continues, the assets of the company have been largely collected, claims have been filed and allowed, and the affairs of the company generally administered.
In 1922, the receiver, McMillan, commenced a suit in the court of his appointment, called an ancillary suit, against a large number of defendants, divided by the bill into two classes, stockholder defendants and creditor defendants. The bill alleged that the stockholder defendants had each entered into a contract for the purchase of stock in the Midland Packing Company; “that at the time of entering into said eon-tracts each of the said stockholder defendants executed and delivered to the Midland Packing Company his promissory note or notes for the unpaid balance of the stock so subscribed for by him, and that a large part of the notes so executed and received by the said company were indorsed by it, and sold and transferred, in the due course of business, to the creditor defendants, * * * who are now the owners and holders thereof in due course.” The hill further alleged that part of the notes were held by the creditor defendants as collateral security for money loaned to the Midland Packing Company; that claims aggregating $2,173,-477 had been filed against the company in the receivership proceedings and had been approved; that the total claims filed amounted approximately to $3,400,270; that the total amount of unpaid notes on the subscriptions to. the stock of the company was $3,062,650, of which amount about 50 per cent, was uncollectable; that the plant of the company could not be sold for more than 50 per cent, of its actual appraised value, $2,522,931.
The prayer was “that the amount due and owing from each of the said stockholder defendants, on their several contracts, referred to in this bill of complaint, be ascertained and established by the court, for the several amounts, as shown by Schedule A, or for, such amounts as the court shall find to be due from them, and that the judgment and decree of this court be rendered against e'ach of said defendants for the amount so found to be due from them, and that the assets be marshaled and equitably distributed, so as to equalize the loss among the' stockholders, and for such further decree in that hehalf as shall preserve the rights of all the parties interested therein,- * * * and that each and all of the said creditor defendants be required to bring into court and surrender to the receiver each and all of the notes so held by them, or either or any of them, to the end that the notes may be fully accounted for and b& surrendered to the stockholder defendants upon payment thereof, or surrendered for cancellation in connection with any judgment or decree that may be entered herein against them, and the plaintiff prays such other and further relief as the court may deem just and equitable in the premises.”
It was held by this court (Carey v. McMillan, 289 F. 380) that thei hill should be dismissed. The court in its opinion said:
“To sum np: The demand made against each defendant being/purely legal, each demand being independent of every other, the amount demanded against each being the full amount unpaid on the stock, no accounting being necessary, no contribution being necessary, community of interest of the defendants in all the important questions of law and fact involved not being shown and being highly improbable, we are of opinion that the bare multiplicity of suits is not sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to entertain the present bill in equity. The plain and adequate remedy at law open to the receiver is to bring ancillary actions at law in the federal court against the several defendants whose notes he holds. When the pleadings are made up, if it is found feasible and desirable to consolidate the suits into one or several groups for trial, the power of the court is ample for that purpose. The convenience of the parties can thus he served, the cost of the litigation need not by appreciably greater, and the right of trial by jury will be preserved.”
In 1923 a suit in equity was brought in the same court by John A. Reagan, as trustee, against the same defendants (stock subscribers) as in the McMillan hill. Reagan alleged in his bill that he was a judgment creditor, having obtained a judgment in the state court of Iowa upon the indorsement of certain promissory notes by the Midland Packing Company which were made to it by subscribers to its stock; that execution had been returned unsatisfied; that the company was insolvent; that claims existed against the company, of th& same class as plaintiff’s claim, amounting to more than $1,750,000; that there were other claims, of a class inferior, amounting to more than $2,000,000; that the receiver had sold the plant and other assets, and had collected sufficient proceeds to pay 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, to creditors of the same class as plaintiff. ■
The prayer of the bill was “for an accounting to fix and determine the assets and liabilities of the Midland Packing Company and the amount of its unpaid stock subscriptions, and that the court shall fix and determine the percentage of his unpaid stock subscriptions which each defendant stockholder, shall pay, and the amount of the fair and equitable contribution of each defendant herein for the payment of the debts of said corporation, and that by said decree judgment shall be rendered and entered against each defendant for a sufficient amount of his unpaid stock subscriptions to in the aggregate pay the claim of this plaintiff against the Midland Packing Company, and those of all other creditors similarly situated, together with interest and its costs and disbursement^ in this action, and that it may have decree for such other and further relief as shall seem just and equitable in the premises.”
The court below dismissed the bill, on the ground that, since there was a receiver already in possession of the assets of the company and administering the same, the suit by Reagan would be an interference with the possession ■ of the court, and therefore could not be maintained. 298 F. 500. This judgment of dismissal was affirmed by this court in Reagan v. Midland Packing Co., 8 F. (2d) 954, decision filed September 30, 1925.
In 1924 after the dismissal of the Reagan suit in the lower court, the present suit was brought by the receiver against the same defendants (stock subscribers) as in the McMillan and Reagan bills. The bill alleges the history'of the company and the issue of its stock as above set forth, the insolvency of the company, the appointment of the receiver, and the administration by him of the assets of the company, the collection of proceeds sufficient to pay 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, to general creditors, whose claims have been allowed, and the existence of the unpaid stock subscriptions. The prayer is substantially the same as in the Reagan bill above quoted. The present bill was dismissed by the trial court.
It is claimed by the appellees that the decision in Carey v. McMillan (C. C. A.) 289 F. 380, is decisive of the present suit,, and that the question of the inability of the receiver to maintain the present suit is res ad judicata. Appellant claims that there are radical differences between the allegations of the bill in the McMillan suit and those in the present bill, and that the decision in the former suit is in no way opposed to the maintenance of the present one.
There are, it is true, numerous differences between, the bill in the McMillan suit and the present bill. Some of them consist of different allegations in reference to the same subject-matter; some of them consist in omitting altogether from the present bill' allegations found in the McMillan bill. The parties defendant are not strictly tlie same. In the McMillan suit not only the subscribers to stock were made defendants, but also-the holders of notes given by such subscribers to the Midland Packing Company for the purchase of stock, and which notes had been negotiated by the Midland Packing Company, either by a sale outright or by being pledged as collateral to debts of the Midland Packing Company. In the present suit these creditor defendants have been omitted. In the present suit there is an additional defendant, the Midland Packing Company.
In the McMillan suit it was alleged that claims had been filed in “the amount of $3,-400,270, and that claims had been approved to the amount of $2,173,477. In the present bill, the claims approved are stated to-amount to $1,760,000, a difference of $413,r 000. No explanation is given in the bill' of this difference in. amount of approved claims. In the McMillan bill it is stated that notes had been given in part payment for the stock subscribed by the defendant stockholders. No such allegation is found in the present bill. The present suit is based, in theory at least, not upon the notes,, but upon the stock subscriptions.
In the McMillan 'bill it was alleged that of the notes outstanding, given by stock subscribers in Iowa, $247,876 were held and owned by the receiver, whieh left upwards of $1,000,000 either owned or held as collateral by third parties. In the present bill it is stated that the stock subscriptions are in the possession of the receiver, but it is not stated whether any of the notes given in connection with stock subscriptions are in the possession or under the control of said receiver. In the McMillan hill it is stated that probably less than 50 per cent, of the notes given in connection with stock subscriptions were collectable. In tbe present bill nothing is said as to tbe amount of uncollectable notes or uneollectable stock subscriptions.
Nowhere in the present bill is it stated directly that less than the full amount owing on the stock subscriptions wiE be necessary in order to pay the debts and the administration expenses. It is sought, however, to have the inference drawn from the allegations in reference to the necessity for assessments that the total amount due on the subscriptions will not be neeessary. In the MeMillan bill, it is stated unequivocally that the fuE .amount due on the notes given in connection with stock subscriptions will be necessary in orders to meet tbe debts and administration expenses.
No explanation is found in the present bill of these vital differences in the statement of facts in the two bills. No reason is given in tbe present bill for tbe omission to state important facts which appear in the MeMillan bill, and which have a bearing on the propriety of maintaining the present suit. Both the MeMiEan bill and the present bill are verified. The court below, in determining tbe motion to dismiss, doubtless considered tbe allegations of the McMillan biE, so- far as they supplemented $he allegations of the present bill, and so far as they were relevant to the question of tbe propriety of maintaining tbe present suit. Both bills are of record in this court, and we are at liberty to consider them both in passing upon the action of the court below.
When the present bill is considered in tbe light of the unexplained and unchallenged allegations of fact in the MeMiEan bill, we think there is much basis for the contention that the question of the maintenance of the present suit is governed by the decision in the McMillan suit. See Sapulpa Petroleum Co. v. McCray (C. C. A.) 4 F.(2d) 645. But it is contended that the allegations of the present bill only should be considered, in determining the propriety of the present suit, and that, when the present hill is considered independently, several important facts show the necessity for the present suit: (1) That the liability on the stock subscriptions, and hot on the promissory notes given in connection therewith, is sought to be enforced; (2) that the whole amount of liability is not sought to be enforced, but only sucb proportional part as tbe court shall determine is neeessary; (3) that an accounting is necessary to determine the assets and liabilities of tbe company, tbe creditors» who are entitled to share in the fund to be created by tbe collection of the unpaid subscriptions, and the percentage neeessary to be paid by each subscriber on the unpaid balance on his subscription in order to meet the claims of creditors; and (4) that such an accounting can he had only in a court of equity. We do not think that any or aE of these contentions justify the maintenance of the present suit. We do not, however, find it necessary to decide whether the question of such maintenance is res adjudicata by reason of the decision in Carey v. McMillan (C. C. A.) 289 F. 380, nor do we find it necessary to determine whether the Eahility of the stock subscribers should be determined in suits on the promissory notes given by them or on the stock subscription contracts. The demand in either instance is a legal one, and the character of the demand is not changed by reason of the fact that the liability of the defendants may not have to be enforced to the full extent.
The real question is whether, in view-of all the facts, the bringing of the present bill by the receiver is in accordance with proper practice.

But a suit in equity is already pending in the same court in which the present bill is brought. The Midland Packing Company is a party to that suit. All of the above steps can be taken in that existing receivership suit on a petition by the receiver. The stockholders are not necessary formal parties to such proceedings.

{label: [1, 2, 3]}. This is a 1 because it mismatches the standard legal citation format. For example "38 S. Ct. 38 and 62 L. Ed. 185" should be written as "38 S. Ct. 38, 62 L.

Section 455(a) of 28 U.S.C. mandates that any justice, judge, or magistrate must disqualify themselves in any proceeding where their impartiality may reasonably be questioned. Similar principles were applied in the case referenced as 261 F.3d 1075, where motions for recusal were denied based on the argument of perceived partiality due to earlier rulings and a law clerk’s previous employment at a related law firm. This case emphasizes that impartiality must be assessed based on reasonableness and factual basis.

Moreover, the Supreme Court in 384 U.S. 563 reaffirmed the essential principle that bias and prejudice necessitating recusal must stem from an extrajudicial source, not from a judge's participation in the case or their judicial conduct therein. In my questioning of Ms. Gwynn's compliance with the Local Rules, there was no external influence or bias; rather, the actions were within judicial discretion to ensure adherence to procedural norms.

Given these precedents, none of Ms. Gwynn’s allegations meet the statutory or jurisprudential threshold for recusal under 28 U.S.C. § 455. The mere fact that judicial decisions were adverse to her or included rigorous procedural enforcement does not establish bias or partiality warranting disqualification.

target_text: As noted above, recusal under § 455(a) is required “in any proceeding in which [a judge’s] impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” thus requiring re-cusal where the judge has acted in such a way as to give the appearance of partiality to a reasonable person. A judge’s rulings and expressions of opinion generally fail to justify recusal. As the Eleventh Circuit has put it, “adverse rulings alone do not provide a party with a basis for holding that the court’s impartiality is in doubt.” Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1075, 1103 (11th Cir.2001). Of course judges hold and express opinions about the litigants and issues that they have formed during court proceedings. But as the Supreme Court succinctly stated in United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966): “The alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source ... other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.”

the court’s dismissal of all of her claims, except her medical malpractice count, against the Nezhats and the Center, and (4) the court’s imposition of monetary sanctions. Byrne appeals the district court’s imposition of monetary sanctions as well. We consider first Manov’s argument that the district court should have recused. II. Section 455(a) of the United States Code states: “Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” On July 8, 1996, one month after the court ordered Rule 11 discovery, Manov moved the district court to recuse pursuant to this statute. The court denied the motion the next day, following a hearing on various matters. Manov renewed the motion on April 23, 1998, two months after the court entered the first sanctions order. The court denied this motion as well. Both of Manov’s motions for recusal were based on the notion that the district court created an appearance of impartiality by having in its chambers a law clerk, McDevitt, who had been employed by one of the law firms representing the Nezhats and the Center in this case and in Mullen’s state court case. Manov’s second motion added another basis for recusal— the court’s rulings against Manov demonstrated that the court’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Due to this additional alleged ground for recusal, we address the motions separately. Our standard of review is whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied Manov’s

To that the court replied: “I can’t understand frankly why you don’t realize that you have forced me to look at the documents in this case, which I dislike doing in advance of trial. You have invited me, therefore, into what I regard as, from your point of view, a rather undesirable situation. I think I made that clear at the beginning. I have told you that, forced by you to look, my views are more extreme than those of the government; and I have also made you realize that if I am required to make Findings and reach Conclusions I am opening up third-party suits that will make, in view of the size of the industry, the percentage of people involved higher than in the electrical cases.” Shortly thereafter defendants filed a motion for the disqualification of Judge Wyzanski on the grounds of personal bias and prejudice. The alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.

Any adverse attitudes that Judge Wyzanski evinced toward the defendants were based on his study of the depositions and briefs which the parties had requested him to make. What he

JOHN K. OLSON, Bankruptcy Judge.
THIS CASE is before me on the Verified Motion for Recusal of the Honorable John K. Olson Pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 5004, 28 U.S.C. § 144 and § 144 (the “Recusal Motion”) [DE 299] filed November 30, 2007, by Mary Alice Gwynn (“Ms. Gwynn”), purportedly as a creditor of these chapter 7 debtors, and on Mary Alice Gwynn’s Response to the Court’s Order on Ms. Gwynn’s Purported Compliance with Practice Requirements and Supplement to Mary Alice Gwynn’s Motion for Recusal [DE 311], filed December 11, 2007 (the “Supplemental Motion,” and together with the Recusal Motion, the “Recusal Motions”).
I conducted a hearing on the Recusal Motions on December 17, 2007, and denied them on the record. An excerpted transcript of the relevant portion of that hearing was filed on May 7, 2008, as Docket Entry 322. This Order memorializes my reasons for denying the Recusal Motions.
I. Background
I inherited this case pursuant to Chief Judge Hyman’s Order Transferring Case [DE 278] entered October 30, 2007. That Order was entered after Ms. Gwynn filed her Emergency Motion to Disqualify and Request to Stay Proceedings (the “Emergency Motion”) [DE 276], filed October 29, 2007. In the Order Transferring Case, Judge Hyman correctly ruled that no basis for his disqualification had been stated but that judicial efficiency suggested that it was appropriate to transfer this case to me because a related corporate case, In re It’s All in the Style, Inc., Case No. 05-30362, had been transferred to me in August 2007.
In the Emergency Motion, Ms. Gwynn sought two distinct forms of relief. First, she sought entry of an order disqualifying Chief Judge Hyman from further presiding in this case and to transfer the case to me. Second, she sought a stay of all proceedings in this case pending determination of an appeal now pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. I conducted a hearing on the Emergency Motion on November 7, 2007, and entered an Order denying the relief sought on November 9, 2007 [DE 285], published as In re Hussey, 378 B.R. 397 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.2007). I denied the Emergency Motion as moot to the extent that it sought Judge Hyman’s disqualification and denied the balance of the Emergency Motion on the merits.
The matters giving rise to the Recusal Motions all occurred at the hearing on the Emergency Motion on November 7, 2007, and chiefly arise out of colloquy between Ms. Gwynn and me at that hearing relating to her non-compliance with the Local Rules of this Court. A transcript of that hearing is found at Docket Entry 289 and portions of it are contained in the Recusal Motion.
As I ruled in the Order denying the Emergency Motion, Ms. Gwynn’s pleadings in this case which were then before me did not bear either of the alternative certifications required under this Court’s then-applicable Local Rule 9011-4, which provided in relevant part as follows:
(A) Identification of Attorney. In the signature block of all court papers signed by an attorney, the attorney must be identified by name, state bar number, complete mailing address, telephone number and the name of the party who [sic] the attorney represents.
(B) Certification of Attorney. Papers filed by an attorney appearing:
(1) as a qualified attorney pursuant to Local Rule 2090-l(A) must contain this certification: “I hereby certify that I am admitted to the Bar of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and am in compliance with the additional qualifications to practice in this court set forth in Local Rule 2090-KA).”....
(2) pro hac vice pursuant to Local Rule 2090-l(B)(2) must contain this certification: “I hereby certify that the undersigned attorney is appearing pro hac vice in this matter pursuant to court order dated (date).” This certification shall be placed in papers in the locations described in subdivision (1) above.
In turn, Local Rule 2090-1 provides in relevant part:
Rule 2090-1. Attorneys.
(A) Qualifications to Practice. Except as provided in subdivision (B) of this rule, to be qualified to practice in this court an attorney must:
(1) be a member of the Bar of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida under the Special Rules Governing the Admission and Practice of Attorneys in the District Court;
(2) read and remain familiar with these rules, administrative orders, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, The Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct, and the Bankruptcy Code; and
(3) earn at least 12 credit hours from The Florida Bar for attending or participating in CLE courses related to the subject area of “Bankruptcy Law” during each attorney’s Florida Bar three-year CLE reporting requirement. This provision will not preclude an attorney from appearing who is within a three-year CLE reporting period but who has not yet earned the required 12 hours for that period.
Attorneys appearing pursuant to this subdivision must include on all papers the certification contained in Local Rule 9011-4CB).
(B) Appearances Permitted as Exceptions to Qualification Requirements.
An attorney who has not fulfilled the qualifications to practice set forth in subdivision (A) above may only appear as set forth in this subdivision. Any attorney who appears pursuant to this rule shall be deemed to be familiar with, and shall be governed by, these rules, and the Rules of Professional Conduct and other ethical limitations or requirements governing the professional behavior of members of The Florida Bar.
(1) Appearances in Limited Instances. [Inapplicable here].
(2) Pro Hac Vice Appearances. Any attorney who is a member in good standing of the bar of any state or territory or insular possession of the United States, but is not admitted to practice in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and qualified to practice before this court may, upon the filing and this court’s approval of the Local Form “Motion to Appear Pro Hac Vice” and proposed Local Form “Order Admitted Attorney Pro Hac Vice”, be permitted to appear and participate in a particular case or proceeding. The motion shall designate an attorney who is qualified to practice in this court and who maintains an office in this district for the practice of law with whom the court and opposing counsel may readily communicate regarding the conduct of the case or proceeding and upon whom papers shall be served. The motion must be accompanied by a written statement of the local attorney who consented to the designation, and the name, address and tele phone number of the named des-ignee. The motion shall (a) indicate all bars or courts to which the attorney is admitted; (b) indicate all bars or courts, if any, from which the visiting attorney has been disbarred, suspended or prohibited from appearing in front of and the dates of the foregoing; and (e) certify that the visiting attorney is familiar with and shall be governed by these rules, the Rules of Professional Conduct and all other requirements governing the professional behavior of members of The Florida Bar. Visiting attorneys appearing under this subdivision shall include on all papers filed with the court the certification contained in Local Rule 9011-4(B)(2). Upon written motion and for good cause shown, the court may waive or modify the requirements of designation of qualified local counsel.
In light of these requirements contained in the Local Rules, it was surprising to me that the Emergency Motion contained neither of the alternative certifications mandated by Local Rule 9011-4(A) or Local Rule 9011-4(B)(2). When I raised the absence of either certification with Ms. Gwynn, she asserted — falsely—that she was representing herself and appearing before me pro se. As noted in footnote 1 above, Ms. Gwynn individually is not a creditor of these Debtors. Proof of Claim 18-1 was filed by Gwynn, P.A., and both the proof of claim form and the underlying contract on which it is based so indicate.
Local Rule 9010 — 1(B)(1) prohibits corporations from appearing in proceedings in this Court except in limited circumstances. The Rule provides:
(1) Corporations and Other Business Entities. A corporation, partnership, trust, or other business entity cannot appear or act on its own behalf without counsel in a case or proceeding, except to file a request for service of notices (pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2002), a proof of claim, a response to an objection to its claim, or a ballot, or to attend and inquire at the meeting of creditors held under 11 U.S.C. § 341.
It is clear that the Emergency Motion did not fall within any of the exceptions to Local Rule 9010 — 1(B)(1). Thus, under the Local Rules, Gwynn, P.A. could only appear by an attorney authorized to practice in this Court under Local Rule 2090-1.
Local Rule 9010 — 1(B)(1) is completely consistent with the very long-standing rule that corporations and other artificial entities can act only through their agents, cannot appear pro se, and must be represented by counsel. Commercial & Railroad Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb, 39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 60, 10 L.Ed. 354 (1840); Osborn v. Bank of United States, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738, 6 L.Ed. 204 (1824); Palazzo v. Gulf Oil Corporation, 764 F.2d 1381, 1385-86 (11th Cir.1985); In re K.M.A., Inc., 652 F.2d 398 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981); In re Las Colinas Development Corp., 585 F.2d 7 (1st Cir.1978). There is simply no question that a corporation cannot be represented by someone who is not an authorized attorney, even if that person is the president and sole shareholder of the corporation. Palazzo, supra; Las Colinas, supra.
The question here is whether Ms. Gwynn, despite her failure to certify to her qualification to practice in this Court, is an attorney who could represent Gwynn, P.A., in this case.
I took at face value Ms. Gwynn’s statement to me at the hearing on November 7, 2007, that my questioning her ability to act in this case took her by surprise. It was for that reason that I allowed her to proceed with argument on the substance of the Motion; I did not want to prejudice any substantive rights because of a procedural failure. It was nonetheless necessary to deal with the question as to whether Ms. Gwynn could represent Gwynn, P.A. going forward.
I concluded that Ms. Gwynn could not then represent Gwynn, P.A. in this case. In a very detailed order [DE 1553] entered on June 7, 2006, in another case in this District, In re Walker, Case No. 03-32158-BKC-PGH, Chief Judge Hyman prohibited Gwynn from acting as an attorney in any case in this Court until she establishes the minimal qualifications to do so which are required by this Court’s Local Rules. Specifically, the decretal paragraphs of that Order [DE 1553] provides:
The Court, having reviewed the Response, the Sworn Certification, the docket in this case, having observed Gwynn’s conduct in this Court during the past three years, and being otherwise fully advised in the premises, hereby:
ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that Gwynn shall be prohibited from representing any parties before the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida until she earns 12 credit hours from the Florida Bar for attending or participating in CLE courses related to the subject area of “Bankruptcy Law” which shall mean courses directly related to Title 11 of the United States Code and the Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure.
At the November 7, 2007, hearing on the Emergency Motion, I asked Ms. Gwynn if she had taken any CLE courses in the area of bankruptcy law. She informed me that she had taken five hours of such courses. Manifestly, therefore, she had failed as of that date to comply with the condition precedent imposed by In re Walker that she obtain 12 CLE credit hours from The Florida Bar before she may represent any party in this Court. Thus, not only had Ms. Gwynn failed to comply with the requirements of Local Rules 2090-1 and 9011-4, but she had also failed to comply with the requirements of a valid Order of this Court which had not (and has not) been stayed or reversed on appeal. She has also acknowledged by her own representation made to me at the hearing on the Emergency Motion that she did not then satisfy the minimal practice requirements set forth in Local Rule 2090-1(A)(3). I therefore concluded that Ms. Gwynn could not represent Gwynn, P.A. until and unless she is in full compliance with the Local Rules and with the mandate of Chief Judge Hyman in In re Walker. See [DE 1553] in Walker. Given what Chief Judge Hyman found in Walker was her gross unfamiliarity “with the Court’s Local Rules, administrative orders, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, The Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct, and the Bankruptcy Code,” I prohibited Ms. Gwynn from filing any pleading or representing any party in any case in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida (other than appearances expressly permitted under Local Rule 2090 — 1(B)(1) “Appearances in Limited Instances”) until such time as she provided to me a certified record from The Florida Bar which establishes that she has completed at least 12 hours of Florida Bar approved CLE courses in the area of Bankruptcy Law.
The Recusal Motions assert that my questioning of Ms. Gwynn at the hearing on the Emergency Motion was “not only demeaning, but show a pre-disposition and/or pre-determination against her, indicating the Court cannot be fair and impartial in its rulings.” The Recusal Motions also contend that I have been selective in enforcing the Local Rules “in a discriminating fashion.”
Much of the Recusal Motion is devoted to complaints about proceedings in other courts involving the lawyers who represent the chapter 7 Trustee in this case, Deborah Menotte. Some background is in order. The Walker case referred to above has been a protracted slug-fest involving, among others, Ms. Gwynn and Gary J. Rotella, a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer who represents Trustee Menotte in this case. It is sufficient for purposes of the matters now before me to note that the animosity between Ms. Gwynn and Mr. Rotella (and his firm) is nonpareil. That animosity has overflowed into every matter in contention between these parties, and may help explain the bitterness of the pleadings and the umbrage which Ms. Gwynn took to my questioning her qualifications.
As part of the Order [DE 285] denying the Emergency Motion [DE 276], I prohibited Ms. Gwynn from filing any pleadings in this Court until she was in compliance with the Local Rules. The hearing on the Emergency Motion was held November 7, 2007, and the Order denying the Emergency Motion was entered November 9th. On November 19th, Ms. Gwynn filed a Notice of Compliance [DE 295], asserting that she was in full compliance with the Local Rules. On November 30th, Ms. Gwynn filed the Recusal Motion. On December 4, 2007, I entered an Order on Gwynn’s Purported Compliance with Practice Requirements [DE 302]. The entire text of that Order recites as follows:
This case is before me without a hearing on Mary Alice Gwynn’s Notice of Compliance (the “Notice”) [DE 295] purporting to establish that she is in compliance with the provisions of the Order [DE 285] entered in this case on November 7, 2007, which (among other things) prohibited her from acting on behalf of a corporation in this case because she is not qualified to practice in this Court. The Notice was filed on November 19, 2007.
Ms. Gwynn has now filed a verified motion (the “Motion to Disqualify”) [DE 299] seeking to disqualify me from acting further in this case. The Motion to Disqualify has been set for hearing in the ordinary course on December 17, 2007. In light of the allegations contained in the Motion to Disqualify, which assert that my impartiality might reasonably be questioned, it would be inappropriate for me to consider the Notice or to act in respect of any matters in this case until such time as I have ruled on the Motion to Disqualify. In the event that I grant the Motion to Disqualify, the Notice should of course be considered by a successor judge in this case. In the event that I deny the Motion to Disqualify, the Notice will be considered in due course.
Ms. Gwynn filed the Supplemental Motion on December 11, 2007. In it, she contends that I had “had adequate time to respond to Ms. Gwynn’s Notice prior to the filing of her Motion for Recusal,” and that “for the Court to withhold any ruling for sixteen (16) days, when the Court is well aware that not allowing Creditor, Gwynn, access to file critical, timely pleadings, could have grave impact not only on her practice, but on her personally, and is extremely prejudicial in and of itself.” The Supplemental Motion contends “[f]or the Court to delay reinstatement for any reason, and to deny Gwynn’s access to the Court to file, in violation of her constitutional rights, is further evidence of prejudgment or bias on the part of this Court, which warrants recusal.” Finally, the Supplemental Motion contends (without any citation to evidence) that I am “now working in conjunction with Judge Hyman to ruin her reputation and career, both personally and professionally.”
II. Discussion
The Recusal Motions contend that I should recuse myself from further consideration of this case pursuant to the provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 5004, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 144 and 455. 28 U.S.C. § 144 is clearly inapplicable. It provides as follows:
Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding.
The affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed not less than ten days before the beginning of the term at which the proceeding is to be heard, or good cause shall be shown for failure to file it within such time. A party may file only one such affidavit in any case, It shall be accompanied by a certificate of counsel of record stating that it is made in good faith.
Section 144 is applicable only to proceedings “in a district court,” and has no application to proceedings before a bankruptcy judge. Dubnoff v. targetstein, 385 F.2d 717, 720 (2nd Cir.1967); Ginger v. Cohn, 255 F.2d 99 (6th Cir.1958); Seidel v. Durkin (In re Goodwin), 194 B.R. 214, 221 (9th Cir. BAP 1996).
By its express terms, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 5004 makes clear that the disqualification of a bankruptcy judge is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 455. Section 455(a) speaks in general terms and requires the recusal of a federal judge, including s bankruptcy judge, “in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” thus requiring recusal not only where the judge has actual bias but also where he or she has acted in such a way as to give the appearance of partiality to a reasonable person. SCA Services, Inc. v. Morgan, 557 F.2d 110, 113-14 (7th Cir.1977). The appearance of impartiality is virtually as important as the fact of impartiality. Webbe v. McGhie Land Title Co., 549 F.2d 1358, 1361 (10th Cir.1977). It is of no consequence that the judge is not actually biased, inasmuch as § 455 concerns not only fairness to individual litigants but also the public’s confidence in the judiciary, which could be irreparably harmed if a case were allowed to proceed before a judge who appears to be tainted. In re Kensington Intern., Ltd., 353 F.3d 211 (3rd Cir.2003); on remand 305 B.R. 175 (D.Del.2004); opinion after remand 368 F.3d 289 (3rd Cir.2004).
In addition to the general requirement of impartiality contained in § 455(a), § 455(b) requires recusal in specific situations, including where the judge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts; where the judge personally or through former law partners or associates was involved in the case or has been a material witness concerning it; where the judge or a close relative is involved in the case; or where the judge, his spouse, or a minor child residing in his household has either a financial interest in the outcome or any other interest which could be substantially affected by the outcome of the case.
Although none of the specific grounds for disqualification specified in § 455(b) apply here, I think it useful to comment on this last provision, that dealing with “financial interest.” A judge is required by § 455(c) to “inform himself about his personal and fiduciary financial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself about the personal financial interests of his spouse and minor children living in his household.” A judge is thus required to recuse him-or herself whenever the judge, his or her spouse, or a minor child living at home owns a single share of stock in a litigant. Union Carbide Corp. v. U.S. Cutting Service, Inc., 782 F.2d 710 (7th Cir.1986). This requirement may seem extreme, but its fundamental wisdom is perhaps best expressed in the following poem by Benjamin Franklin, writing decades before the American Revolution in Poor Richard’s Almanack:
The Complaint
A Farmer once made a complaint to a Judge,
My Bull, if it please you, Sir, owing a Grudge,
Belike to one of your good Worship’s Cattle,
Has slain him out-right in a mortal Battle:
I’m sorry at heart because of the Action, And want to know how must be made Satisfaction.
Why, you must give me your Bull, that’s plain
Says the Judge, or pay me the Price of the Slain.
But I have mistaken the Case, Sir, says John,
The dead Bull I talk of, and please you, ‘s my own:
And yours is the Beast that the Mischief has done.
The Judge soon replies with a serious Face:
Say you so? Then this Accident alters the case.
Section 455 is designed to assure that no federal judge is ever put in a position where his or her financial interests, however minimal, could be cited as having influenced the results of litigation.

The Westinghouse Company's reliance on an informal proof of its claim is unsupported by the established legal standards. In 21 F.2d 182, it is emphasized that a valid amendment requires an original claim to have been filed within the statutory period. Without such a filing, amendment privileges do not apply, as the statute aims to prevent dilatory creditors from filing claims after the deadline. Similarly, 20 F.2d 84 reinforces that informal documentation, which substantially mirrors a formal claim, may support an amendment only if an original proof had been timely submitted.

Furthermore, the precedent set in Hutchinson v. Otis & Co., mentioned in 20 F.2d 84, reflects that bankruptcy courts exhibit liberal discretion in permitting amendments when there is an existing formal or informal basis filed initially. This flexibility, however, does not extend to situations where no foundational claim exists within the statutory period, as addressed in the case In re Schaffner, also cited in 20 F.2d 84.

In this case, since the referee did not receive the mailed proof of claim, its non-receipt fails to constitute the necessary filing requirement, per the ruling in In re R. B. Rose Co., Inc. cited in 43 F.2d 446. Therefore, despite the Westinghouse Company's arguments, the absence of a filed claim within the statutory timeframe precludes the possibility of amendment under established bankruptcy laws and supporting precedents.

target_text: Westinghouse contends that even if formal proof of its claim was not filed within the statutory period for filing claims, nevertheless the correspondence hereinbefore quoted, and the action of its attorney within such period, constituted an informal proof of its claim and a sufficient basis for granting it leave to amend and file a formal proof of claim after the expiration of the statutory period. The rule that certain acts of a creditor in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding and during the statutory period for filing proof of claim, may give rise to something equivalent to a proof of claim .and afford a sufficient basis for allowing an .amendment after the statutory period for filing, was recognized and applied in many cases decided before the 1938 amendment of the Bankruptcy Act.

ease itself, within the year fixed by the statute, to support an amendment after the expiration of the year. In Remington on Bankruptcy, vol. 2, § 747, it is said: “An amendment must be based upon an original claim, filed. And the power of permitting amendment must not be perverted to let in dilatory creditors who have failed to file any proof of claim within the statutory year limited for filing claims. # * * » Again in the same section it is said: “But, at any rate, the original proof need not be formal in order to support an amendment. Thus an agreement to accept a settlement, signed by the creditor and setting forth the amount and nature of his claim, will be sufficient to support an amendment. Again, a mere letter mentioning the claim, received by receiver and acknowledged by him to the creditor, has been held a sufficient basis.” It would seem from this authority and cases cited in the notes to section 747 that the allowance of the amendment addresses itself largely to the discretion of the court, provided there is a sufficient basis for the amendment. Again in the same authority (section 889), we find: “Of course, there must have been an original proof duly filed within the year; otherwise there would be nothing by whieh to amend; and the power of amendment is not to be distorted to let in dilatory creditors who have filed no proof within the limited year.

On September 17, 1951, the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company filed petition for review of an order of the referee in' bankruptcy entered September 7, 1951. The order appealed from denied the petition of the Westinghouse Company filed May 22, 1951, for leave to amend an alleged informal proof of its claim against the bankrupt by the filing of a formal proof, after the expiration of the six-months’ period allowed for filing claims.
On his voluntary petition Clarence R. Beattie was adjudged a bankrupt January 14, 1949, and George H. Cross was appointed and qualified as trustee of the bankrupt’s estate. The schedules listed the Westinghouse Company as an unsecured judgment creditor in the amount of $1-579.41. On February 2, 1949, attorney Harold H. Smedley of Muskegon, Michigan, who represented the Westinghouse Company, wrote the referee as follows: “Re : Clarence R. Beattie, bankrupt. Will you please advise the date of the first meeting of creditors in the above bankrupt matter?” At a hearing before the referee Smedley testified that with this letter he enclosed a proof of the claim of the Westinghouse Company. However, it appears that this proof of claim was never received by the referee. The next day, February 3d, the referee sent the usual form of notice to all creditors, including the Westinghouse Company and attorney Smedley, informing them that the first meeting of the bankrupt’s creditors would be held February 16th. This notice was never received by the Westinghouse Company, but Smedley testified that he received notice of such first meeting. However, it appears that Smedley was not present and that the Westinghouse Company was not represented at the creditors’ meeting on the 16th.
On April 14, 1949, the attorney for the trustee wrote Smedley as follows:
“I understand that you are local attorney for Westinghouse Electric Supply Company. I represent George FI. Cross, trustee of the above bankrupt (Clarence R. Beat-tie).
“The trustee is informed that on December 15, 1948, the bankrupt made a bulk sale of merchandise to Westinghouse without complying with the Bulk Sales Law. The amount involved was $242.30. The adjudication took place January 14, 1949.
“Will your client voluntarily pay the trustee $242.30 ? Are we misinformed about the transaction?”
On April 15th Smedley replied: “In reference to your letter of April 14, concerning the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company, I represented them in obtaining a judgment against Beattie on January 3, 1949, after having been endeavoring to collect $1,579.41 from them since October 22, 1948. T know of no bulk sales by Beattie to Westinghouse during that period of time. As far as I know and as far as my records disclose -you have been misinformed.”
On May 5th Smedley again wrote the attorney for the trustee: “In furtherance of your letter of April 14th concerning an alleged bulk sale to Westinghouse, there you have been misinformed. There was no such transaction. At one time, Beattie offered to return some merchandise for credit but it was refused. I have verified this with the Detroit attorneys for the Westinghouse Company.”
On September 23, 1949, Smedley wrote the trustee: “I think a further examination should be made as to where all the money went in this bankruptcy. Here is a signed statement Beattie made on January 5, 1948, in which he lists current assets at $53,150, with no liabilities. It was on this statement that the Westinghouse Electric Company sold the merchandise to this man. Will the trustee in bankruptcy do something about it?”
In reply to this last letter, the trustee wrote Smedley on September 24th as follows :
“I am in receipt of your letter of Sept. 23, enclosing statement furnished by the bankrupt to Westinghouse Electric Supply Co. under date of 1-5-48.
“A somewhat similar statement was furnished by the bankrupt to the B. F. Goodrich Company, and the matter was gone into quite fully before the referee in a hearing on the petition of the B. F. Goodrich Co. to reclaim certain merchandise alleged to have been sold in reliance upon such statement. The checks and bank deposit book of the bankrupt disclose that he did actually have on hand approximately $9,000 in cash or in the bank. The real estate which is valued in the statement at $22,500 was his home on Peck Street, the title to which stood in the joint names of himself and wife.
“If you think a further investigation should be made, I would suggest that you file a petition under the provisions of Sect. 21-a of the Bankruptcy Law.
“I am returning the statement which you enclosed.”
On July 20, 1950, Smedley wrote the referee in bankruptcy concerning the Beattie bankruptcy proceeding: “What is the present situation in the above named bankruptcy matter which occurred about a year ago? We filed a claim and never heard anything of it since. Was it closed? Was there any dividend?”
The statutory period for filing claims in the Beattie bankruptcy proceeding expired August 16, 1949. Section 57, sub. n of the Bankruptcy Act as amended, 11 U.S.C. § 93, sub. n, provides: “Except as otherwise provided in this Act, all claims provable under this Act, * * * shall be proved and filed in the manner provided in this section. Claims which are not filed within six months after the first date set for the first meeting of creditors shall not be allowed”.
On May 22, 1951, nearly two years after the expiration of the six-months’ period allowed for filing claims, the Westinghouse Company filed the following petition for leave to amend its alleged proof of claim by the filing of formal proof of claim:
“The petitioner Westinghouse Electric Supply Company, a Michigan corporation, by its attorney Harold H. Smedley, respectfully represents:
“1. That the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company is a judgment creditor of the above named bankrupt on a judgment rendered January 3, 1949 in the circuit court of the county of Muskegon in the amount of $1,579.41, with costs of $24.70.
“2. That a proof of claim of the above named creditor was on February 2, 1949 mailed to the above named referee in bankruptcy for the amount of $1,503.20, which was the amount remaining unpaid on said judgment.
“3. That said proof of claim was never filed in the bankruptcy court and hence said claim has not been allowed, although the claim does appear on the schedules filed with the bankruptcy court by the bankrupt.
“4. That your petitioner has at various times discussed this claim with the trustee and his attorney and that they have both acknowledged the validity and existence of this claim against the bankrupt estate.
“5. That the time for the filing of any new claims has expired the last date of filing being August 16, 1949, and that the claim of your petitioner as a new claim cannot now be duly filed.
“6. That your petitioner prays that an order be entered granting this petitioner the right to amend its claim so that its claim can be properly filed and allowed.”
This petition by Westinghouse to amend its claim appears to be based on the theory that even though it had not filed and proved its claim within the six-months’ period, the correspondence between its attorney and the trustee and his attorney and the referee constituted an informal proof of claim and a sufficient ground for granting leave to amend after the period for filing had expired.
In pursuance of its petition to amend, the Westinghouse Company about July S, 1951, tendered to the referee a formal proof of its claim against the bankrupt. Objections to the petition to amend and to the proposed formal claim were filed by the B. F. Goodrich Company, a creditor of the bankrupt. It appears that prior to the filing of the Westinghouse petition to amend, the trustee in bankruptcy had instituted suit in the circuit court of Muskegon county against the Goodrich Company to set aside certain transfers of property by the bankrupt, on the ground that the transfers were in violation of the so-called bulk sales law. As the amount of the trustee’s recovery in this suit against Goodrich would be limited to a total of the liabilities of the bankrupt, Goodrich as defendant in that suit had a vital interest in the Westinghouse claim, because if it were allowed, the contingent liability of Goodrich to the trustee would be increased by the amount of the claim.
In support of its petition to amend, the Westinghouse Company alleged that a formal proof of its claim was mailed by its attorney to the referee on February 2, 1949.. However, it appears from the record that this proof of claim was never received by the referee. The referee found that no formal claim was filed by the Westinghouse-Company within the statutory six-months’ period and that no informal proof of claim had been established upon which an amendment might be predicated. In its petition for review the Westinghouse Company contends that the referee erred in finding that it had not filed proof of its claim on February 2, 1949, and also erred in finding that it had not made such informal proof of claim as would entitle it to amend by filing formal proof after the expiration of the-six-months’ period.
There appears to be some dispute as to-whether, at the hearing before the referee, attorney Smedley testified that he mailed proof of the Westinghouse claim to the referee on February 2, or November 2,. 1949. However, this would seem to be immaterial, and in this opinion the court will assume that he mailed proof of claim to the referee on February 2, 1949, but that such proof was not received by the referee.
Assuming that proof of its claim was mailed to the referee within the statutory period for filing claims, that fact cannot aid the petitioner. The law is well established that the proof of claim must be- - filed within the statutory period and that merely placing a proof of claim in the mail properly addressed to the referee does not satisfy the filing requirement of section 57,. sub. n of the Bankruptcy Act. In the case of In re R. B. Rose Co., Inc., D.C., 43 F.2d 446, 447, the court said: “Section 57, sub. n * * * provides that ‘claims shall not be proved against a bankrupt estate subsequent to six months after the adjudication * * *.’ There is no statute authorizing the mailing the proof of claim or providing that mailing is sufficient. The creditor who selects-the mail as a vehicle for filing his proof of claim assumes the risk of loss or miscarriage. This is a well-known rule, and the fact that the lost paper is a proof of claim for filing with a referee in bankruptcy creates no exception.” See also In re Harris Bros., D.C., 5 F.Supp. 191.

Section 455(a) of 28 U.S.C. mandates that any justice, judge, or magistrate must disqualify themselves in any proceeding where their impartiality may reasonably be questioned. Similar principles were applied in the case referenced as 261 F.3d 1075, where motions for recusal were denied based on the argument of perceived partiality due to earlier rulings and a law clerk’s previous employment at a related law firm. This case emphasizes that impartiality must be assessed based on reasonableness and factual basis.

Moreover, the Supreme Court in 384 U.S. 563 reaffirmed the essential principle that bias and prejudice necessitating recusal must stem from an extrajudicial source, not from a judge's participation in the case or their judicial conduct therein. In my questioning of Ms. Gwynn's compliance with the Local Rules, there was no external influence or bias; rather, the actions were within judicial discretion to ensure adherence to procedural norms.

Given these precedents, none of Ms. Gwynn’s allegations meet the statutory or jurisprudential threshold for recusal under 28 U.S.C. § 455. The mere fact that judicial decisions were adverse to her or included rigorous procedural enforcement does not establish bias or partiality warranting disqualification.

target_text: As noted above, recusal under § 455(a) is required “in any proceeding in which [a judge’s] impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” thus requiring re-cusal where the judge has acted in such a way as to give the appearance of partiality to a reasonable person. A judge’s rulings and expressions of opinion generally fail to justify recusal. As the Eleventh Circuit has put it, “adverse rulings alone do not provide a party with a basis for holding that the court’s impartiality is in doubt.” Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1075, 1103 (11th Cir.2001). Of course judges hold and express opinions about the litigants and issues that they have formed during court proceedings. But as the Supreme Court succinctly stated in United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966): “The alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source ... other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.”

the court’s dismissal of all of her claims, except her medical malpractice count, against the Nezhats and the Center, and (4) the court’s imposition of monetary sanctions. Byrne appeals the district court’s imposition of monetary sanctions as well. We consider first Manov’s argument that the district court should have recused. II. Section 455(a) of the United States Code states: “Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” On July 8, 1996, one month after the court ordered Rule 11 discovery, Manov moved the district court to recuse pursuant to this statute. The court denied the motion the next day, following a hearing on various matters. Manov renewed the motion on April 23, 1998, two months after the court entered the first sanctions order. The court denied this motion as well. Both of Manov’s motions for recusal were based on the notion that the district court created an appearance of impartiality by having in its chambers a law clerk, McDevitt, who had been employed by one of the law firms representing the Nezhats and the Center in this case and in Mullen’s state court case. Manov’s second motion added another basis for recusal— the court’s rulings against Manov demonstrated that the court’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Due to this additional alleged ground for recusal, we address the motions separately. Our standard of review is whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied Manov’s

To that the court replied: “I can’t understand frankly why you don’t realize that you have forced me to look at the documents in this case, which I dislike doing in advance of trial. You have invited me, therefore, into what I regard as, from your point of view, a rather undesirable situation. I think I made that clear at the beginning. I have told you that, forced by you to look, my views are more extreme than those of the government; and I have also made you realize that if I am required to make Findings and reach Conclusions I am opening up third-party suits that will make, in view of the size of the industry, the percentage of people involved higher than in the electrical cases.” Shortly thereafter defendants filed a motion for the disqualification of Judge Wyzanski on the grounds of personal bias and prejudice. The alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case. Berger v. United States, 255 U. S. 22, 31. Any adverse attitudes that Judge Wyzanski evinced toward the defendants were based on his study of the depositions and briefs which the parties had requested him to make. What he

previous_text: ORDER DENYING MARY ALICE GWYNN’S MOTION TO RECUSE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE
JOHN K. OLSON, Bankruptcy Judge.
THIS CASE is before me on the Verified Motion for Recusal of the Honorable John K. Olson Pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 5004, 28 U.S.C. § 144 and § 144 (the “Recusal Motion”) [DE 299] filed November 30, 2007, by Mary Alice Gwynn (“Ms. Gwynn”), purportedly as a creditor of these chapter 7 debtors, and on Mary Alice Gwynn’s Response to the Court’s Order on Ms. Gwynn’s Purported Compliance with Practice Requirements and Supplement to Mary Alice Gwynn’s Motion for Recusal [DE 311], filed December 11, 2007 (the “Supplemental Motion,” and together with the Recusal Motion, the “Recusal Motions”).
I conducted a hearing on the Recusal Motions on December 17, 2007, and denied them on the record. An excerpted transcript of the relevant portion of that hearing was filed on May 7, 2008, as Docket Entry 322. This Order memorializes my reasons for denying the Recusal Motions.
I. Background
I inherited this case pursuant to Chief Judge Hyman’s Order Transferring Case [DE 278] entered October 30, 2007. That Order was entered after Ms. Gwynn filed her Emergency Motion to Disqualify and Request to Stay Proceedings (the “Emergency Motion”) [DE 276], filed October 29, 2007. In the Order Transferring Case, Judge Hyman correctly ruled that no basis for his disqualification had been stated but that judicial efficiency suggested that it was appropriate to transfer this case to me because a related corporate case, In re It’s All in the Style, Inc., Case No. 05-30362, had been transferred to me in August 2007.
In the Emergency Motion, Ms. Gwynn sought two distinct forms of relief. First, she sought entry of an order disqualifying Chief Judge Hyman from further presiding in this case and to transfer the case to me. Second, she sought a stay of all proceedings in this case pending determination of an appeal now pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. I conducted a hearing on the Emergency Motion on November 7, 2007, and entered an Order denying the relief sought on November 9, 2007 [DE 285], published as In re Hussey, 378 B.R. 397 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.2007). I denied the Emergency Motion as moot to the extent that it sought Judge Hyman’s disqualification and denied the balance of the Emergency Motion on the merits.
The matters giving rise to the Recusal Motions all occurred at the hearing on the Emergency Motion on November 7, 2007, and chiefly arise out of colloquy between Ms. Gwynn and me at that hearing relating to her non-compliance with the Local Rules of this Court. A transcript of that hearing is found at Docket Entry 289 and portions of it are contained in the Recusal Motion.
As I ruled in the Order denying the Emergency Motion, Ms. Gwynn’s pleadings in this case which were then before me did not bear either of the alternative certifications required under this Court’s then-applicable Local Rule 9011-4, which provided in relevant part as follows:
(A) Identification of Attorney. In the signature block of all court papers signed by an attorney, the attorney must be identified by name, state bar number, complete mailing address, telephone number and the name of the party who [sic] the attorney represents.
(B) Certification of Attorney. Papers filed by an attorney appearing:
(1) as a qualified attorney pursuant to Local Rule 2090-l(A) must contain this certification: “I hereby certify that I am admitted to the Bar of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and am in compliance with the additional qualifications to practice in this court set forth in Local Rule 2090-KA).”....
(2) pro hac vice pursuant to Local Rule 2090-l(B)(2) must contain this certification: “I hereby certify that the undersigned attorney is appearing pro hac vice in this matter pursuant to court order dated (date).” This certification shall be placed in papers in the locations described in subdivision (1) above.
In turn, Local Rule 2090-1 provides in relevant part:
Rule 2090-1. Attorneys.
(A) Qualifications to Practice. Except as provided in subdivision (B) of this rule, to be qualified to practice in this court an attorney must:
(1) be a member of the Bar of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida under the Special Rules Governing the Admission and Practice of Attorneys in the District Court;
(2) read and remain familiar with these rules, administrative orders, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, The Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct, and the Bankruptcy Code; and
(3) earn at least 12 credit hours from The Florida Bar for attending or participating in CLE courses related to the subject area of “Bankruptcy Law” during each attorney’s Florida Bar three-year CLE reporting requirement. This provision will not preclude an attorney from appearing who is within a three-year CLE reporting period but who has not yet earned the required 12 hours for that period.
Attorneys appearing pursuant to this subdivision must include on all papers the certification contained in Local Rule 9011-4CB).
(B) Appearances Permitted as Exceptions to Qualification Requirements.
An attorney who has not fulfilled the qualifications to practice set forth in subdivision (A) above may only appear as set forth in this subdivision. Any attorney who appears pursuant to this rule shall be deemed to be familiar with, and shall be governed by, these rules, and the Rules of Professional Conduct and other ethical limitations or requirements governing the professional behavior of members of The Florida Bar.
(1) Appearances in Limited Instances. [Inapplicable here].
(2) Pro Hac Vice Appearances. Any attorney who is a member in good standing of the bar of any state or territory or insular possession of the United States, but is not admitted to practice in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and qualified to practice before this court may, upon the filing and this court’s approval of the Local Form “Motion to Appear Pro Hac Vice” and proposed Local Form “Order Admitted Attorney Pro Hac Vice”, be permitted to appear and participate in a particular case or proceeding. The motion shall designate an attorney who is qualified to practice in this court and who maintains an office in this district for the practice of law with whom the court and opposing counsel may readily communicate regarding the conduct of the case or proceeding and upon whom papers shall be served. The motion must be accompanied by a written statement of the local attorney who consented to the designation, and the name, address and tele phone number of the named des-ignee. The motion shall (a) indicate all bars or courts to which the attorney is admitted; (b) indicate all bars or courts, if any, from which the visiting attorney has been disbarred, suspended or prohibited from appearing in front of and the dates of the foregoing; and (e) certify that the visiting attorney is familiar with and shall be governed by these rules, the Rules of Professional Conduct and all other requirements governing the professional behavior of members of The Florida Bar. Visiting attorneys appearing under this subdivision shall include on all papers filed with the court the certification contained in Local Rule 9011-4(B)(2). Upon written motion and for good cause shown, the court may waive or modify the requirements of designation of qualified local counsel.
In light of these requirements contained in the Local Rules, it was surprising to me that the Emergency Motion contained neither of the alternative certifications mandated by Local Rule 9011-4(A) or Local Rule 9011-4(B)(2). When I raised the absence of either certification with Ms. Gwynn, she asserted — falsely—that she was representing herself and appearing before me pro se. As noted in footnote 1 above, Ms. Gwynn individually is not a creditor of these Debtors. Proof of Claim 18-1 was filed by Gwynn, P.A., and both the proof of claim form and the underlying contract on which it is based so indicate.
Local Rule 9010 — 1(B)(1) prohibits corporations from appearing in proceedings in this Court except in limited circumstances. The Rule provides:
(1) Corporations and Other Business Entities. A corporation, partnership, trust, or other business entity cannot appear or act on its own behalf without counsel in a case or proceeding, except to file a request for service of notices (pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2002), a proof of claim, a response to an objection to its claim, or a ballot, or to attend and inquire at the meeting of creditors held under 11 U.S.C. § 341.
It is clear that the Emergency Motion did not fall within any of the exceptions to Local Rule 9010 — 1(B)(1). Thus, under the Local Rules, Gwynn, P.A. could only appear by an attorney authorized to practice in this Court under Local Rule 2090-1.
Local Rule 9010 — 1(B)(1) is completely consistent with the very long-standing rule that corporations and other artificial entities can act only through their agents, cannot appear pro se, and must be represented by counsel. Commercial & Railroad Bank of Vicksburg v. Slocomb, 39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 60, 10 L.Ed. 354 (1840); Osborn v. Bank of United States, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738, 6 L.Ed. 204 (1824); Palazzo v. Gulf Oil Corporation, 764 F.2d 1381, 1385-86 (11th Cir.1985); In re K.M.A., Inc., 652 F.2d 398 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981); In re Las Colinas Development Corp., 585 F.2d 7 (1st Cir.1978). There is simply no question that a corporation cannot be represented by someone who is not an authorized attorney, even if that person is the president and sole shareholder of the corporation. Palazzo, supra; Las Colinas, supra.
The question here is whether Ms. Gwynn, despite her failure to certify to her qualification to practice in this Court, is an attorney who could represent Gwynn, P.A., in this case.
I took at face value Ms. Gwynn’s statement to me at the hearing on November 7, 2007, that my questioning her ability to act in this case took her by surprise. It was for that reason that I allowed her to proceed with argument on the substance of the Motion; I did not want to prejudice any substantive rights because of a procedural failure. It was nonetheless necessary to deal with the question as to whether Ms. Gwynn could represent Gwynn, P.A. going forward.
I concluded that Ms. Gwynn could not then represent Gwynn, P.A. in this case. In a very detailed order [DE 1553] entered on June 7, 2006, in another case in this District, In re Walker, Case No. 03-32158-BKC-PGH, Chief Judge Hyman prohibited Gwynn from acting as an attorney in any case in this Court until she establishes the minimal qualifications to do so which are required by this Court’s Local Rules. Specifically, the decretal paragraphs of that Order [DE 1553] provides:
The Court, having reviewed the Response, the Sworn Certification, the docket in this case, having observed Gwynn’s conduct in this Court during the past three years, and being otherwise fully advised in the premises, hereby:
ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that Gwynn shall be prohibited from representing any parties before the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida until she earns 12 credit hours from the Florida Bar for attending or participating in CLE courses related to the subject area of “Bankruptcy Law” which shall mean courses directly related to Title 11 of the United States Code and the Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure.
At the November 7, 2007, hearing on the Emergency Motion, I asked Ms. Gwynn if she had taken any CLE courses in the area of bankruptcy law. She informed me that she had taken five hours of such courses. Manifestly, therefore, she had failed as of that date to comply with the condition precedent imposed by In re Walker that she obtain 12 CLE credit hours from The Florida Bar before she may represent any party in this Court. Thus, not only had Ms. Gwynn failed to comply with the requirements of Local Rules 2090-1 and 9011-4, but she had also failed to comply with the requirements of a valid Order of this Court which had not (and has not) been stayed or reversed on appeal. She has also acknowledged by her own representation made to me at the hearing on the Emergency Motion that she did not then satisfy the minimal practice requirements set forth in Local Rule 2090-1(A)(3). I therefore concluded that Ms. Gwynn could not represent Gwynn, P.A. until and unless she is in full compliance with the Local Rules and with the mandate of Chief Judge Hyman in In re Walker. See [DE 1553] in Walker. Given what Chief Judge Hyman found in Walker was her gross unfamiliarity “with the Court’s Local Rules, administrative orders, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, The Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct, and the Bankruptcy Code,” I prohibited Ms. Gwynn from filing any pleading or representing any party in any case in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida (other than appearances expressly permitted under Local Rule 2090 — 1(B)(1) “Appearances in Limited Instances”) until such time as she provided to me a certified record from The Florida Bar which establishes that she has completed at least 12 hours of Florida Bar approved CLE courses in the area of Bankruptcy Law.
The Recusal Motions assert that my questioning of Ms. Gwynn at the hearing on the Emergency Motion was “not only demeaning, but show a pre-disposition and/or pre-determination against her, indicating the Court cannot be fair and impartial in its rulings.” The Recusal Motions also contend that I have been selective in enforcing the Local Rules “in a discriminating fashion.”
Much of the Recusal Motion is devoted to complaints about proceedings in other courts involving the lawyers who represent the chapter 7 Trustee in this case, Deborah Menotte. Some background is in order. The Walker case referred to above has been a protracted slug-fest involving, among others, Ms. Gwynn and Gary J. Rotella, a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer who represents Trustee Menotte in this case. It is sufficient for purposes of the matters now before me to note that the animosity between Ms. Gwynn and Mr. Rotella (and his firm) is nonpareil. That animosity has overflowed into every matter in contention between these parties, and may help explain the bitterness of the pleadings and the umbrage which Ms. Gwynn took to my questioning her qualifications.
As part of the Order [DE 285] denying the Emergency Motion [DE 276], I prohibited Ms. Gwynn from filing any pleadings in this Court until she was in compliance with the Local Rules. The hearing on the Emergency Motion was held November 7, 2007, and the Order denying the Emergency Motion was entered November 9th. On November 19th, Ms. Gwynn filed a Notice of Compliance [DE 295], asserting that she was in full compliance with the Local Rules. On November 30th, Ms. Gwynn filed the Recusal Motion. On December 4, 2007, I entered an Order on Gwynn’s Purported Compliance with Practice Requirements [DE 302]. The entire text of that Order recites as follows:
This case is before me without a hearing on Mary Alice Gwynn’s Notice of Compliance (the “Notice”) [DE 295] purporting to establish that she is in compliance with the provisions of the Order [DE 285] entered in this case on November 7, 2007, which (among other things) prohibited her from acting on behalf of a corporation in this case because she is not qualified to practice in this Court. The Notice was filed on November 19, 2007.
Ms. Gwynn has now filed a verified motion (the “Motion to Disqualify”) [DE 299] seeking to disqualify me from acting further in this case. The Motion to Disqualify has been set for hearing in the ordinary course on December 17, 2007. In light of the allegations contained in the Motion to Disqualify, which assert that my impartiality might reasonably be questioned, it would be inappropriate for me to consider the Notice or to act in respect of any matters in this case until such time as I have ruled on the Motion to Disqualify. In the event that I grant the Motion to Disqualify, the Notice should of course be considered by a successor judge in this case. In the event that I deny the Motion to Disqualify, the Notice will be considered in due course.
Ms. Gwynn filed the Supplemental Motion on December 11, 2007. In it, she contends that I had “had adequate time to respond to Ms. Gwynn’s Notice prior to the filing of her Motion for Recusal,” and that “for the Court to withhold any ruling for sixteen (16) days, when the Court is well aware that not allowing Creditor, Gwynn, access to file critical, timely pleadings, could have grave impact not only on her practice, but on her personally, and is extremely prejudicial in and of itself.” The Supplemental Motion contends “[f]or the Court to delay reinstatement for any reason, and to deny Gwynn’s access to the Court to file, in violation of her constitutional rights, is further evidence of prejudgment or bias on the part of this Court, which warrants recusal.” Finally, the Supplemental Motion contends (without any citation to evidence) that I am “now working in conjunction with Judge Hyman to ruin her reputation and career, both personally and professionally.”
II. Discussion
The Recusal Motions contend that I should recuse myself from further consideration of this case pursuant to the provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 5004, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 144 and 455. 28 U.S.C. § 144 is clearly inapplicable. It provides as follows:
Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding.
The affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed not less than ten days before the beginning of the term at which the proceeding is to be heard, or good cause shall be shown for failure to file it within such time. A party may file only one such affidavit in any case, It shall be accompanied by a certificate of counsel of record stating that it is made in good faith.
Section 144 is applicable only to proceedings “in a district court,” and has no application to proceedings before a bankruptcy judge. Dubnoff v. targetstein, 385 F.2d 717, 720 (2nd Cir.1967); Ginger v. Cohn, 255 F.2d 99 (6th Cir.1958); Seidel v. Durkin (In re Goodwin), 194 B.R. 214, 221 (9th Cir. BAP 1996).
By its express terms, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 5004 makes clear that the disqualification of a bankruptcy judge is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 455. Section 455(a) speaks in general terms and requires the recusal of a federal judge, including s bankruptcy judge, “in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” thus requiring recusal not only where the judge has actual bias but also where he or she has acted in such a way as to give the appearance of partiality to a reasonable person. SCA Services, Inc. v. Morgan, 557 F.2d 110, 113-14 (7th Cir.1977). The appearance of impartiality is virtually as important as the fact of impartiality. Webbe v. McGhie Land Title Co., 549 F.2d 1358, 1361 (10th Cir.1977). It is of no consequence that the judge is not actually biased, inasmuch as § 455 concerns not only fairness to individual litigants but also the public’s confidence in the judiciary, which could be irreparably harmed if a case were allowed to proceed before a judge who appears to be tainted. In re Kensington Intern., Ltd., 353 F.3d 211 (3rd Cir.2003); on remand 305 B.R. 175 (D.Del.2004); opinion after remand 368 F.3d 289 (3rd Cir.2004).
In addition to the general requirement of impartiality contained in § 455(a), § 455(b) requires recusal in specific situations, including where the judge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts; where the judge personally or through former law partners or associates was involved in the case or has been a material witness concerning it; where the judge or a close relative is involved in the case; or where the judge, his spouse, or a minor child residing in his household has either a financial interest in the outcome or any other interest which could be substantially affected by the outcome of the case.
Although none of the specific grounds for disqualification specified in § 455(b) apply here, I think it useful to comment on this last provision, that dealing with “financial interest.” A judge is required by § 455(c) to “inform himself about his personal and fiduciary financial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself about the personal financial interests of his spouse and minor children living in his household.” A judge is thus required to recuse him-or herself whenever the judge, his or her spouse, or a minor child living at home owns a single share of stock in a litigant. Union Carbide Corp. v. U.S. Cutting Service, Inc., 782 F.2d 710 (7th Cir.1986). This requirement may seem extreme, but its fundamental wisdom is perhaps best expressed in the following poem by Benjamin Franklin, writing decades before the American Revolution in Poor Richard’s Almanack:
The Complaint
A Farmer once made a complaint to a Judge,
My Bull, if it please you, Sir, owing a Grudge,
Belike to one of your good Worship’s Cattle,
Has slain him out-right in a mortal Battle:
I’m sorry at heart because of the Action, And want to know how must be made Satisfaction.
Why, you must give me your Bull, that’s plain
Says the Judge, or pay me the Price of the Slain.
But I have mistaken the Case, Sir, says John,
The dead Bull I talk of, and please you, ‘s my own:
And yours is the Beast that the Mischief has done.
The Judge soon replies with a serious Face:
Say you so? Then this Accident alters the case.
Section 455 is designed to assure that no federal judge is ever put in a position where his or her financial interests, however minimal, could be cited as having influenced the results of litigation.

The trial court’s instruction on abandonment essentially followed the principles outlined in Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Co., 308 F.2d 403, which highlighted that a trademark owner’s failure to exercise control and supervision over the licensee’s use of the mark might lead to estoppel. However, in this context, it focuses on whether Sweetheart's inaction towards other infringers like Formfit and Douglas Stephens led to an implied abandonment of their rights.

Acts that are generally sufficient to establish abandonment—as noted in Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States and subsequent cases like Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., 179 U.S. 19—can be negated by explaining an actual intent not to relinquish the rights. This is further supported by 486 F.2d 114, where the lack of control and supervision over an extended period may preclude the trademark owner from later contesting usage. Given Sweetheart’s proactive measures against several infringers were documented, the nuanced application of these principles indicates that the trial court may have erred in its wholesale application of abandonment.

In summary, evidence relating to Sweetheart's actions towards other infringers should have been carefully weighed to discern between mere delay and genuine abandonment of trademark rights. The misstep in the jury instruction and subsequent handling of the abandonment defense forms a basis for reversal and remand for a retrial.

target_text: On the other hand, two of the cases relied on by Detroit, Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Company, 308 F.2d 403 (5th Cir.1962); Sheila’s Shine Products, Inc. v. Sheila Shine, Inc., 486 F.2d 114 (5th Cir.1973) are of no help in determining this issue. Those cases merely recognize the rule that a trademark owner’s uncontrolled or “naked” licensing of a mark may result in the trademark ceasing to function as a symbol of quality and controlled origin, which has been characterized as abandonment. This rule of uncontrolled licensing of a trademark is inapplicable to the instant case as no evidence of licensing has been presented. The other case relied on by Detroit, Saxlehner v. Eisener & Mendelson Co., 179 U.S. 19, 21 S.Ct. 7, 45 L.Ed. 60 (1900) does note the remedial actions taken by a trademark owner against other infringers in its discussion of abandonment; however, Saxlehner is factually distinguishable from the instant case because in Saxlehner the plaintiff’s mark “Hunyadi” was found to have become the generic name in this country for a type of water after others had used the name for twenty years without being sued by the plaintiff.

reference_case_1: 308 F.2d 403

to buy the ticking, innerspring units and labels from sources specified by Spring-Air. In Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, supra, this was said: “For our purposes a tying agreement may be defined as an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on condition that the buyer also purchase a different (or tied) product, or at least agree that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier.” Here, there was no agreement by Spring-Air to sell any of the items involved, nor was there any condition requiring Denison to also purchase a different product from Spring-Air. Instead, the agreement specified sources other than Spring-Air from which Denison should purchase specified materials as a means whereby Spring-Air could control the nature and quality of its own product under its own trademark. The trademark would be of no worth unless the public could be sure that every mattress which bore that mark was uniform both in exterior design and interior quality. Denison must accept the judgment of Spring-Air on this requirement. The record shows that Denison could and did purchase from competitive suppliers all of the innerspring units it desired for use in its private brand products of which its annual volume ranged between one million and three million dollars. It is doubtful that every “tie-in” device is unlawful. Dehydrating Process Co. v. Smith, supra, 292 F.2d 653. We find nothing in the record which requires us to disagree with the findings and conclusions of the

but also a concurrent duty to exercise control and supervision over the licensee’s use of the mark. Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Co., 5 Cir. 1962, 308 F.2d 403, 409. Cf. Kidd v. Johnson, 1879, 100 U.S. 617, 25 L.Ed. 769. Failure to exercise such control and supervision for a significant period of time may estop the trademark owner from challenging the use of the mark and business which the licensee has developed during the period of such unsupervised use. Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Co., supra. This principle is an analogue to the es-toppel against a trademark owner who knowingly sits silently by while infring-ers use his trademark over a significant period of time. Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., 1900, 179 U.S. 19, 21 S. Ct. 7, 45 L.Ed. 60; Dwinell-Wright Co. v. White House Milk Co., 2 Cir. 1943, 132 F.2d 822. The undisputed failure by the MeCaffertys to exercise any supervision or control over the activities of Pan American or its successor SS Florida leads us to hold that SS California is estopped to challenge the business which SS Florida has built up under the mark Sheila Shine. As we develop, infra, however, this estoppel precludes challenge only in the trade area awarded to SS Florida. The lower court also found that the MeCaffertys abandoned any established business in Sheila Shine polish outside the states of California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Hawaii Shortly after the January, 1955 transaction. SS California correctly contends that mere

an actual intent to abandon. Acts which unexplained would .be sufficient to establish an abandonment may be answered by showing that there never was an intention to give up and relinquish the right claimed. Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Mfg. Co., 163 U. S. 169, 186; Moore v. Stevenson, 27 Conn. 13; Livermore v. White, 74 Maine, 452; Judson v. Malloy, 40 California, 299; Hickman v. Link, 116 Missouri, 123. And in a recent English case this doctrine has been applied to a case of trade-marks. Mouson v. Boehm, 26 Ch. Div. 398. With regard to the defence of abandonment, it may with confidence be said that there is but very slight evidence of any personal intention on the part of Andreas Saxlehner or his wife to abandon the use of the word “ Hunyadi or dedicate the same to the public, and none at all of an intent to abandon the peculiar bottles and labels in connection with which he sold his waters. In fact, Saxlehner’s whole life was a constant protest against the use by others of the name “ Hunyadi.” He discovered his spring in 1862, and in 1863 obtained permission to give it the name, of Hunyadi Spring. He carried on an uninterrupted trade under that name until 1872. It also appears from the certificate of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that the trade-mark “Hunyadi Janos” was, on December 12, 1872, registered, and that previously to such registration no trade-mark was entered in which the

In this action for injunctive relief for false designation of origin under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) and unfajr competition, plaintiff Sweetheart Plastics, Inc. (Sweetheart) appeals from the judgment entered on the jury verdict in favor 0f defendant Detroit Forming, Inc. (Detroit). Sweetheart claims the district court erred in: (1) denying Sweetheart’s motion to amend its complaint; (2) refusing ac*m^ evidence of actions taken by Sweetheart against other manufacturers of substantially similar designs, and then charging the jury ^ to consider whether Sweetheart, by taking no action against °tber manufacturers, acquiesced in the manufacture of the dishes by others or abandoned its rights; (3) admitting evidence of the existence of other manufacturers of similar designs; (4) charging the jury that evidence of Sweetheart’s delay in taking action against other infringers could be considered relevant to Detroit’s defenses of estoppel by acquiescence and abandonment; (5) submitting Detroit’s defenses to the jury; and (6) refusing to grant a continuance of the trial. Finding that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to permit Sweetheart to amend its complaint under the circumstances; erred ¡n charging the jury that the evidence of Sweetheart’s failure to control other manufacturers could be considered relative to Detroit’s defenses of estoppel by acquiesCence and abandonment; and erroneously submitted the defense of abandonment to the jury, we reverse and remand.
I
This action concerns a series of four disposable plastic ice cream dishes which have been marketed by Sweetheart for the past twenty-five years. Two are rowboat-shaped dishes for banana splits, and two are bowl-shaped dishes for sundaes. Sweetheart does not have a registered trademark on the dish designs, but does own a registered trademark on the mark “Banana Boat.” Sweetheart alleged in its complaint that by virtue of its having sold billions of the dishes, and spent considerable sums Advertising and promoting them, the designs have come to identify its products as originating from a single source, Sweetheart.
During the 1960’s a company called Van Brode Milling Company (Van Brode) marketed a boat-shaped plastic ice cream dish. This practice was discontinued when Sweetheart asked Van Brode to stop. More recently, three other companies marketed lines of plastic disposable ice cream dishes which were substantially similar in design to Sweetheart’s line. These companies are Formfit Plastics, Inc. (Formfit), Douglas Stephens Plastics, Inc. (Douglas Stephens), and defendant Detroit. In addition to the instant litigation, Sweetheart has filed a companion case in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Douglas Stephens.
On July 19, 1983, six days before trial commenced, Sweetheart received certain documents it had requested from Detroit on January 28, 1983. Although the documents were ones in which Detroit had claimed that trade secrets were contained, a stipulated protective order had been entered by the court on June 9, 1983 which provided that confidential documents filed with the court would be sealed and segregated in the court’s files. One of the documents received by Sweetheart on July 19, 1983 was an invoice on which Detroit had described certain of its dishes as “Banana Boat Trays.” On the first day of trial Sweetheart moved to amend its complaint to include a count for trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1). Detroit opposed the motion as untimely. The district court denied the motion, stating: “I deny your motion, plaintiff’s motion, comes too late. If that’s all the proof you’ve got, you should have had it before then.”
Trial began on July 25, 1983. During cross-examination of one of Sweetheart’s witnesses, counsel for Detroit was permitted to inquire, over Sweetheart’s objection, as to Sweetheart’s knowledge of the use by Van Brode of a design alleged by Detroit to be similar to one of the designs in question. Also over Sweetheart’s objection, Detroit was permitted to publish deposition testimony of Stewart M. Graff, president of Douglas Stephens, and Norman Thrope, president of Formfit, which showed the use by both companies of dishes similar in design to the dishes manufactured by Sweetheart.
The district court then permitted counsel for Sweetheart, by way of cross-examination, to publish other portions of the same depositions which revealed acts taken by Sweetheart against the two companies. Specifically, the portion of the Thrope deposition published by Sweetheart showed that Sweetheart had notified Formfit that it was unhappy with Formfit’s shipping of boat-shaped dishes, and considered Formfit’s acts to be infringements on Sweetheart’s trademark rights. The portion of the Graff deposition published by Sweetheart showed that Sweetheart asked Douglas Stephens to cease manufacturing rowboat-shaped dishes and subsequently brought suit in New Jersey against Douglas Stephens for manufacturing the products.
Later in Sweetheart’s rebuttal case, the trial court permitted Sweetheart’s president to testify that Sweetheart had complained to Van Brode about the boat- shaped dish it produced, and that Van Brode thereafter stopped producing it. However, the trial judge prohibited Sweetheart from introducing in its rebuttal case evidence of the remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against Douglas Stephens and Formfit because there had been no formal adjudications in those actions.
Subsequently, the court instructed the jury to consider remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against the other manufacturers in determining whether Sweetheart acquiesced in the manufacture of similar dishes by others or abandoned its rights in the designs in question. These comments were reiterated when the district court, at the jury’s request, recharged the jury as to Detroit’s defenses.
II
The initial question to be decided is whether the district court erred in denying Sweetheart’s motion to amend its complaint. Detroit asserts Sweetheart could have included the count for trademark infringement in its complaint as originally filed, or moved to amend its complaint earlier because the words “Banana Boat” had previously appeared in certain documents which Detroit produced at the time it filed its answer and counterclaim. Detroit further contends it would have been unduly prejudiced if Sweetheart had been permitted to add a count for trademark infringement on the first day of trial.
Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that leave to amend a pleading “shall be freely given when justice so requires.” The United States Supreme Court has admonished that “this mandate is to be heeded.” Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). In Foman v. Davis, the Court stated further,
If the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits. In the absence of any apparent or declared reason — such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. — the leave sought should, as the rules require, be “freely given.” Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the District Court, but outright refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the Federal Rules.
Id. at 182, 83 S.Ct. at 230.
No apparent or declared reason for denial of the motion to amend exists in the instant case. Detroit’s assertion that Sweetheart should have included a count for trademark infringement in its complaint as originally filed is without merit. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as it existed at the time Sweetheart’s complaint was filed on January 28, 1983 provided in pertinent part:
Every pleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual name, whose address shall be stated ... The signature of an attorney constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay.
Clearly, Sweetheart’s counsel could not in good faith have included in his complaint a count for trademark infringement before he was aware of evidence to support such a claim. Such conduct would have violated both the letter and the spirit of Rule 11.
Detroit also asserts that Sweetheart could have moved to amend its complaint earlier because the mark “Banana Boat” appeared on certain documents submitted previously by Detroit. Detroit fails to cite to any evidence in the record which supports this contention. Our review of the record reveals only two documents, a blueprint drawing clearly designed for internal use by Detroit containing the words “Banana Boat Tray,” and a letter to the secretary of Detroit from a distributor in which the distributor referred to Detroit’s dishes as large and small “Banana Boat[s].” There was no evidence that this distributor ever used the term “Banana Boat” in the promotion or sale of Detroit’s dishes. Rather, the evidence shows that soon after receipt of the letter Detroit’s secretary admonished the distributor not to use the name “Banana Boat” with reference to Detroit’s products, and that this instruction was heeded. Certainly, Sweetheart’s knowledge of these documents was insufficient evidence upon which to base a claim for infringement of its trademark in connection with the sale and distribution of the dishes in interstate commerce. “Good ground” to support the claim under Rule 11 only came later, when Detroit produced an invoice containing the words “Banana Boat Trays” less than a week prior to trial.
Finally, the mere fact that the motion to amend was made the day of trial did not unduly prejudice Detroit so as to require denial of the motion. Absent prejudice to the opposing party, the mere fact that an amendment is offered late in the case is not enough to bar it. 3 J. Moore, Moore’s Federal Practice § 15.08[4] (2d ed. 1984); Howey v. United States, 481 F.2d 1187 (9th Cir.1973); Hanson v. Hunt Oil Company, 398 F.2d 578 (8th Cir.1968). The district court made no finding of prejudice to Detroit, concluding only that “plaintiff’s motion comes too late.”
Moreover, the record fails to show any basis for finding that the proffered amendment would have unduly prejudiced Detroit under the circumstances. Sweetheart’s original two counts for false designation of origin and unfair competition arise out of the sale and distribution by Detroit of plastic dishes having configurations which Sweetheart asserts are proprietary to it, including two boat-shaped dishes. The count for trademark infringement in connection with the sale and distribution of these dishes which Sweetheart sought to add by amendment is grounded on at least one of the same acts by Detroit that form the basis of the original two counts. Thus, Detroit has been aware since the filing of Sweetheart’s complaint of the circumstances from which the trademark infringement count arose. Moreover, Detroit was in possession of the document which forms the basis of Sweetheart’s motion to amend until six days before the motion was made, and thus cannot be heard to complain of unfair surprise by the inclusion of the additional count. Under these circumstances, Detroit would not have suffered undue prejudice from the amendment of the complaint immediately prior to trial. Since Sweetheart could not have brought a claim for trademark infringement earlier because Detroit did not produce the evidence of infringement until a few days before trial, and since Detroit would not have been unduly prejudiced by the amendment, the district court’s refusal to permit Sweetheart to amend its complaint was an abuse of discretion.
Ill
In addition, Sweetheart argues that the district court committed prejudicial error by refusing to admit evidence of remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against other manufacturers, and then instructing the jury to consider whether Sweetheart, by taking no action against the third party manufacturers, acquiesced in the manufacture of its dish designs by others or abandoned its rights. Sweetheart admits that it was permitted to read into the record part of the Thrope deposition which established that Sweetheart had notified Formfit that it considered the marketing of boat-shaped dishes by Formfit as an infringement of Sweetheart’s rights. However, Sweetheart asserts that all of its other efforts to introduce evidence of actions it took against the other manufacturers of boat-shaped dishes, Douglas Stephens and Van Brode, were “firmly and emphatically denied by the trial court.” This contention is utterly without support in the record. The record reveals the trial court also permitted Sweetheart to publish the part of the Graff deposition showing remedial acts Sweetheart had taken against Douglas Stephens, and to introduce rebuttal evidence of remedial acts taken by Sweetheart against Van Brode. Thus, even if the trial court erred in refusing to permit Sweetheart to admit in its rebuttal case evidence of the remedial acts it took against Douglas Stephens and Formfit, such error was harmless because the evidence had previously been published to the jury by Sweetheart. However, upon retrial the district court should allow Sweetheart full opportunity to prove all remedial actions taken against other manufacturers.
IV
We also reject Sweetheart’s argument that the trial court’s admission of Detroit’s evidence of the existence of other manufacturers of similarly designed dishes constituted prejudicial error. Evidence of the existence of manufacturers other than the defendant has certain relevance in this false designation of origin and unfair competition case. For example, with reference to a determination of whether Sweetheart had any proprietary rights in the unregistered designs of its dishes, evidence of the use of substantially identical designs by others was admissible as to the issue of whether secondary meaning attached to Sweetheart’s designs. Such evidence is probative of the extent and nature of exclusivity of use by Sweetheart. See Carter Wallace, Inc. v. Proctor & Gamble Co., 434 F.2d 794, 802 (9th Cir.1970); Universal City Studios v. Nintendo Co., 578 F.Supp. 911, 926 (S.D.N.Y.1983); Miller Brewing Co. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 503 F.Supp. 896 (D.C.Rhode Island 1980). Thus, the district court did not err in permitting the jury to consider evidence of the existence of third party manufacturers of substantially similar dishes.
V
Related to Sweetheart’s argument that the admission of Detroit’s evidence of other manufacturers was prejudicial is it’s contention that the trial court committed prejudicial error in instructing the jury to consider evidence of Sweetheart’s delay in enjoining the other manufacturers in determining whether Sweetheart acquiesced in the use of the dish designs by others or abandoned its rights in the dish designs.
With respect to Detroit’s defense of es-toppel by acquiescence the trial court instructed the jury in part:
The defendant, thus, alleges that the plaintiff has acquiesced in such manufacture, sales by the other manufacturers and should now be estopped from asserting its rights, if any it has, in the design or configuration of its relevant containers against anyone, including this defendant.
If you should find from the preponder-anee of the evidence that others were manufacturing and selling containers very similar to the relevant containers of the plaintiff for a long period of time, and that plaintiff was aware of such manufacture and sale, then you must decide whether by taking no action against other manufacturers the plaintiff tes, agreed or acquiesced that the others can manufacture its very similar products. If you so decide, then the plaintiff may not now assert its rights against the defendant.
As distinguished from laches, acquiescence constitutes a ground for denial of relief only upon a finding of conduct on the plaintiff’s part that amounted to an assurance to the defendant, express or implied, that the plaintiff would not assert his trademark rights against the defendant, Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Veb Carl Zeiss Jena, 433 F.2d 686, 704 (2nd Cir.1970), cert. denied 403 U.S. 905, 91 S.Ct. 2205, 29 L.Ed.2d 680 (1971); Exxon Corp. v. Humble Exploration Co., Inc., 524 F.Supp. 450, 467 (N.D.Tex.1981), aff'd in part, rev’d and remanded in part, 695 F.2d 96 (5th Cir.1983). Acquiescence may be inferred from the trademark owner’s affirmative conduct toward the defendant. For example, in Ambrosia Chocolate Co. v. Ambrosia Cake Bakery, 165 F.2d 693 (4th Cir.1947), cert. denied 333 U.S. 882, 68 S.Ct. 914, 92 L.Ed. 1157 (1948), not only was the plaintiff aware that the defendant was using the plaintiff’s registered trademark “Ambrosia” for eight years but also the plaintiff attempted to sell ingredients to the defendant to be used in making “Ambrosia” cakes to be marketed under that name. The court found this to be “active encouragement” by the plaintiff to induce the defendant to sell its cakes under the name “Ambrosia”, and injunctive relief was denied. Estoppel by acquiescence focuses on a plaintiffs acts toward the defendant, not toward other manufacturers, See, e.g., id. Although Sweetheart’s delay in enjoining Detroit may be relevant to the question of whether Sweetheart acquiesced in Detroit’s manufacture of the dishes in question, Sweetheart’s delay in prosecuting infringers other than Detroit has no rele-vanee to the defense of estoppel by acquiescence. While abandonment results in a loss of rights as against the whole world, laches or acquiescence is a personal defense which merely results in a loss of rights as against one defendant. 2 J.T. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 31:14 at 587 (2d ed. 1984). ThuS) assuming that Sweetheart estab-lighed it had proprietary rights in its unregistered dish designs, the fact that Sweetheart may have delayed in enjoining other manufacturers from using the dish designs would not amount to an assurance to Detroit that Sweetheart would not assert its trademark rights against Detroit. The trial court’s instruction that the jury should consider the acts of Sweetheart toward third party manufacturers of similar designs rather than the acts of Sweetheart toward Detroit in determining estoppel by acquiescence was therefore erroneous.
,. . ,. .. rffms. whether evide"ce of S7ethearts delfy “ ^mmg other manufacturers is relevant to a determma-tlon of the of abandonment. With resPect to the evidence of Sweetheart s de-la^ m enjoining other manufacturers, the court mstracted the jury on abandonment:
If y°u should find from the preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff knowingly permitted other manufacturers to use the designs without any control, then you would find that plaintiff had abandoned or lost such rights,
There has been little uniformity among the courts as to the impact of a plaintiff’s failure to sue other infringers on the defense of abandonment. The line of cases relied on by Sweetheart states that evidence of a plaintiff’s failure to sue other infringers is totally irrelevant in an unfair competition case because “it is no excuse for [a defendant] to say that others have been guilty of the same wrong.” National Lead Company v. Wolfe, 223 F.2d 195, 204 (9th Cir.1955); United States Jaycees v. San Francisco Jr. Chamber of Commerce, 354 F.Supp. 61, 73 (N.D.Cal.1972), aff'd 513 F.2d 1226 (9th Cir.1975) (and cases cited therein). Although this theory is appealing because no one should be exculpated from his own wrongful conduct merely because others are also guilty, the view “assumes that the case of infringement has already been proven and that failure to prosecute, and its possible impact on customer perception, is irrelevant to the issue of likelihood of confusion.” 1 J.T. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 17:5 at 778 (2d ed. 1984). As discussed previously, the evidence of Sweetheart’s delay or failure to enjoin other manufacturers is not totally irrelevant in this case where Sweetheart has the burden of proving secondary meaning.

In the context of patent infringement, the concept of obviousness is crucial in determining the validity of a patent. The court needs to consider whether a person of ordinary skill in the field would have arrived at the claimed invention without resorting to inventive ingenuity. In the case of Anderson's patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.

In the reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court held that the patent in question did not meet the requirements of patentability because it was obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field. Similarly, in the reference case 106 F.2d 554, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.

In the case of Anderson's patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious because it was a combination of old elements that were well-known in the field. The court noted that the prior art references, such as the Thompson and Lampe patents, showed that the simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder was already known. The court also noted that the use of a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid was also known in the prior art.

Furthermore, the court found that the claimed invention did not have any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements. The court noted that the materials used in the prior art references did not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics, but the court still found that the prior art references were relevant to the issue of obviousness.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Anderson's patents was influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The court's finding of obviousness was based on the combination of old elements that were well-known in the field, and the court did not find any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements.

target_text: Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No. 2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise. The method and apparatus claimed by claim 11 of Anderson ’314 “would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * * ” (35 U.S.C.A. § 103) upon perceiving that the strand roving fell to the ground when the operator stopped the machine. “[I]t is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result.” Application of Demarche, 219 F.2d 952, 955, 42 CCPA 793 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 1955). Again, our conclusions in this regard are influenced by the fact that so little time elapsed between the introduction of roving in strands and the application for Anderson’s main patent. Compare Forestek Plating & Mfg. Co. v. Knapp-Monarch Co., 106 F.2d 554, 557 (6 Cir. 1939) (validity of improvement patent upheld in light of prior, repeated unsuccessful efforts).

winding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant’s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof. The Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel. When the thread breaks (or when the tension thereof decreases), the arm drops

This appeal is from judgment for plaintiff-appellee in a patent infringement suit, Ibis Enterprises, Ltd. v. Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court’s findings of fact as follows:
1. Parties
Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida, Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.
2. Civil Action
This is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.
3. Background of Patentee
David F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the “Vidal” process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: “hand lay-up” and “matched die (or metal) mold” (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).
4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method
The “Vidal” process involved, in part, the “hand lay-up” process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the “Vidal” process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).
5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method
(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called “matched metal mold” or “matched die” process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).
(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).
6. Anderson Early Work and Invention
(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the “matched metal mold” process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *
7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125
(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;
“the depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.” (Column 2, lines 39-52).
The form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).
(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:
“The present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.” (Column 1, lines 55-65).
'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed ■only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim ■6). * * ■*
11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit
(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).
(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff’s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend “Patented Process” while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs’ Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *
Yj * * *
(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).
(b) In the Defendant’s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).
18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs’
Each of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).
At this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the “clearly erroneous” limitation.
Second, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of “primary,” as opposed to “ultimate” fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).
Third, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court’s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court’s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.
Fourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. § 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.
Directing our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the “rather severe test” promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?” Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to “scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.” Ibid.
In light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson’s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.
As the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general — problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the “clearly erroneous” limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.
It is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson’s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson’s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).
Pursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson’s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of “obviousiness” and “newness” of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes — both relating to the making of pre-form — combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).
The final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson’s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at
143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, “in that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.” (Anderson deposition at 117).
A discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court’s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court’s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had “abandoned” its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility’s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson’s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.
Although certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson’s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.
The California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson’s case for improvement over the prior art as being “limited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.” Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).
Having thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson’s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention — subjecting Anderson ’125 to the “rather severe test” outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson ’125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of “obviousness” of the Anderson combination.
While it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus “occurred to me the moment I saw the roving.” (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or ’51, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson ’125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson’s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson’s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).
From this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson ’125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. § 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining “obviousness” under 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve — the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .
To summarize, the Anderson ’125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements “perform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that
“patentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun — a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.”
Our conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson ’125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.
Implicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.

{label: [2]} This should be [2] because the target text talks extensively about the claim 11 in Anderson's patent application, whereas the generation does not discuss. It does not make the citations in series - only cting them without breaks in-between would constitute that. Also the reason why you evaluate it as a 3 is actually the reason to rate it a 2. Not matching with the target text is considered an acceptable target mismatch. As long as it makes reasonable analysis it does not have to be exactly worded like the target text.

In the case of Westinghouse Electric Supply Company vs. Beattie, the company filed a petition to amend its alleged proof of claim by filing a formal proof of claim after the expiration of the six-months' period allowed for filing claims. The court has to decide whether the company can amend its claim after the expiration of the statutory period.

According to the reference case 21 F.2d 182, an amendment must be based upon an original claim, filed. The power of permitting amendment must not be perverted to let in dilatory creditors who have failed to file any proof of claim within the statutory year limited for filing claims. The court also stated that the allowance of the amendment addresses itself largely to the discretion of the court, provided there is a sufficient basis for the amendment.

In this case, the Westinghouse Company claimed that it had mailed a proof of claim to the referee on February 2, 1949, but it was never received by the referee. However, the referee found that no formal claim was filed by the Westinghouse Company within the statutory six-months' period and that no informal proof of claim had been established upon which an amendment might be predicated.

The reference case 20 F.2d 84 states that "where a paper presented for filing, although informal, contains the substance of a formal claim, it is sufficient as the basis of an amended claim filed after expiration of the year allowed by Bankruptcy Act, § 57n." However, in this case, the Westinghouse Company failed to file a formal claim within the statutory period and did not establish an informal proof of claim.

In conclusion, the court ruled that the Westinghouse Company cannot amend its claim after the expiration of the statutory period. The company failed to file a formal claim within the statutory period and did not establish an informal proof of claim. The court's decision is in line with the reference cases 21 F.2d 182 and 20 F.2d 84.

reference_case_1: 21 F.2d 182

ease itself, within the year fixed by the statute, to support an amendment after the expiration of the year. In Remington on Bankruptcy, vol. 2, § 747, it is said: “An amendment must be based upon an original claim, filed. And the power of permitting amendment must not be perverted to let in dilatory creditors who have failed to file any proof of claim within the statutory year limited for filing claims. # * * » Again in the same section it is said: “But, at any rate, the original proof need not be formal in order to support an amendment. Thus an agreement to accept a settlement, signed by the creditor and setting forth the amount and nature of his claim, will be sufficient to support an amendment. Again, a mere letter mentioning the claim, received by receiver and acknowledged by him to the creditor, has been held a sufficient basis.” It would seem from this authority and cases cited in the notes to section 747 that the allowance of the amendment addresses itself largely to the discretion of the court, provided there is a sufficient basis for the amendment. Again in the same authority (section 889), we find: “Of course, there must have been an original proof duly filed within the year; otherwise there would be nothing by whieh to amend; and the power of amendment is not to be distorted to let in dilatory creditors who have filed no proof within the limited year.

On September 17, 1951, the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company filed petition for review of an order of the referee in' bankruptcy entered September 7, 1951. The order appealed from denied the petition of the Westinghouse Company filed May 22, 1951, for leave to amend an alleged informal proof of its claim against the bankrupt by the filing of a formal proof, after the expiration of the six-months’ period allowed for filing claims.
On his voluntary petition Clarence R. Beattie was adjudged a bankrupt January 14, 1949, and George H. Cross was appointed and qualified as trustee of the bankrupt’s estate. The schedules listed the Westinghouse Company as an unsecured judgment creditor in the amount of $1-579.41. On February 2, 1949, attorney Harold H. Smedley of Muskegon, Michigan, who represented the Westinghouse Company, wrote the referee as follows: “Re : Clarence R. Beattie, bankrupt. Will you please advise the date of the first meeting of creditors in the above bankrupt matter?” At a hearing before the referee Smedley testified that with this letter he enclosed a proof of the claim of the Westinghouse Company. However, it appears that this proof of claim was never received by the referee. The next day, February 3d, the referee sent the usual form of notice to all creditors, including the Westinghouse Company and attorney Smedley, informing them that the first meeting of the bankrupt’s creditors would be held February 16th. This notice was never received by the Westinghouse Company, but Smedley testified that he received notice of such first meeting. However, it appears that Smedley was not present and that the Westinghouse Company was not represented at the creditors’ meeting on the 16th.
On April 14, 1949, the attorney for the trustee wrote Smedley as follows:
“I understand that you are local attorney for Westinghouse Electric Supply Company. I represent George FI. Cross, trustee of the above bankrupt (Clarence R. Beat-tie).
“The trustee is informed that on December 15, 1948, the bankrupt made a bulk sale of merchandise to Westinghouse without complying with the Bulk Sales Law. The amount involved was $242.30. The adjudication took place January 14, 1949.
“Will your client voluntarily pay the trustee $242.30 ? Are we misinformed about the transaction?”
On April 15th Smedley replied: “In reference to your letter of April 14, concerning the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company, I represented them in obtaining a judgment against Beattie on January 3, 1949, after having been endeavoring to collect $1,579.41 from them since October 22, 1948. T know of no bulk sales by Beattie to Westinghouse during that period of time. As far as I know and as far as my records disclose -you have been misinformed.”
On May 5th Smedley again wrote the attorney for the trustee: “In furtherance of your letter of April 14th concerning an alleged bulk sale to Westinghouse, there you have been misinformed. There was no such transaction. At one time, Beattie offered to return some merchandise for credit but it was refused. I have verified this with the Detroit attorneys for the Westinghouse Company.”
On September 23, 1949, Smedley wrote the trustee: “I think a further examination should be made as to where all the money went in this bankruptcy. Here is a signed statement Beattie made on January 5, 1948, in which he lists current assets at $53,150, with no liabilities. It was on this statement that the Westinghouse Electric Company sold the merchandise to this man. Will the trustee in bankruptcy do something about it?”
In reply to this last letter, the trustee wrote Smedley on September 24th as follows :
“I am in receipt of your letter of Sept. 23, enclosing statement furnished by the bankrupt to Westinghouse Electric Supply Co. under date of 1-5-48.
“A somewhat similar statement was furnished by the bankrupt to the B. F. Goodrich Company, and the matter was gone into quite fully before the referee in a hearing on the petition of the B. F. Goodrich Co. to reclaim certain merchandise alleged to have been sold in reliance upon such statement. The checks and bank deposit book of the bankrupt disclose that he did actually have on hand approximately $9,000 in cash or in the bank. The real estate which is valued in the statement at $22,500 was his home on Peck Street, the title to which stood in the joint names of himself and wife.
“If you think a further investigation should be made, I would suggest that you file a petition under the provisions of Sect. 21-a of the Bankruptcy Law.
“I am returning the statement which you enclosed.”
On July 20, 1950, Smedley wrote the referee in bankruptcy concerning the Beattie bankruptcy proceeding: “What is the present situation in the above named bankruptcy matter which occurred about a year ago? We filed a claim and never heard anything of it since. Was it closed? Was there any dividend?”
The statutory period for filing claims in the Beattie bankruptcy proceeding expired August 16, 1949. Section 57, sub. n of the Bankruptcy Act as amended, 11 U.S.C. § 93, sub. n, provides: “Except as otherwise provided in this Act, all claims provable under this Act, * * * shall be proved and filed in the manner provided in this section. Claims which are not filed within six months after the first date set for the first meeting of creditors shall not be allowed”.
On May 22, 1951, nearly two years after the expiration of the six-months’ period allowed for filing claims, the Westinghouse Company filed the following petition for leave to amend its alleged proof of claim by the filing of formal proof of claim:
“The petitioner Westinghouse Electric Supply Company, a Michigan corporation, by its attorney Harold H. Smedley, respectfully represents:
“1. That the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company is a judgment creditor of the above named bankrupt on a judgment rendered January 3, 1949 in the circuit court of the county of Muskegon in the amount of $1,579.41, with costs of $24.70.
“2. That a proof of claim of the above named creditor was on February 2, 1949 mailed to the above named referee in bankruptcy for the amount of $1,503.20, which was the amount remaining unpaid on said judgment.
“3. That said proof of claim was never filed in the bankruptcy court and hence said claim has not been allowed, although the claim does appear on the schedules filed with the bankruptcy court by the bankrupt.
“4. That your petitioner has at various times discussed this claim with the trustee and his attorney and that they have both acknowledged the validity and existence of this claim against the bankrupt estate.
“5. That the time for the filing of any new claims has expired the last date of filing being August 16, 1949, and that the claim of your petitioner as a new claim cannot now be duly filed.
“6. That your petitioner prays that an order be entered granting this petitioner the right to amend its claim so that its claim can be properly filed and allowed.”
This petition by Westinghouse to amend its claim appears to be based on the theory that even though it had not filed and proved its claim within the six-months’ period, the correspondence between its attorney and the trustee and his attorney and the referee constituted an informal proof of claim and a sufficient ground for granting leave to amend after the period for filing had expired.
In pursuance of its petition to amend, the Westinghouse Company about July S, 1951, tendered to the referee a formal proof of its claim against the bankrupt. Objections to the petition to amend and to the proposed formal claim were filed by the B. F. Goodrich Company, a creditor of the bankrupt. It appears that prior to the filing of the Westinghouse petition to amend, the trustee in bankruptcy had instituted suit in the circuit court of Muskegon county against the Goodrich Company to set aside certain transfers of property by the bankrupt, on the ground that the transfers were in violation of the so-called bulk sales law. As the amount of the trustee’s recovery in this suit against Goodrich would be limited to a total of the liabilities of the bankrupt, Goodrich as defendant in that suit had a vital interest in the Westinghouse claim, because if it were allowed, the contingent liability of Goodrich to the trustee would be increased by the amount of the claim.
In support of its petition to amend, the Westinghouse Company alleged that a formal proof of its claim was mailed by its attorney to the referee on February 2, 1949.. However, it appears from the record that this proof of claim was never received by the referee. The referee found that no formal claim was filed by the Westinghouse-Company within the statutory six-months’ period and that no informal proof of claim had been established upon which an amendment might be predicated. In its petition for review the Westinghouse Company contends that the referee erred in finding that it had not filed proof of its claim on February 2, 1949, and also erred in finding that it had not made such informal proof of claim as would entitle it to amend by filing formal proof after the expiration of the-six-months’ period.
There appears to be some dispute as to-whether, at the hearing before the referee, attorney Smedley testified that he mailed proof of the Westinghouse claim to the referee on February 2, or November 2,. 1949. However, this would seem to be immaterial, and in this opinion the court will assume that he mailed proof of claim to the referee on February 2, 1949, but that such proof was not received by the referee.
Assuming that proof of its claim was mailed to the referee within the statutory period for filing claims, that fact cannot aid the petitioner. The law is well established that the proof of claim must be- - filed within the statutory period and that merely placing a proof of claim in the mail properly addressed to the referee does not satisfy the filing requirement of section 57,. sub. n of the Bankruptcy Act. In the case of In re R. B. Rose Co., Inc., D.C., 43 F.2d 446, 447, the court said: “Section 57, sub. n * * * provides that ‘claims shall not be proved against a bankrupt estate subsequent to six months after the adjudication * * *.’ There is no statute authorizing the mailing the proof of claim or providing that mailing is sufficient. The creditor who selects-the mail as a vehicle for filing his proof of claim assumes the risk of loss or miscarriage. This is a well-known rule, and the fact that the lost paper is a proof of claim for filing with a referee in bankruptcy creates no exception.” See also In re Harris Bros., D.C., 5 F.Supp. 191.
