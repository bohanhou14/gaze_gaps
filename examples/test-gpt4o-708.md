Mr. Galvan’s failure to demonstrate prejudice is in line with precedents which outline that demonstrating prejudice is essential to consider ineffective assistance claims. Reference case 487 U.S. 326 emphasizes that in determining whether dismissal with or without prejudice is appropriate, the court must consider factors such as the seriousness of the offense and the impact of reprosecution on justice. Similarly, in 402 F.3d 1031, the court reiterated that time exclusions and dismissals are balanced by considering justice and the defendant’s rights.

Addressing dismissal due to Speedy Trial Act violations, as noted in 465 F.3d 458, it highlights that prejudice due to delays needs to be concrete, where mere procedural delays without substantial impact on the trial’s justice do not suffice. Mr. Galvan’s claim lacks sufficient prejudice evidence necessary under these precedents. Therefore, without demonstrating that the outcome of his proceedings would have been materially different, his assertions fail to meet the burden required for an ineffective assistance claim.

Cano-Silva, 402 F.3d 1031, 1034 (10th Cir.2005). In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the district court must consider “among others, each of the following factors: the seriousness of the offense; the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice.” 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2). “Prejudice to the defendant is among the ‘other’ factors the text of § 3162 directs the district court to consider.” United States v. Abdush-Shakur, 465 F.3d 458, 462 (10th Cir.2006) (citing United States v. Taylor, 487 U.S. 326, 334, 108 S.Ct. 2413, 101 L.Ed.2d 297 (1988)).
