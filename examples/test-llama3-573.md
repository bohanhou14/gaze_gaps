The scenario presented involves a divorce decree with a property settlement agreement that includes an obligation to make annual payments to a former spouse. The debt- or seeks to discharge this obligation, but the former spouse argues that the payments are in the nature of alimony and therefore nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5).

In reference case 101 B.R. 609, the court held that a payment obligation arising from a divorce decree was not dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5) because it was intended to provide support to the former spouse. Similarly, in reference case 736 F.2d 1314, the court held that a payment obligation arising from a divorce decree was not dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5) because it was intended to provide maintenance and support to the former spouse.

In the present case, the court must determine whether the annual payments to the former spouse are in the nature of alimony or a property settlement. The parties' characterization of the payments as alimony in the agreement provides persuasive evidence that the parties intended to create an alimony obligation. Additionally, the fact that the payments were secured by a life insurance policy and were not scheduled to terminate on the debt- or's death further supports the conclusion that the payments were intended to provide support to the former spouse.

Therefore, the court concludes that the annual payments to the former spouse are in the nature of alimony and are therefore nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5). The debt- or's complaint seeking to discharge this obligation is denied.

gold_text: In addition, the disparity in the parties’ financial circumstances at the time of the Dissolution supports the conclusion that the Annual Payments represented an alimony obligation. See Leppaluoto v. Combs (In re Combs), 101 B.R. 609, 617 (9th Cir. BAP 1989) (concluded that disparity in parties’ earnings supported conclusions that payments were in the nature of support); see also Shaver v. Shaver, 736 F.2d 1314, 1316—17 (9th Cir.1984); cf. In re Calhoun, 715 F.2d at 1108 n. 7 (stating that one of the factors which bankruptcy courts have examined in determining whether an obligation was in the nature of support is the “relative earning powers of the parties”). Indeed, although the Debtor and Clark opined that the defendant was not in need of support at the time of the dissolution, the Court notes that the defendant’s non-alimony taxable income for 1990 approximated $3,233.79. See Defendant’s Exhibit G.
