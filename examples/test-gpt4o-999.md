In addressing the Plaintiff’s state law claims for malicious prosecution and defamation, it is essential to consider the implications of legal precedents and statutory frameworks. The relevant reference cases, such as 29 F.3d 1244, stress the discretionary nature of pendent jurisdiction and emphasize that federal courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims if the federal claims are dismissed. Given that the § 1983 and § 1985 claims were dismissed, this court has the discretion to reject the state-law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).

The precedent set in United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, further supports that principle, indicating that when federal-law claims are dismissed before trial, the state-law claims should generally be dismissed as well. However, in this case, the court opted to address the state-law claims on their merits, which understandably had a preclusive effect.

For Zisis’s state law malicious prosecution claim, the Plaintiff must establish the requisite elements, but as analyzed in the context of the § 1983 claim, Zisis failed to demonstrate that the Defendants acted with malice or without probable cause. Consequently, this failure is parallel to his inability to establish a § 1988 claim, warranting summary judgment in favor of Defendants. 

Regarding the defamation claim, Zisis did not present sufficient legal arguments or factual evidence substantiating his claims against the Township or Uhrick. The lack of substantial evidence equivalent to the statutory and precedent benchmarks rendered his assertions insufficient under state law. Therefore, the court grants summary judgment in favor of the Defendants for the state law claims of malicious prosecution and defamation.

For these reasons, and consistent with precedents set forth in cases such as 29 F.3d 1244 and 383 U.S. 715, summary judgment is granted in favor of the Defendants.

gold_text: Since this court has granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants on all claims over which it had original jurisdiction, the court has the discretion to remand the remaining state claims to the Allen Superior Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1867(c)(3). However, the court may alternatively choose to retain its supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims and resolve them. “[A] district court should consider and weigh the factors of judicial economy, convenience, fairness and comity in deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction over pendent state-law claims.” Wright v. Associated Insurance Companies, Inc., 29 F.3d 1244, 1250 (7th Cir.1994) (citations omitted). “[T]he general rule is that, when all federal claims are dismissed before trial, the district court should relinquish jurisdiction over pendent state-law claims rather than resolving them on the merits.” Id. (citing United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966)). However, there are three well recognized exceptions to that rule. These include “when the statute of limitations has run on the pendent state law claim, precluding the filing of a separate suit in state court,” or “when ‘substantial judicial resources have already been committed, so that sending the case to another court will cause a substantial duplication of effort,’ ” or “when it is absolutely clear how the pendent state claims can be decided.” Id at 1251. In the present case, this court has already invested substantial judicial resources in this suit. Much of the court’s analysis, with respect to the federal claims is applicable to the state claims. Furthermore, the court determines that it is clear that Zisis’ state law claims against Uhrick and the Township have no merit. For these reasons, the court will exercise its supplemental jurisdiction and resolve the state law claims presented in this action.
