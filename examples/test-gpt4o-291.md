III. UNFAIR COMPETITION AND TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT CLAIM.

A. LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS.
To establish a likelihood of success on the merits for unfair competition and trademark infringement under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, Moen must demonstrate that its trade dress is distinctive and non-functional, and that Foremost’s product creates a likelihood of consumer confusion. In evaluating the latter, we consider factors such as the similarity between the two marks, the strength of Moen’s mark, and the evidence of actual confusion, among others.

Similar standards were utilized in Gorham Mfg. Co. v. White, 81 U.S. 511 (14 Wall. 511) in determining whether two designs are confusingly similar. Here, Moen asserts significant similarities in the overall appearance of the products that would likely deceive consumers.

B. IRREPARABLE HARM.
As established in Smith Int’l Inc. v. Hughes Tool Co., 718 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1983), where there is a strong showing of likely infringement, irreparable harm is presumed. Moen argues that continuation of Foremost’s conduct will result in substantial erosion of its market share, and given its significant investment in developing the Monticello line, this harm is irreparable.

C. BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS.
The balance of hardships tips in Moen’s favor. While Foremost will only be minimally affected by an injunction, Moen risks losing its substantial market presence and brand reputation, developed over years with significant investment.

D. PUBLIC INTEREST.
Public interest favors enforcing trademark protections to avoid consumer confusion and protect investment in product development. This principle was supported in PPG Indus., Inc. v. Guardian Indus. Corp., 75 F.3d 1558, 1567 (Fed.Cir.1996).

CONCLUSION
Plaintiff/movant has sufficiently established the requirements for the grant of a preliminary injunction on both design patent infringement and unfair competition and trademark infringement claims. It is hereby ordered that a preliminary injunction as requested is entered in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant.

With respect to this argument, as stated, Foremost presents no authority that a subsequently issued design patent on an accused product precludes infringement of a previously issued design patent. Moen, on the other hand, notes that in the seminal design patent case Gorham Mfg. Co. v. White, 14 Wall. 511, 81 U.S. 511, 528, 20 L.Ed. 731 (1871), the infringer had two design patents on the accused product, and the Supreme Court, nonetheless, held that the accused product infringed the earlier issued Gorham patent. In addition, with respect to utility patents, Moen notes that the Federal Circuit has stated that "[t]he grant of a separate patent on the accused device does not automatically avoid infringement, either literally or by equivalency.” National Presto Indus., Inc. v. West Bend Co., 76 F.3d 1185, 1191 (Fed.Cir.1996). See also Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. v. Sandee Mfg. Co., 126 U.S.P.Q. 32, 35 (N.D.Ill.), rev’d on other grounds, 286 F.2d 596 (7th Cir.1960). In light of the above, this court cannot find that the issuance of a subsequent design patent on an aspect of an accused product precludes infringement of a previously issued design patent:
