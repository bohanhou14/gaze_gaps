The case at hand involves a dispute between the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company and the State of Louisiana over the constitutionality of Act 188, a law that altered the funding formula for the Louisiana Workers' Compensation Second Injury Fund (SIF). The SIF was established in 1974 to encourage the hiring and retention of disabled workers. Under the 1974 Act, insurers paid a net amount of zero for claims made on the SIF and collected assessments from employers to pass through to the SIF.

However, Act 188 changed the assessment formula to be based on benefits paid under insurance policies written before the law's effective date, resulting in a substantial financial burden on the plaintiff insurance companies. The district court held that Act 188 did not violate the Takings Clause of the United States Constitution, but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, citing Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498, 118 S.Ct. 2131 (1998).

The Court of Appeals held that Act 188 as applied to the plaintiff insurance companies' pre-enactment contracts constitutes a taking without just compensation, citing Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978). The court found that the financial burden imposed by Act 188 was disproportionate to the plaintiff insurance companies' experience with the SIF and that the legislation was unnecessary to substantially advance a legitimate state interest.

In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeals relied on the Supreme Court's decision in Eastern Enterprises, which held that a regulatory taking must be evaluated based on the government's pattern of involvement in the regulated field and the extent to which the regulation interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations. The court also cited Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 475 U.S. 211, 106 S.Ct. 1018, 89 L.Ed.2d 166 (1986), which held that employers who knew of the possibility of a change in the funding mechanism for multiemployer pension plans were not entitled to relief.

The Court of Appeals ultimately held that Act 188 as applied to the plaintiff insurance companies' pre-enactment contracts violates the Takings Clause of the United States Constitution and reversed the district court's decision. The case was remanded for entry of appropriate injunctive relief
