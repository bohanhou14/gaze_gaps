**Generation:**

 Here is my attempt at writing the rest of the case:

In the instant case, we must determine whether the amended charge filed after the six-month limitation period relates back to the original charge. The respondent argues that the amended charge is a new and different charge alleging new and different unfair labor practices against a new and different respondent. However, we find that the amended charge is closely related to the original charge and alleges unfair labor practices that occurred within six months of the filing of the original charge.

As mentioned in National Labor Relations Board v. Gaynor News Co., 2 Cir., 197 F.2d 719, 721, the complaint need not be filed and served within the six months, and may therefore be amended after the six months. The holding of this decision may be summarized thus: (1) A complaint, as distinguished from a charge, need not be filed and served within the six months, and may therefore be amended after the six months. (2) If a charge was filed and served within six months after the violations alleged in the charge, the complaint (or amended complaint), although filed after the six months, may allege violations not alleged in the charge if (a) they are closely related to the violations named in the charge, and (b) occurred within six months before the filing of the charge.

In this case, the amended charge is closely related to the original charge, and alleges unfair labor practices that occurred within six months of the filing of the original charge. Therefore, we find that the amended charge relates back to the original charge, and the complaint is properly based on the amended charge.

Furthermore, as mentioned in National Labor Relations Board v. Indiana & Michigan Elec. Co., 318 U.S. 9, 18, 63 S.Ct. 394, 87 L.Ed. 579, the function of the charge is to set in motion the Board's investigatory machinery in order to ascertain whether a complaint shall issue; it is not a pleading. The requirements of a charge may be thought to place upon subsequent proceedings by the Board, but we can find no precedent that would restrict the Board's power to include in the complaint specific charges that were not included in the original charge.

In conclusion, we find that the amended charge relates back to the original charge, and the complaint is properly based on the amended charge. The amended charge is closely related to the original charge, and alleges unfair labor practices that occurred within

gold_text: In N.L.R.B. v. Dinion Coil Co., 2 Cir., 1952, 201 F.2d 484, a complaint was filed including employees in addition to others who allegedly had been discriminately discharged. The' original charge was made within the six months limitation but the enlarged charges by the complaint were without the limitation. The relating back theory was applied because all of the charges were closely related. See, also, to much the same effect N.L.R.B. v. Pecheur Lozenge Co., 2 Cir., 1953, 209 F.2d 393. See, also, N.L.R.B. v. Kobritz, 1 Cir., 1951, 193 F.2d 8. Much broader reasoning in applying the relating back theory will be found in Kansas Milling Co. v. N.L.R.B., 10 Cir., 1950, 185 F.2d 413, and in Cathey v. N.L.R.B., 5 Cir., 1951, 185 F.2d 1021, and Stokely Foods, Inc., v. N.L.R.B., 5 Cir., 1952, 193 F.2d 736; see also N.L.R.B. v. Bradley Washfountain Co., 7 Cir., 1951, 192 F.2d 144. We quote from National Licorice Co. v. N.L.R.B., 1940, 309 U.S. 350, 369, 60 S.Ct. 569, 579, 84 L.Ed. 799.
