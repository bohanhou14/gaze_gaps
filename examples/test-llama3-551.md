In analyzing the case, it is essential to consider the context in which Stritzl's employment was terminated. As a probationary employee, Stritzl's services could be terminated without a hearing or appeal, as recognized by the collective bargaining agreement in effect at the time of his discharge. This historical fact was further reinforced by the Postal Reorganization Act, which did not grant probationary employees the right to a hearing before their probationary employment was terminated.

In this regard, the court's decision is consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling in State University-Oshkosh, 408 U.S. 564, which held that the terms of an appointment did not secure an interest in re-employment and therefore did not require a hearing when the appointment was not renewed. Similarly, the court's decision is consistent with the Court of Appeals' ruling in Reference case 530 F.2d 1335, which held that the Communications did not create a Fourteenth Amendment property interest.

Furthermore, the court's decision is also consistent with the concept of liberty recognized by the Supreme Court in Board of Regents v. Roth, which recognized two particular interests of a public employee: the protection of his good name, reputation, honor and integrity, and his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities. In this case, Stritzl's discharge did not affect his liberty interest in the sense that it did not impinge upon his ability to take advantage of other employment opportunities.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject Stritzl's claim for a hearing before his probationary employment was terminated is consistent with the relevant legal precedents and the context in which Stritzl's employment was terminated. The court's decision is also consistent with the concept of liberty recognized by the Supreme Court.

gold_text: We do not regard the characterization of Stritzl by the Golden Post Office as one possessed of “poor work habits and low productivity” as the equivalent to the “badge of infamy” referred to an Constantineau. Nor does the characterization amount to a type of “stigma” recognized in Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) as requiring a hearing. In Weathers v. West Yuma County School District R-J-I, 530 F.2d 1335 (10th Cir. 1976), a school teacher’s employment contract was not renewed because of “overall performance.” The teacher later brought an action based, in part, on a “liberty interest” which he claimed he had been deprived of without due process of law. The trial court rejected that claim, and, on appeal, we affirmed with the following comment:
