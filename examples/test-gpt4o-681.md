We now turn to U.S. Healthcare's claims under section 2 of the Sherman Act. U.S. Healthcare alleges that Healthsource's exclusivity clause constitutes an attempt to monopolize the HMO market in New Hampshire. However, as established in reference case 816 F.2d 9, the monopolist's market power is not enhanced or reinforced merely by denying a facility to non-competitors. In this instance, Healthsource, acting in its capacity as an HMO and not as a public agency, cannot be found to have monopolized the market absent clear evidence of anti-competitive conduct and resultant market power harm. 

Furthermore, U.S. Healthcare's suggestion of potential injury must demonstrate harm to the competitive process rather than to competition itself, aligning with the precedent that antitrust laws protect competition, not competitors (429 U.S. 477).

Therefore, given the lack of compelling evidence for substantial foreclosure, anti-competitive effect, or intent to monopolize, U.S. Healthcare’s section 2 claim fails. We find no reason to overturn the magistrate judge's conclusion that the exclusivity arrangement does not unreasonably restrain trade under either section 1 or section 2 of the Sherman Act.

For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

gold_text: Whether the law requires such a further showing of likely impact on consumers is open to debate. Our own case law is not crystal clear on this issue. Compare Interface Group, Inc. v. Mass. Port Authority, 816 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir.1987), with Corey v. Look, 641 F.2d at 36. Ultimately the issue turns upon antitrust policy, where a permanent tension prevails between the "no sparrow shall fall" concept of antitrust, see Klor's, 359 U.S. at 213, 79 S.Ct. at 710 (violation "not to be tolerated merely because the victim is just one merchant whose business is so small that his destruction makes little difference to the economy"), and the ascendant view that antitrust protects "competition, not competitors". See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 488, 97 S.Ct. 690, 697, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977). We need not confront this issue in a case where the cardinal requirement of a valid claim — significant foreclosure unreasonably restricting competitors — has not been demonstrated.
