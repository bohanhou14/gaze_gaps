In reviewing the cases, it is clear that a pro se complaint, "however inartfully pleaded," must be held to "less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers" (Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972)). Furthermore, a court must construe a pro se complaint liberally (Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 292, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)). In considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the court must determine only whether the plaintiff should be allowed to present evidence on his claims (Mescall v. Burrus, 603 F.2d 1266, 1268 (7th Cir.1979)).

In the case at hand, Mr. Cleaves' complaint is a pro se complaint and must be held to less stringent standards. While some of the allegations may be unclear or inartfully pleaded, the court must construe the complaint liberally and consider the allegations as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss (Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 322 (1972)). Upon review of the complaint, it appears that Mr. Cleaves has stated a claim for retaliation under Title VII and a claim for violation of his equal protection rights under Section 1983.

The court need not dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, as the allegations, although inartfully pleaded, are sufficient to indicate that Mr. Cleaves has a valid claim (Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 9, 101 S.Ct. 173, 175, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980)). The court will allow Mr. Cleaves to present evidence on his claims, as the allegations are sufficient to indicate that a trial is necessary (Matzker v. Johnson, 748 F.2d 1142, 1144 (7th Cir.1984)).

In conclusion, the court finds that Mr. Cleaves' complaint is sufficient to state a claim and will not dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The court will allow Mr. Cleaves to present evidence on his claims and will consider the allegations as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss. The court

Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 9, 101 S.Ct. 173, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980). The court's role is to ensure that claims of pro se litigants are given "fair and meaningful consideration.” Matzker v. Herr, 748 F.2d 1142, 1146 (7th Cir.1984). Accordingly, pro se complaints must be liberally construed. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). The complaint need not specify the correct legal theory, nor point to the correct statute in order to survive a motion to dismiss. Bartholet v. Reishauer A.G. (Zurich), 953 F.2d 1073, 1078 (7th Cir.1992). Finally, a district court may dismiss a complaint only if "it • appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.” Hughes, supra, 449 U.S. at 10, 101 S.Ct. 173.
