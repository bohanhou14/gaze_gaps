The Deputy Commissioner's conclusion also contravenes established case law. Specifically, the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. § 920(a), creates a presumption that claims fall within the Act’s provisions unless substantial evidence to the contrary is presented (see 363 F.2d 682). The burden lies with the employer to rebut this presumption with substantial evidence (221 F.2d 886).

For instance, in Del Vecchio v. Bowers, 296 U.S. 280, the Court emphasized that the statutory presumption must benefit the claimant in the absence of substantial opposing evidence (206 F.2d 435). In the current case, there was no substantial evidence provided to counter the presumption that Steele’s hernia, and resultant death, were work-related injuries (380 U.S. 359).

Moreover, the Deputy Commissioner relied on hypothetical scenarios rather than concrete facts. The Act requires factual evidence to rebut the presumption of compensability, not speculative probabilities (363 F.2d 682). The substantial evidence standard was clearly not met in this scenario, necessitating the rejection of the Deputy Commissioner’s findings and the affirmation that Steele’s injuries were indeed work-related.

In light of these findings, the Deputy Commissioner’s decision is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to award compensation to the complainants.
