In the context of legal cases, specifically in the realm of design patents, the "point of novelty" approach is crucial in determining infringement. According to Litton Systems, Inc. v. Whirlpool Corp., 728 F.2d 1423, 1444 (Fed.Cir.1984), the focus lies in identifying those aspects of a design that distinguish it from prior art designs. This principle was reiterated in Winner Int'l Corp. v. Wolo Mfg. Corp., 905 F.2d 375 (CA Fed. 1990), where the court emphasized the importance of considering the overall configuration and appearance of a design in relation to prior art.

In the case at hand, Lawman Armor Corp. v. Winner Int'l, 2005 WL 354103 (E.D.Pa. Feb. 15, 2005), the district court granted summary judgment for Winner, concluding that the eight "points of novelty" specified by Lawman were actually disclosed in the prior art. Lawman argues that the district court failed to make sufficient findings regarding the scope and content of the prior art, as well as the "points of novelty" of the '621 patent. However, the court's decision is supported by the precedent set in cases such as Unidynamics Corp. v. Automatic Prods. Int'l, Ltd., 157 F.3d 1311, 1323 (Fed.Cir.1998), which emphasize the importance of comparing a design patent claim to the accused design under the "point of novelty" test.

Furthermore, the district court's ruling is in line with the Supreme Court's decision in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986), which states that summary judgment may be granted when there is no genuine issue of material fact. In this case, the court's determination that the prior art disclosed each of Lawman's specified "points of novelty" is supported by the evidence presented, and therefore, no genuine issue of material fact exists.

In conclusion, the district court's grant of summary judgment for Winner is consistent with the precedent set in design patent cases and the principles established in the "point of novelty" test. Lawman's arguments, although well-intentioned, do not provide sufficient grounds for reversing the district court's decision. The court's ruling is supported by the evidence presented and is in line with the applicable

gold_text: “The purpose of the ‘points of novelty’ approach ... is to focus on those aspects of a design which render the design different from prior art designs.” Winner Int'l Corp. v. Wolo Mfg. Corp., 905 F.2d 375, 376 (Fed.Cir.1990), overruled in part on other grounds by Cardinal Chem. Co. v. Morton Int'l., 508 U.S. 83, 113 S.Ct. 1967, 124 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). “New” designs frequently involve only relatively small changes in the shape, size, placement, or color of elements of old designs. It is those changes in and departures from the old designs that constitute the “points of novelty” in the patented new design.
