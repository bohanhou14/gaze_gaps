In the case of In re Davis, 16 B.R. 553 (Bkrtcy.S.D.Fla.1981), the court emphasized that a bankruptcy court has no authority to approve a sale of assets that are not property of the estate. Similarly, in the case of Engel v. Teleprompter Corporation, 703 F.2d 127, 131 (5th Cir.1983), the court held that assets or income of a corporation cannot be imputed to a shareholder absent some actual transfer.

In the case at hand, the sale of an asset by a corporation is imputed to the shareholder only if there is an actual or bookkeeping transfer of the asset from one entity to the other. Therefore, the court cannot find jurisdiction over the subject property unless there is a clear transfer of assets between the debtor and PCM.

In the case of In re Texaco, Inc., 182 B.R. 937, 944 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1995), the court recognized the importance of a bankruptcy court's jurisdiction to adjudicate controversies respecting, and to enforce, its own orders. However, in this case, the court's jurisdiction is limited to the assets of the debtor and cannot extend to PCM, which is not a debtor.

In the case of Folger Adam Security, Inc. v. DeMatteis/ MacGregor, JV, 209 F.3d 252, 257 (3d Cir.2000), the court held that a buyer can take ownership of property without concern that a creditor's lien continues to attach to the property. However, this principle does not apply to PCM, which is a separate legal entity from the debtor.

In conclusion, the court cannot grant the relief requested in the Declaratory Relief Action because the sale of an asset by a corporation is imputed to the shareholder only if there is an actual or bookkeeping transfer of the asset from one entity to the other. The court's jurisdiction is limited to the assets of the debtor and cannot extend to PCM, which is not a debtor. The Motion to Dismiss is granted, and the adversary proceeding is dismissed.
