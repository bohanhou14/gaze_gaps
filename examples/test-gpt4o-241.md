Brehm further argues that the application of the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA) is unjustified given the extraterritorial nature of his conduct. However, as established in United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, extraterritorial jurisdiction is properly exercised when significant American interests are implicated. The Yousef case upheld jurisdiction over a conspiracy to bomb American aircraft abroad, rationalizing that Congress intended for U.S. courts to preside over such extraterritorial crimes. Similarly, Brehm’s actions affected substantial U.S. interests at Kandahar Airfield, including maintaining order and supporting military operations.

Moreover, as delineated in Bowman, 260 U.S. 94, criminal statutes not strictly tied to locality, especially those protecting governmental functions and personnel, extend beyond territorial boundaries. This principle underscores the applicability of MEJA to Brehm's case, as his actions directly impacted U.S. military operations and personnel support in Afghanistan.

Given these precedents, MEJA's extraterritorial application is appropriate and constitutionally sound, reinforcing the conclusion that Brehm’s prosecution aligns with due process and congressional intent to safeguard American interests abroad.

Accordingly, we affirm Brehm's conviction under MEJA.

AFFIRMED.

The proposition that federal crimes are punishable though committed outside of the United States is not controversial, at least insofar as such prosecution is consistent with the law of nations and so long as the enactment evidences Congress's intent to extend its extraterritorial reach. See United States v. Bowman, 260 U.S. 94, 97-98, 43 S.Ct. 39, 67 L.Ed. 149 (1922). Indeed, in certain instances, Congress has been held unbound by international law, see United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 86 (2d Cir.2003), and its silence on extraterritoriality not determinative with respect to " 'criminal statutes which are, as a class, not logically dependent on their locality for the Government’s jurisdiction,’ ” id. (quoting Bowman, 260 U.S. at 98, 43 S.Ct. 39).
