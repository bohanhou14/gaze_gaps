In this case, the panel is divided as to whether it must be shown that it was reasonably foreseeable that Aaron's IM icon would reach the school property or whether the undisputed fact that it did reach the school pretermits any inquiry as to this aspect of reasonable foreseeability. However, we agree that, on the undisputed facts, it was reasonably foreseeable that the IM icon would come to the attention of school authorities and the teacher whom the icon depicted being shot.

As mentioned in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), the "reasonableness" of a police officer's actions in a Fourth Amendment context is an objective standard, not a subjective one. Similarly, in this case, we must evaluate the reasonableness of Aaron's actions in creating and transmitting the IM icon, not his subjective intent. As the court noted in Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978), "an officer's evil intentions will not make a Fourth Amendment violation out of an objectively reasonable use of force; nor will an officer's good intentions make an objectively unreasonable use of force constitutional."

In this case, it was reasonably foreseeable that the IM icon would create a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment. As noted in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969), school officials have the authority to discipline student speech that "materially and substantially disrupts the work and discipline of the school." The IM icon, which was transmitted to 15 recipients, including some of Aaron's classmates, was a form of speech that was reasonably likely to create such a disruption.

Therefore, we conclude that Aaron's creation and transmission of the IM icon was a form of speech that was not protected by the First Amendment. As noted in 420 U.S. 308, school officials have the authority to discipline student speech that is reasonably foreseeable to create a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment.

gold_text: Whether these aspects of reasonable foreseeability are considered issues of law or issues of fact as to which, on this record, no reasonable jury could disagree, foreseeability of both communication to school authorities, including the teacher, and the risk of substantial disruption is not only reasonable, but clear. These consequences permit school discipline, whether or not Aaron intended his IM icon to be communicated to school authorities or, if communicated, to cause a substantial disruption. As in Morse, the student in the pending case was not disciplined for conduct that was merely “offensive,” Morse, — U.S. at —, 127 S.Ct. at 2629, or merely in conflict with some view of the school’s “educational mission,” id. at 2637 (Alito, J., with whom Kennedy, J., joins, concurring). Although the Appellants contend that the First Amendment barred the imposition of any discipline, they make no distinct challenge to the extent of the discipline. Thus, we need not determine whether such a challenge would have to be grounded on the First Amendment itself or the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Cf. Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (“Because the Fourth Amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against this sort of physically intrusive governmental conduct, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of ‘substantive due process,’ must be the guide for analyzing these claims.”). And we are mindful that “[i]t is not the role of the federal courts to set aside decisions of school administrators which the court may view as lacking a basis in wisdom or compassion.” Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 326, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975). However, in the absence of a properly presented challenge, we do not decide whether the length of the one semester suspension exceeded whatever constitutional limitation might exist. We rule only that the First Amendment claims against the School Board and the Superintendent were properly dismissed, and that the state law claims were properly left for whatever state court adjudication might be available. We need not rule on the Superintendent’s defense of qualified immunity.
