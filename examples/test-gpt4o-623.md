2. The Amended Complaint as to the Maine Municipal Association

Turning to the Maine Municipal Association (MMA), the Court notes that Plaintiff introduced new allegations in her Amended Complaint. Given the principle that plaintiffs must exercise due diligence in amending their complaints, as emphasized in 445 F.3d 50, the Court recognizes that repeated opportunities to amend should not be granted indiscriminately. However, the amended pleading against MMA arguably presents claims that deserve further scrutiny. While the Court has misgivings about the justiciability of these claims, it opts to exercise its discretion, noted as not being abused in the referenced case, and allows this aspect of the amendment to proceed. This approach ensures that the plaintiff receives a fair opportunity to assert her claims while maintaining judicial efficiency and adhering to the standards set out in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a).

III. Conclusion
For the reasons noted above, the Court affirms the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision on the Motion to Dismiss as to DHHS. The Court also acknowledges the reference cases 371 U.S. 178 and 445 F.3d 50 that underpin the decision to treat procedural missteps cautiously but not to the detriment of judicial efficiency. The amended complaint against MMA will proceed, ensuring all claims are appropriately reviewed.

gold_text: “A district court may refuse an amendment to a complaint when the proposed amended complaint would still be subject to dismissal.” MacFarlane v. McKean, No. 92-2390, 1993 WL 349674, at *5, 1993 U.S.App. LEXIS 23463, at *15-16 (1st Cir. Sept. 14, 1993) (regarding the addition of parties under Rule 21, which requires leave of the court). MacFarlane distinguishes Rule 15(a), but only to the extent that Rule 15(a) “permits timely amendment of a complaint without leave of court.” Id. at *5, 1993 U.S.App. LEXIS 23463, at *15. In this case, Rule 15(a) leave is to be freely given, but not if dismissal is warranted. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962) (“In the absence of any apparent or declared reason — such as ... futility of amendment ... — the leave sought should, as the rules require, be ‘freely given.’ ”); Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of Puerto Rico, 445 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2006) (“When a proffered amendment comes too late, would be an exercise in futility, or otherwise would serve no useful purpose, the district court need not allow it.”). Because the Amended Complaint would not change the Court’s decision regarding DHHS’ Motion to Dismiss, the Court denies the motion to amend the complaint as to DHHS.
