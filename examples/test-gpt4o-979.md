Further, as established in Tran v. Tran, 54 F.3d 115, the court confirmed that claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) are to be heard in district court regardless of arbitration agreements imposed by employment contracts. The Court emphasized that congressionally granted FLSA rights hold precedence over conflicting arbitration provisions in union contracts, aligning with the rationale in Barrentine and Gilmer. This Court affirms the principle that arbitration cannot obscure statutory rights under the FLSA.

Moreover, the decision in Austin v. Owens-Brockway Glass Container, 78 F.3d 875, reinforces that arbitration should not preclude the judicial process for FLSA claims, showcasing judicial precedence emphasizing the non-arbitrability of FLSA claims when statutory provisions are in conflict with arbitration agreements.

Accordingly, Plaintiff's FLSA claim shall proceed in district court, and the arbitration agreement shall not serve as a barrier to such statutory rights. Therefore, while the motion to stay arbitration is granted for the state worker's compensation claim, it is denied concerning the FLSA claim.

gold_text: The Second Circuit adopts the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Barrentine that a person with an FLSA claim has a statutory right to have his case heard in court. See Tran v. Tran, 54 F.3d 115, 118 (2nd Cir.1995). Drawing from the reasoning in Barrentine, the Court held that the plaintiff was not required to exhaust his arbitration remedy, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, prior to filing his FLSA claims. See Tran, 54 F.3d at 118; See also Austin v. Owens-Brockway Glass Container, 78 F.3d 875, 883 (1996)(where the Fourth Circuit notes the Tran court’s distinction between FLSA and other statutory claims with regard to arbitration agreements and access to the courts). Therefore, under Barrentine and Tran a plaintiff bringing an FLSA claim has a right to have their claim heard in court before he exhausts his arbitration remedy pursuant to a signed agreement.
