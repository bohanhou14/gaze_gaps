**Generation:**

We find the district court's reasoning flawed as it fails to adhere to established legal standards for granting leave to amend. According to Rule 15(a), leave to amend "shall be freely given when justice so requires" (371 U.S. 178). The district court's refusal to allow Smith to amend his habeas petition overlooked the absence of bad faith, dilatory motive, or undue prejudice to the opposing party. Moreover, the judgment appeared to arbitrarily deny Smith the opportunity to present potentially exculpatory evidence, contrary to the Federal Rules favoring case resolutions on their merits (615 F.2d 606).

The assertion that the undisclosed tapes could materially impact Smith's defense elevates the necessity for their consideration in his habeas petition. The district court's failure to recognize this undermines the "spirit of the Federal Rules" and constitutes an abuse of discretion (95 F.3d 331). Notably, the circumstances indicate that the delay in presenting these tapes does not outweigh the potential injustice of not considering them.

Smith should have been granted the opportunity to amend his petition to address these new claims of prosecutorial misconduct. By arbitrarily denying this motion, the district court effectively hindered a fair and comprehensive review of Smith's case, warranting a vacatur of the court's judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this analysis (43 F.3d 922).
