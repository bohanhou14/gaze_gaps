Appellants also contest that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury’s verdict. However, it is well established that an appellate court rarely interferes with a jury verdict regarding contributory negligence (557 F.2d 1168). In this instance, the jury’s determination of the appellants' conspiracy to conceal and abduct the children falls under the same stringent standard. The record shows the acts committed by appellants, such as giving false testimony and aiding the father in absconding with the children, which substantially support the jury’s findings.

Regarding the appellants' argument that the damage awards were excessive, it is imperative to acknowledge that Texas law permits recovery of mental suffering damages if the tort is willful and intended to cause such anguish or if it is a reasonable consequence of the defendants' actions (268 F.2d 391). The jury's decision to award compensatory and exemplary damages aligns with this precedent, especially given the intentional and egregious nature of the appellants' actions.

Therefore, based on the above analysis and references, the district court's judgment, including the damages awarded, is well-supported by the record and applicable legal principles. The appellants' contentions do not warrant a reversal of the jury’s verdict or the district court’s judgment.

gold_text: Appellants’ remaining arguments are of little merit. There is no vagueness in an instruction requiring the jury to determine the damage caused by the defendants’ acts. We have reviewed the record and find that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict. Appellants argue, without citation of authority, that the district judge committed reversible error by refusing to instruct the jury that the mother must prove that a conspiracy existed prior to the date the complaint was filed and that the jury could not consider evidence of acts occurring after that date unless they first determined that a conspiracy existed prior to the date the complaint was filed. We are not aware of any such rule of law. The requested instruction is confusing at best. Texas courts allow great latitude in proving the conspiracy. Every circumstance that tends to illuminate the facts is a legitimate item of evidence. E. g., Foster v. Wagner, 337 S.W.2d 485, 493 (Tex.Civ.App.1960), rev’d on other grounds, 161 Tex. 333, 341 S.W.2d 887; Allison v. Simmons, 306 S.W.2d 206, 211 (Tex.Civ.App.1957). There was no error in denying the requested instruction. Finally, the exemplary damage awards were not excessive as a matter of law because they are not “so large as to show ‘passion or prejudice’ or so large as to ‘shock the conscience’.” Wiley v. Stensaker Schiffahrtsqes, 557 F.2d 1168, 1171 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1087, 98 S.Ct. 1282, 55 L.Ed.2d 792, quoting Fruit Industries, Inc. v. Petty, 268 F.2d 391 (5th Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 915, 80 S.Ct. 261, 4 L.Ed.2d 186.
