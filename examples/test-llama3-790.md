In the context of the Rehabilitation Act, a prima facie case of disability discrimination requires the plaintiff to show that she is a disabled person, otherwise qualified for the position, and that the employer failed to provide a necessary accommodation. As the United States Supreme Court held in Arline v. School Bd. of Nassau County, 107 S.Ct. 1123 (1987), an employer has an affirmative obligation to make reasonable accommodations for handicapped employees. The burden is on the employer to present credible evidence that a reasonable accommodation is not possible in a particular situation.

In the case at hand, the plaintiff, Karen A. Willard, failed to identify a vacant, funded position that she was qualified for, with or without accommodation, that existed at the time of her request for reassignment. This failure to identify a necessary accommodation precludes her from establishing a prima facie case. As the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held in Peltier v. United States, 388 F.3d 984 (2004), a plaintiff must identify a vacant, funded position for which she was qualified, with or without accommodation, that existed at the time of her request for reassignment.

The defendant, the United States Postal Service, argued that it did engage in an interactive process with the plaintiff, but even if it did not, summary judgment is warranted by the failure of the plaintiff to identify a vacant, funded position that the interactive process would have led to. As the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held in Donahue v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 224 F.3d 226 (2000), in a failure-to-transfer case, if, after a full opportunity for discovery, the summary judgment record is insufficient to establish the existence of an appropriate position into which the plaintiff could have been transferred, summary judgment must be granted in favor of the defendant.

In conclusion, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment because the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiff failed to identify a vacant, funded position that she was qualified for, with or without accommodation, that existed at the time of her request for reassignment. As the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held in Peltier v. United States, 388 F.3d 984 (2004), a plaintiff must identify a vacant, funded position for which she was qualified, with or without accommodation, that existed at the time of her request for reassignment

gold_text: Willard’s final contention is that summary judgment was improper because the defendant had not satisfied its burden of proving that the requested accommodation was unreasonable. For this argument, she relies on the statement in Hall v. United States Postal Service, 857 F.2d 1073 (6th Cir.1988), that “[t]he burden is on the employer to present credible evidence that a reasonable accommodation is not possible in a particular situation.” Id. at 1080 (citations omitted). Hall is distinguishable because there is no “particular situation” for the employer to address here since Willard has not identified any vacant, funded positions that she was qualified to perform. In Hall, the court was faced with the question of whether a reasonable accommodation would enable the plaintiff to perform the functions of an already identified position; it was not presented with the threshold issue of the need to identify a position in the first place. Such identification is part of a plaintiffs prima facie case, and the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case before she can prevail on a claim of disability discrimination. See Gaines v. Runyon, 107 F.3d 1171, 1175 (6th Cir.1997). Once that has happened, “the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the employee cannot reasonably be accommodated.... ” Id. If, however, “the plaintiff fails to establish a ptima facie case, it is unnecessary to address the question of reasonable accommodation.” Id. at 1176 (citing Jasany v. U.S. Postal Serv., 755 F.2d 1244, 1250 (6th Cir.1985); Sisson v. Helms, 751 F.2d 991, 993 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 846, 106 S.Ct. 137, 88 L.Ed.2d 113 (1985); Daubert v. U.S. Postal Serv., 733 F.2d 1367 (10th Cir.1984); Pushkin v. Regents of Univ. of Colo., 658 F.2d 1372, 1387 (10th Cir.1981)). Because Willard has not established a prima facie case, the defendant was never eonfi’onted with the burden of demonstrating that the proposed accommodation was not reasonable. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot survive summary judgment on the basis that the defendant did not meet that burden.
