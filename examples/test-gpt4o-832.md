Allocating Funds for Potential Tax Liabilities and Withdrawal Penalties
Weitzman's request to reserve funds to cover potential tax liabilities and early withdrawal penalties associated with the forfeiture of his assets lacks merit. The legislative history of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 clarifies that the term "proceeds" should be used instead of "profits" to alleviate the burden on the government from proving net profits and overhead expenses (see Reference Case 775 F.2d 492). This indicates that considerations of tax liabilities and penalties do not impede the forfeiture process under the statute. Weitzman’s argument to reserve funds for potential tax liabilities and penalties is therefore unfounded as the overarching goal of 21 U.S.C. § 853(p) is to secure forfeitable assets, irrespective of potential tax consequences.

Moreover, established case law indicates that defects in forfeiture proceedings can be mitigated by ensuring de facto notice, which cures procedural defects (see Reference Case 129 F.3d 1293, citing United States v. Sarbello, 985 F.2d 716, 721). This reinforces the principle that statutory mandates should not be circumvented by potential ancillary obligations such as taxes or penalties.

Accordingly, Weitzman's objections and requests concerning the allocation of funds for potential tax liabilities and withdrawal penalties do not present a valid legal barrier to the forfeiture of the identified substitute assets.

Conclusion
For the reasons discussed, the Government’s motion for a Preliminary Order of Forfeiture as to Substitute Assets is granted. The Court finds that the substitute assets identified, including IRAs and other assets, are subject to forfeiture pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 853(p).

gold_text: Although Weitzman does not know what, if any, tax liabilities and withdrawal penalties he may incur if the substitute assets are forfeited, he requests that sufficient funds be set aside to cover any such obligations that may arise. Courts have declined to deduct taxes from the value of the assets forfeited, in part to avoid requiring complex calculations. See, e.g., United States v. DeFries, 129 F.3d 1293, 1315 (D.C.Cir.1997) (when determining assets to be forfeited, “a deduction for taxes could create unwarranted complexities in the administration of the statute”). Requiring the Government to account for possible tax liabilities and early withdrawal penalties before forfeiture would needlessly complicate the process. Additionally, given the punitive purpose of forfeiture, the possibility that Weitzman may have to pay additional taxes and withdrawal penalties for substitute assets forfeited is not unjust. See United States v. Lizza Indus., Inc., 775 F.2d 492, 498 (2d Cir.1985) (no need for the Government to “ensure that a convicted racketeer is not deprived of a single farthing more than his criminal acts produced”). Accordingly, the Court denies Weitzman’s request to reserve funds for the purpose of covering any possible tax liabilities and early withdrawal penalties.
