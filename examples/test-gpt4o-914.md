The question at hand revolves around the voluntariness of the accused's confession and whether it was obtained through coercion or improper inducement. In examining the voluntariness of confessions, several precedents stand out. For instance, in United States v. Guarno, 819 F.2d 28, it was noted that promises of leniency do not inherently render a confession involuntary unless the circumstances suggest coercion. Similarly, in United States v. Pelton, 835 F.2d 1067, the court emphasized that a suspect's personal characteristics and the context of the interrogation must be considered. Pelton's confession was found voluntary despite his belief in receiving leniency.

Furthermore, the cumulative effect of multiple inducements has been scrutinized. In United States v. Tingle, 658 F.2d 1332, the court held that a confession induced by a combination of promises and threats could be deemed involuntary. However, representations made by officers, such as informing a prosecutor about a suspect's cooperation, do not necessarily render a confession involuntary if not accompanied by coercive tactics (835 F.2d 1067).

In the current case, despite the pre-rights statement by the investigators, subsequent proper advisement provided the accused with the necessary warnings. This aligns with the ruling in United States v. Castro, 813 F.2d 571, where the court upheld a conviction despite redacted evidence as long as the overall circumstances indicated voluntariness (882 F.2d 645). Therefore, the trial court correctly ruled that the confession was obtained without unlawful coercion or inducement, maintaining both procedural and substantive due process protections. Thus, the Air Force Court of Military Review’s reliance on presumptive taint was misplaced and legally erroneous.

gold_text: Federal civilian practice does not support a finding of involuntariness simply because a police officer told a suspect in a noncommittal manner that he would call the appropriate authorities’ attention to a suspect’s cooperation with police. See United States v. Alvarado, 882 F.2d 645, 650 (2d Cir.1989), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 1114, 107 L.Ed.2d 1021 (1990); United States v. Leon Guerrero, 847 F.2d 1363, 1367 (9th Cir.1988); United States v. Pelton, 835 F.2d 1067, 1073 (4th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1010, 108 S.Ct. 1741, 100 L.Ed.2d 204 (1988); United States v. Guarno, 819 F.2d 28, 30-31 (2d Cir.1987); Layne v. State, 542 So.2d 237, 240-41 (Miss.1989). However, a specific threat to report a suspect’s failure to cooperate with police to appropriate authorities may render a subsequent confession involuntary in these same courts, assuming it is the motivating factor in the suspect’s decision to speak. Cf. United States v. Crespo de Llano, 838 F.2d 1006, 1015-16 (9th Cir.1987); United States v. Pelton, supra at 1072-73; United States v. Tingle, 658 F.2d 1332, 1336 n.5 (9th Cir.1981). See generally United States v. Spaulding, supra at 161. Consideration of the voluntariness question in light of these decisions as well would be particularly appropriate. See United States v. Johnson, 9 USCMA 591, 26 CMR 371 (1958); cf. United States v. McKay, 9 USCMA 527, 26 CMR 307 (1958).
