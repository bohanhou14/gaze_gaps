MANSFIELD, District Judge (continued).

In United States v. Abrams, 29 F.R.D. 178, 183 (S.D.N.Y.1961) and as stated in the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, the procedural norm mandates that statements made by witnesses are to be produced only after the witness has testified at trial, reinforcing that an all-encompassing request for pre-trial discovery would undermine this principle (Ref: 348 F.2d 217). Consequently, general demands lacking specificity, such as those made by Hernick, do not meet the requisite threshold of materiality and reasonableness for pre-trial discovery.

Further, aligning with United States v. Tane, 29 F.R.D. 131 (E.D.N.Y.1962) and Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 214, 71 S.Ct. 675 (1951), Rule 17 of the F.R.Crim.P. does not serve as an independent discovery tool supplementary to Rule 16, but rather operates within a narrowly defined scope. The indiscriminate nature of the Movant’s request under Rule 17 thus fails to demonstrate the necessary relevance and non-duplicative means of obtaining the materials sought.

Moreover, the call for grand jury testimony cannot be granted absent a particularized need, indicating the limited applicability of the general rule of grand jury secrecy as discussed in 379 F.2d 365. Exceptions to this rule are constrained to circumstances where non-disclosure could compromise national security or is otherwise justifiably restricted.

In conclusion, the overarching demand for all-encompassing discovery, devoid of clear relevance and materiality, stands in violation of established legal precedents and procedural norms (Refs: 348 F.2d 217; 379 F.2d 365), justifying its denial on these grounds.

gold_text: Insofar as Movant seeks prior statements of witnesses to be called by the Government, he is amply protected by Title 18 U.S.C. § 3500 which entitles him, after they have testified, to examine their prior statements relating to the subject matter of their direct testimony. United States v. Giuliano, 348 F.2d 217, 223 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 939, 946, 86 S.Ct. 390, 406, 15 L.Ed.2d 349, 354 (1956). In addition he may examine their Grand Jury testimony after they have testified, see Dennis v. United States, supra; United States v. Youngblood, 379 F.2d 365 (2d Cir. June 21, 1967). In the event that such Jencks Act material or Grand Jury testimony is voluminous, the Government is directed to submit the same to the Court before commencement of trial so that the trial judge may determine, in the exercise of his discretion, whether to order that the material be furnished to defense counsel before completion of a witness’ testimony, in order to afford counsel adequate opportunity to use such material upon cross-examination and undue delay during the trial.
