In denying Guinn's motion for appointment of counsel, we look to the precedent set forth in 6 F.3d 147, where the court emphasized that indigent litigants are not entitled to appointed counsel unless "exceptional circumstances" are present. The magistrate judge correctly exercised broad discretion under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d), finding no such circumstances in Guinn's case. Additionally, in 741 F.2d 22, the court stressed that the complexity of the issues and the merits of the claim should be considered in deciding requests for counsel. Given Guinn's failure to demonstrate the merit or complexity of his Eighth Amendment claim, the magistrate judge's decision to deny counsel was not an abuse of discretion. Consequently, the District Court's denial of the motion for appointed counsel stands, supporting the summary judgment's affirmation.

Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 158 (3d Cir.1993). Guinn’s filings reflect that he was able to present and litigate his case and did not show that without counsel, he would be prejudiced. Id.; Smith-Bey v. Petsock, 741 F.2d 22, 26 (3d Cir.1984). The District Court also did not err in denying Guinn’s motion for a temporary restraining order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 65.
