The reference cases of 17 F.3d 671 and 4 F.3d 223 provide valuable insights into the scope of appellate review of remand orders. In Graham v. United States, 17 F.3d 671, the court held that a collateral order that preceded the remand decision was reviewable, whereas an issue that was not separable from the remand decision was not. Similarly, in City of Waco v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 293 U.S. 140, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934), the Supreme Court recognized that a separate decision preceding the remand could be reviewed.

In the present case, the District Court's order was based on a procedural defect in the notice of removal, which is a ground within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c). As such, the remand order is not reviewable under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d). This is consistent with the holding in Balazik v. County of Dauphin, 44 F.3d 209, 213 (3d Cir.1995), which stated that failure of all defendants to join in the removal petition constitutes a defect in removal procedure.

Defendants' argument that the court should disregard the rule of unanimity because of improper service or the presence of nominal or fraudulently joined defendants is not persuasive. The District Court's finding that plaintiff properly served on Sud Voyages and Palm Tours in Morocco and that they were not nominal or fraudulently joined defendants is binding on this court.

In conclusion, the District Court's order to remand the case to state court is not reviewable under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d) because it was based on a procedural defect in the notice of removal. The present case is distinguishable from City of Waco v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 293 U.S. 140, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934), as the District Court's decision to remand was not preceded by a separable decision.

gold_text: Following Waco, we have held that “a district court cannot prevent appellate review of a final collateral order by contemporaneously remanding a case to state court.... Such an order, however, must satisfy two separate jurisdictional requirements. First, it must avoid the bar to appellate review in 28 U.S.C. 1447(d). Second, it must satisfy the finality requirement of 28 U.S.C. 1291.” Carr v. American Red Cross, 17 F.3d 671, 675 (3d Cir. 1994) (citing Powers v. Southland Corp., 4 F.3d 223, 226 (3d Cir.1993). Under the first prong, “the order must be both logically precedent to, and separable from, the remand decision.” Id. Defendants contend that the District Court’s remand is “based on its finding that Sud Voyages and Palm Tours actually are defendants in this litigation. The decision is the substantive decision on which the remand depends. If that decision is incorrect, the remand is incorrect. Thus the District Court’s remand order is reviewable.” Grey Br. at 5. This argument is unavailing.
