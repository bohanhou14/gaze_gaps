The cases presented here involve complex legal issues related to jurisdiction, res judicata, and the application of federal statutes. In the case of 305 U.S. 165, the Supreme Court held that a bankruptcy court's confirmation of a plan of reorganization is res judicata, meaning it is binding and cannot be challenged in a subsequent lawsuit. This principle is relevant in the present case, where the appellant seeks to challenge the validity of a sentence imposed by a federal court.

In the case of 59 S. Ct. 134, the Supreme Court held that a state court's determination of a question of federal law is binding on a subsequent federal court. This principle is relevant in the present case, where the appellant seeks to challenge the validity of a sentence imposed by a federal court.

In the case of 308 U.S. 371, the Supreme Court held that a bankruptcy court's confirmation of a plan of reorganization is res judicata, meaning it is binding and cannot be challenged in a subsequent lawsuit. This principle is relevant in the present case, where the appellant seeks to challenge the validity of a sentence imposed by a federal court.

In the case of 110 F.2d 72, the Court of Appeals held that a receiver's attempt to establish the validity of a claim in a state court is not the same as bringing an action at law. This principle is relevant in the present case, where the appellant seeks to challenge the validity of a sentence imposed by a federal court.

In conclusion, the cases presented here demonstrate the importance of considering the principles of res judicata and the application of federal statutes in determining the validity of a sentence imposed by a federal court. The appellant's challenge to the sentence must be denied, as the sentence was properly imposed and is binding on the appellant.
