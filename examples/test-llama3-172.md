The Western Pacific Railroad Corporation, the plaintiff, claims that it is entitled to a paid allocation of the income tax savings resulting from the reorganization of its operating railroad company, Western Pacific Railroad Company, the defendant. The plaintiff's claim is based on the argument that the tax savings were a product of the plaintiff's ownership of the defendant's stock and that the defendant's profits during the reorganization period were equivalent to the plaintiff's losses.

The court, in a lengthy and detailed decision, rejected the plaintiff's claim, citing the principles of equity and justice. The court held that the tax savings were not a product of the plaintiff's ownership of the defendant's stock, but rather a result of the defendant's profitable operations during the reorganization period.

The court also noted that the tax savings were not a form of income that could be shared between the parties, but rather a benefit that accrued to the defendant as a result of its profitable operations. The court further held that the plaintiff's claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata, as the issue of the plaintiff's interest in the defendant's profits had been decided in a prior reorganization proceeding.

The court's decision is consistent with the principles of equity and justice and is supported by the cases of United States v. Isham, 17 Wall. 496, U.S. 496, and Ecker v. Western Pacific Railroad Corporation, 318 U.S. 448, 63 S.Ct. 692, 87 L.Ed. 892. The court's decision also recognizes the importance of the reorganization statute and the need to respect the decisions made in prior reorganization proceedings.

In conclusion, the court's decision is a fair and just one that reflects the principles of equity and justice. The plaintiff's claim was properly rejected, and the defendant's profits during the reorganization period were correctly recognized as
