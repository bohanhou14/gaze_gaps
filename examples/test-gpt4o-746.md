Garwood, Circuit Judge:

C. Other Relevant Precedents
To further support our decision, we reference several pivotal rulings. In **529 U.S. 473**, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded a case to ensure further proceedings were consistent with its opinion, highlighting the necessity of adherence to procedural timings and filings. Similarly, in **150 F.3d 429**, the court underscored that a Certificate of Appealability (COA) is a prerequisite to appellate review, and a specific request must address each issue explicitly. Gonzales's lack of due diligence in filing his Motion for Reconsideration and not refiling it after obtaining the Boykin transcript fails this prerequisite, mirroring the procedural oversight emphasized in the referenced case.

Moreover, **116 F.3d 149** emphasizes that issues rejected by lower courts, especially those deemed untimely, should not be entertained on appeal. This is applicable to Gonzales's COA request concerning equitable tolling. The court in that case expressly declined to address issues waived at the district level and which fell outside the COA ambit. Therefore, Gonzales's circumstances do not warrant deviation from these established principles, affirming the district court’s judgment.

CONCLUSION
As Gonzales is not entitled to equitable or statutory tolling for the time period during which he awaited his trial transcript pursuant to the instructions of the trial judge, his motion for federal post-conviction relief was not timely and was properly denied with prejudice.

AFFIRMED.

gold_text: . Both Gonzales and the state make arguments in their briefs that fall outside the scope of the COA. For example, Gonzales extensively briefed the merits of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In his brief, he also claims that his actions were not illegal because he lacked specific intent, that the weapons he used in the events at issue in his case were not his, and that he only used force in self defense. A COA is required to appeal the denial of a state prisoner's habeas application. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(A); Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1600, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). A COA shall issue "only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2). The COA “shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(3). If a district court partially grants a COA and certifies some, but not all, issues raised by an applicant in the district court, the applicant may move this court to extend the order granting a COA to issues that the district court refused to certify. United States v. Kimler, 150 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir. 1998). To move this court to extend the order granting a COA requires an “express request” from the applicant. Id. at 431 n. 1. Merely briefing issues outside the ambit of the COA does not satisfy this requirement. See id. at 431 & n. 1. Gonzales has not made such a request to expand his COA to include any of the additional issues raised in his brief. Because this court’s review is limited to the issue specified in the grant of COA, Gonzales's arguments outside the scope of the COA need not be considered, and we do not consider them. Lackey v. Johnson, 116 F.3d 149, 152 (5th Cir. 1997).
