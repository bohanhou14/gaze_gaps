Rodriguez's main contention is that given his two mandatory consecutive 84-month sentences, the high-end 71-month sentence for conspiracy was excessive and substantively unreasonable. He posits that a lower-end guideline sentence would fulfill the statutory purposes outlined in § 3553(a). 

We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. The district court is not required to detail every single § 3553(a) factor but must show it has considered them (Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597). Here, the court did acknowledge these factors, including the victim's ongoing trauma, as grounds for the high-end guideline sentence. 

Rodriguez's argument mirrors those previously affirmed. In a similar case, Hunt’s 10-month sentence within the guidelines was upheld as reasonable given the court's articulated need for deterrence (United States v. Pugh, 515 F.3d 1179, 1190; 526 F.3d 739). Similarly, the presumption of reasonableness for guideline-range sentences, as stated in Rita, binds here (551 U.S. 338; 612 F.3d 1160). The district court and the Sentencing Commission’s agreement on the sentence enhances its probable reasonableness (Rita, 551 U.S. at 347).

Thus, Rodriguez has not demonstrated that the sentence is substantively unreasonable when assessed against the totality of the circumstances and relevant § 3553(a) factors (United States v. Tome, 611 F.3d 1371, 1378). Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court’s sentencing decision.

We reverse only if “left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the § 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.” United States v.
