The Drivers' case is unripe for several reasons. Firstly, the Ordinance's provisions regarding disclosure of qualifying driver information do not constitute a concrete and particularized injury. The Drivers do not identify the legal wellspring of their claimed privacy rights nor show how the disclosure of the information presents a "risk of real harm" to each Driver "personal[ly] and individual[ly]" (Spokeo, 136 S.Ct. at 1548-49). The Drivers' own conduct, such as obtaining business licenses and disclosing information in a public and searchable municipal database online, belies their assertion of injury.

Secondly, the Drivers' claim that certification of an exclusive driver representative will result in a contract governing the manner in which they can do business with Uber and/or Lyft is speculative. No QDR has successfully procured the support of the majority of either Uber or Lyft's qualifying drivers. It is unclear whether Local 117, another entity, or no entity at all, will become the EDR for Uber and Lyft's drivers.

Lastly, the Drivers' claim that the Ordinance's certification process will violate their federal right under Section 8(b)(4) not to be subject to union campaigns prohibited by that statute is also unripe. The Drivers anticipate a coercive campaign by Local 117, but they do not provide any facts about the foreseen campaign, much less offer any facts showing that such a campaign would be coercive within meaning of Section 8(b)(4) (DeBartolo, 485 U.S. at 578, 108 S.Ct. 1392).

In conclusion, the Drivers' case is unripe because the claimed injuries are speculative, lack concrete and particularized harm, and do not meet the requirements of Article III of the Constitution (Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1138). The case must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

gold_text: Finally, the Drivers cite to authorities that do not support their position. The Drivers cite to Babbitt v. United Farm Workers National Union , 442 U.S. 289, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979), for the proposition that the Drivers need not "await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief." Id. at 298, 99 S.Ct. 2301 (quoting Pennsylvania v. West Virginia , 262 U.S. 553, 593, 43 S.Ct. 658, 67 L.Ed. 1117 (1923) ). However, the Drivers ignore the language surrounding the quoted sentence, which makes clear that an injury that is "certainly impending ... is enough," id. (emphasis added) (quoting Pennsylvania , 262 U.S. at 593, 43 S.Ct. 658 ), and that "[a] plaintiff who challenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute's operation or enforcement," id. (emphasis added) (citing O'Shea v. Littleton , 414 U.S. 488, 494, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974) ). As discussed above, the Drivers' theories of injury do not meet these criteria.
