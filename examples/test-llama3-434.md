The court's decision is supported by substantial evidence. The treating physician's opinion is given substantial deference, but it is not conclusive. The ALJ's decision is reasonable and supported by the record. The court cannot base its decision on a single piece of evidence and disregard other pertinent evidence when evaluating whether substantial evidence in the record exists (Hephner v. Mathews, 574 F.2d 359, 362 (6th Cir.1978)). The ALJ's decision is not arbitrary or without a rational basis (Kirk v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 667 F.2d 524, 538 (6th Cir.1981)). The plaintiff's claim of disability is based exclusively on a mental impairment, and there is no evidence of an exertional disability (Richey v. Sec'y of Health and Human Servs., 984 F.2d 1232, 1235 (6th Cir.1993)). The ALJ's conclusion that the plaintiff could perform work that does not require complex tasks, hourly quotas, or frequent contact with other people, and required only rarely dealing with co-workers and minimal supervision is reasonable and supported by the evidence (Lashley v. Sec'y of Health and Human Services, 708 F.2d 1048, 1054 (6th Cir.1983)). The vocational expert testified that the jobs of groundskeeper, farm laborer, and cleaner fit the plaintiff's limitations and existed in significant numbers in the national economy (Duncan v. Sec'y of Health and Human Services, 801 F.2d 847, 852-53 (6th Cir.1986)).

The court finds that the plaintiff's objections are without merit. The ALJ's decision is supported by substantial evidence and is reasonable. The court affirms the Commissioner's decision. (Casey v. Sec'y of Health and Human Services, 987 F.2d 1230, 1232 (6th Cir.1993)).

gold_text: A Rule promulgated by the Secretary states that: “more weight [will be given] to opinions from your treating sources, since these sources are likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed, longitudinal picture of your medical impairment(s) and may bring a unique perspective to the medical evidence that cannot be obtained from the objective medical findings alone or reports of individual examinations, such as consultative examinations or brief hospitalizations.” 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(2). The Sixth Circuit has consistently applied this rule. A treating physician’s opinion should be given greater weight than those opinions of consultative physicians who are hired for the purpose of litigation and who examine the claimant only once. See Jones v. Sec.’y of Health & Human Services, 945 F.2d 1365, 1370 n. 7 (6th Cir.1991); Farris v. Sec’y of Health & Human Services, 773 F.2d 85, 90 (6th Cir.1985). If a treating physician’s opinion is not contradicted, complete deference must be given to it. Walker v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 980 F.2d 1066, 1070 (6th Cir.1992); King v. Heckler, 742 F.2d 968, 973 (6th Cir.1984). However, a treating physician’s opinion may be rejected if there is good reason to do so. Hall v. Bowen, 837 F.2d 272, 276 (6th Cir.1988). The Sixth Circuit has held that treating physicians’ opinions “are only given such deference when supported by objective clinical evidence.” Warner v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 375 F.3d 387, 390 (6th Cir.2004) (citing Jones v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 336 F.3d 469, 477 (6th Cir.2003)). Where a treating physician renders an opinion using legal language as opposed to medical terminology, the Court likewise may reject it if it is not supported by clinical evidence in the record. See Casey v. Sec’y of Health & Human Services, 987 F.2d 1230, 1234-35 (6th Cir.1993).
