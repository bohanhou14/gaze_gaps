I'm happy to help you write a summary of the legal cases. Based on the provided references, I will summarize the key points and highlight the relevance of each case.

The first reference, 205 F.2d 538, is a case involving a dispute over the taxation of a company's income. The court held that the company's net proceeds from the sale of cattle were properly includible in its income for the year 1947. The court also refused to consider the government's contention that the company had erroneously deducted the cost of animals purchased for its breeding herd as an ordinary business expense.

The second reference, 243 F.2d 584, is a case involving a dispute over the depreciation of a contract. The court held that the contract was not subject to depreciation and that the company was not entitled to a deduction for the claimed depreciation. The court noted that the burden of proof is on the taxpayer to establish the deductibility of the claimed expense.

The key takeaways from these cases are that the courts are careful to scrutinize the taxpayer's claims and that the burden of proof is on the taxpayer to establish the deductibility of the claimed expense. These cases highlight the importance of careful record-keeping and documentation in tax disputes.

In conclusion, these cases demonstrate the importance of understanding the tax laws and regulations in order to navigate complex tax disputes. The courts are careful to scrutinize the taxpayer's claims and require strong evidence to support the deductibility of claimed expenses.
