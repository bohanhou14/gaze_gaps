In analyzing the case, it is essential to understand that the court's decision is based on objective standards rather than subjective ones. In the context of 28 U.S.C. § 1915, "good faith" must be judged objectively, as stated in Reference case 369 U.S. 438. This means that a defendant's good faith is demonstrated when they seek appellate review of any issue that is not frivolous.

In the case at hand, the defendant's claims of a speedy trial and the right to call witnesses are unfounded and lack merit. The court has already rejected these claims on direct review, as mentioned in United States v. Guanti, 421 F.2d 792, 798, 800 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 832, 91 S.Ct. 65, 27 L.Ed.2d 64 (1970). Furthermore, the court has determined that the delay in bringing the case to trial was caused by the defendant's own flight from an earlier trial and their failure to demand a speedy trial.

Additionally, the defendant's claim that they were denied the right to call witnesses is also untenable, as explained in Reference case 261 F.2d 215. The court has determined that the dispersal of any of the defendant's witnesses in the interim between their arrest and trial is clearly attributable to the defendant themselves.

In conclusion, the court's decision is based on objective standards, and the defendant's claims lack merit. The court has already rejected these claims on direct review, and the defendant's failure to demand a speedy trial and their involvement in the state custody for a separate and distinct offense further support the court's decision.
