The state procedural rules cited by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals to strike Hansbrough's second notice of appeal do not meet the threshold of being "firmly established and regularly followed" as required by established jurisprudence. In Barr v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 146, 149 (1964) and NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Flowers, 377 U.S. 288, 297 (1964), the Supreme Court held that state procedural rules that are not regularly or strictly followed cannot bar federal review. Similarly, in 373 U.S. 284 and the referenced case 781 F.2d 1458, it was emphasized that procedural novelties or inconsistencies cannot obstruct federal oversight.

Here, Alabama's lack of a clear legal precedent stipulating that a voluntary dismissal of an appeal is with prejudice exemplifies a procedural anomaly. Additionally, there is no precedent that post-trial motions have no tolling effect if a notice of appeal is already pending, as recognized in case 466 U.S. 341. This inconsistency with established standards means Hansbrough's procedural default does not constitute an adequate state ground to preclude federal review.

The Alabama Court’s unexpected application of procedural rules without clear precedent or consistent application represents an arbitrary enforcement that cannot fairly preclude Hansbrough’s federal constitutional claims from being reviewed. Given this context, under the precedents set by 498 U.S. 411 and other cited cases, Hansbrough is entitled to federal review due to the inadequacy and lack of regular application of the state procedural grounds invoked.

For these reasons, we reverse the district court’s decision and remand for consideration of the merits of Hansbrough’s habeas petition.

Kentucky, 466 U.S. 341, 348-51, 104 S.Ct. 1830, 1835-36, 80 L.Ed.2d 346 (1984), in holding “that only a ‘firmly established and regularly followed state practice’ may be interposed by a State to prevent subsequent review by this Court of a federal constitutional claim.” Novel procedural requirements or those of whose existence the defendant could not reasonably be deemed to have been apprised, cannot be permitted to thwart review of cases seeking vindication in state courts of federal constitutional rights.
