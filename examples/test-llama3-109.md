In the case of Jackson v. Sec'y for the Dep't of Corrs., 292 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2002), the court ruled that a district court may review sua sponte the timeliness of a section 2254 petition, even if the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense. This ruling is relevant to the present case, as it highlights the importance of considering the timeliness of a rescission claim under the ILSFDA.

In the case of Acosta v. Arbuz, 221 F.3d 117, 124 (2d Cir.2000), the court held that a failure to plead the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense constitutes a waiver of the defense. This ruling is relevant to the present case, as it suggests that Holiday Isle's failure to plead the two-year rescission period as an affirmative defense may have waived its ability to raise this defense.

In the case of Hill v. Braxton, 277 F.3d 701, 706 (4th Cir.2002), the court held that a failure to provide notice of the right to rescind may not extend the two-year rescission period. This ruling is relevant to the present case, as it suggests that Holiday Isle's failure to provide notice of the right to rescind may not have extended the two-year rescission period.

In the case of Seaboard Sur. Co. v. Garrison, Webb & Stanaland, P.A., 823 F.2d 434, 438 (11th Cir.1987), the court held that a failure to provide notice of the right to rescind may not be a basis for equitable tolling. This ruling is relevant to the present case, as it suggests that plaintiffs' failure to provide notice of the right to rescind may not be a basis for equitable tolling.

In the case of Smith v. FCX, Inc., 744 F.2d 1378, 1379 (4th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1103, 105 S.Ct. 2330, 85 L.Ed.2d 848 (1985), the court held that a failure to provide notice of the right to rescind may not extend the two-year rescission period. This ruling is relevant to the present case, as it

gold_text: . The only case that plaintiffs cite in support of the proposition that lack of notice of their right of rescission extends or eliminates the § 1703(c) deadline is Engle Homes, Inc. v. Krasna, 766 So.2d 311 (Fla.App. 4 Dist.2000). In Krasna, the court did not examine the statutory language in meaningful detail, but instead held in conclusory terms that the purchasers could not have timely waived their right to rescind the contract because the right of rescission was not expressly stated in the contract, and the purchasers did not learn of that right until 31 months after the fact. Krasna’s reasoning is problematic and ultimately unavailing to plaintiffs for three reasons. First, the doctrine of waiver generally does not apply to a plaintiff's failure to bring an action within a statutory limitations period; rather, waiver is generally discussed in terms of a defendant's waiver of a right to invoke the limitations defense. See generally Day v. Crosby, 391 F.3d 1192, 1194 (11th Cir.2004) ("In an ordinary civil case, a failure to plead the bar of the statute of limitations constitutes a waiver of the defense.") (citation omitted). Second, Krasna’s determination that the purchasers could not be held accountable for a statutory limitations period of which they were not aware is contrary to well-established law concerning tolling of such periods. A plaintiff’s lack of knowledge of a limitations deadline is generally not an excuse for his failure to comply with it. See, e.g., Wakefield v. Railroad Retirement Bd., 131 F.3d 967, 970 (11th Cir.1997) (“Ignorance of the law usually is not a factor that can warrant equitable tolling.”); Whitt v. Stephens County, 529 F.3d 278, 2008 WL 2122814, *5 n. 7 (5th Cir. May 21, 2008) (opining that "neither excusable neglect nor ignorance of the law is sufficient to justify equitable tolling of limitations”) (citation omitted). Third, even if Krasna’s waiver analysis were appropriate here, plaintiffs have submitted no evidence that they were in fact unaware of their rescission rights until after the two-year window had passed. Unadorned representations of counsel in a summary judgment brief are not a substitute for appropriate record evidence. See generally Nieves v. University of Puerto Rico, 7 F.3d 270, 276 (1st Cir.1993) (“Factual assertions by counsel in motion papers, memoranda, briefs, or other such ‘self-serving’ documents, are generally insufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact at summary judgment.”); Bowden ex rel. Bowden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 124 F.Supp.2d 1228, 1236 (M.D.Ala.2000) (“opinions, allegations, and conclusory statements of counsel do not substitute for evidence”); Williams v. Saxon Mortg. Co., 2008 WL 45739, *5 n. 9 (S.D.Ala. Jan. 2, 2008) (similar).
