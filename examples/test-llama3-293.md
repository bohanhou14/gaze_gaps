In the case of Tamela Montgomery v. City of Ames, et al., the plaintiff alleges that the defendants, including the City of Ames and several police officers, violated her constitutional right to bodily integrity by creating the danger that Angenaldo Bailey would attack her and by acting with deliberate indifference to that danger. The plaintiff argues that the defendants' actions were reckless and conscience-shocking, and that they failed to protect her from Bailey's violent attack.

To establish a constitutional violation, the plaintiff must show that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to her safety. In the case of DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989), the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause does not provide a cause of action for a state's failure to protect an individual against private violence. However, the Court also established that a state may have a duty to protect an individual in certain circumstances, such as when the individual is in the state's custody or when the state created the danger to which the individual is subjected.

In this case, the plaintiff argues that the defendants created the danger that Bailey would attack her by failing to arrest him after she reported that he had violated a protective order. However, the court finds that there is insufficient evidence to show that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's safety. In the case of Hart v. City of Little Rock, 432 F.3d 801, 805-06 (8th Cir.2005), the court held that deliberate indifference requires both that the official be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists and that the official actually draw that inference.

In this case, the court finds that the defendants were aware of the risk that Bailey posed to the plaintiff, but that they did not act with deliberate indifference to that risk. The court also finds that the defendants' failure to arrest Bailey was not conscience-shocking, as it was reasonable for them to investigate the allegations before taking action. Therefore, the court grants summary judgment to the defendants on the plaintiff's constitutional claims.

The court also finds that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiff's state-law claims, as there is no clearly established constitutional right that was violated in this case. In the case of Fields v. Abbott, 652 F.

gold_text: We also affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment for Officers Owens, Ropp, and Crippen. Montgomery’s complaint against these defendants is that they “failed to timely respond to [her] medical needs.” The claims fail because nothing the officers did — or did not do — established either a state-created danger or special relationship that imposed on them an affirmative duty to protect Montgomery from third-party harm. See Gatlin ex rel. Estate of Gatlin v. Green, 362 F.3d 1089, 1093 (8th Cir.2004). Without a state-created danger or special relationship, a failure to respond does not violate due process. See DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 197, 109 S.Ct. 998; Weeks v. Portage Cnty. Exec. Offices, 235 F.3d 275, 277-79 (6th Cir.2000); Bryson v. City of Edmond, 905 F.2d 1386, 1392-93 (10th Cir.1990).
