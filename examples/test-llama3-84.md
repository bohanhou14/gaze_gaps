In this case, the plaintiff is seeking to recover damages for the wrongful death of Carl Eberle, who was killed in a gas explosion while repairing a gas line owned by Sinclair Prairie Company. The plaintiff has already filed a previous suit against McGeorge Corporation and Vetchel Hailey, which resulted in a compromise and settlement agreement.

The defendant, Sinclair Prairie Company, has filed a motion to dismiss the current suit, arguing that the plaintiff is barred from bringing a new action due to the judgment entered in the previous suit. The plaintiff has attempted to reserve her rights against other tort-feasors, but the court holds that this is insufficient to overcome the bar of the previous judgment.

In support of this conclusion, the court cites Rule 12(b)(6), 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, which authorizes a motion to dismiss a complaint for "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." The court also references cases such as New Orleans, M. & T. Railroad Co. v. Ellerman, 105 U.S. 166, 26 L.Ed. 1015, and Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 218 U.S. 88, 30 S.Ct. 651, 54 L.Ed. 946, which hold that a judgment on the merits is a bar to further action by the parties.

Furthermore, the court notes that the plaintiff's attempt to reserve her rights against other tort-feasors is insufficient to overcome the bar of the previous judgment. The court references cases such as Cain et al. v. Quannah Light & Ice Company, 131 Okl. 25, 267 P. 641, and City of Wetumka v. Cromwell-Franklin Oil Co. et al., 171 Okl. 565, 43 P.2d 434, which hold that a plaintiff can have but one satisfaction for a joint wrong.

In conclusion, the court grants the defendant's motion to dismiss the current suit, holding that the plaintiff is barred from bringing a new action due to the judgment entered in the previous suit.

gold_text: Rule 12 (b) (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for a motion to dismiss for “failure to staté a claim upon which relief can be granted”. This defense, together with five others named in Rule 12 (b), may be presented prior to the filing of the responsive pleading. Moore on Federal Practice, volume 1, page 646, discusses these six ■ defenses which may be presented by motion and reaches the conclusion that, since defenses 1 to 5 may be supported by affidavits, it is quibbling to say that defense No. 6 may not be supported by affidavits. I am not able to agree with this conclusion, for there is a difference in the language of the rules. The language of defense No. 6 shows that the failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted has reference to the complaint filed by the plaintiff. In no other pleading has the plaintiff made an effort to “state a claim”. When a motion to dismiss under Rule 12 (b) (6) is presented to the court, the question for the court to determine is whether or not the plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief may be granted. This court, in Baker v. Sisk, decided December 17, 1938, and reported in volume. 1 F.R.D. at page 232, 236, in discussing this motion, stated, “The motion to dismiss provided for under the rules is not designed to reach a case in which the plaintiff would not be entitled to any relief after the matters of defense have been presented. In other words it may not be substituted for an answer”. The courts are almost unanimous in holding that a motion to dismiss tests the sufficiency of the complaint and that in passing upon said motion the court looks to the allegations of the complaint, and to those allegations alone; and that all matters of fact well pleaded are taken as true. Sheehan v. Municipal Light & Power Company et al., D.C., 1 F.R.D. 256; Sherover v. John Wanamaker, D.C., 29 F.Supp. 650; McConville v. District of Columbia et al., D.C., 26 F.Supp. 295; Nielson v. Farley et al., D.C., 26 F. Supp. 948; L. Singer & Sons et al. v. Union Pacific Railroad Company (Kansas City, Mo., v. L. Singer & Sons et al.), 8 Cir., 109 F.2d 493. The best statement of this construction of the rule is contained in Leimer v. State Mutual Life Assurance Company of Worcester, Mass., 8 Cir., 108 F.2d 302, 305. Therein the court, speaking through Judge Sanborn, said: “Under the present practice, we think, the making of a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted has the effect of admitting the existence and validity of the complaint as, stated, but challenges the right of the plaintiff to relief thereunder. * * * In view of the means which the Rules of Civil Procedure afford a defendant to obtain a speedy disposition of a claim which is without foundation or substance, by either securing a more definite statement or a bill of particulars under Rule 12 (e) and thereafter applying for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12 (h) (1), or by moving for a summary judgment under Rule 56, we think there is no justification for dismissing a complaint for insufficiency of statement, except where it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff would be entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in support of the claim.”
