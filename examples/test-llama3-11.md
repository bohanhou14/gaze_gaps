This case presents the question whether an employee welfare benefits plan creates an entitlement to lifetime benefits or just to benefits that can be terminated by an amendment to the plan. The plan administrator, Motorola, amended the plan to place a two-year limit on benefits for disability resulting from certain mental conditions, including the plaintiff's condition.

The plaintiff, Marrs, argues that the plan's provision stating that no amendment shall adversely affect the rights of any participant to receive benefits with respect to periods of disability prior to the adoption date of the amendment is violated. He interprets "periods of disability prior to the adoption date" to mean one or more periods of disability that began before the plan was amended but may not have ended before then. However, the plan administrator's interpretation is reasonable, and we are inclined to stop with that observation.

The Supreme Court's decision in Glenn v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008)) is relevant in this case. The Court held that a conflict of interest by the plan administrator should be given weight in judicial review of the denial of benefits. However, the weight to be given to the conflict of interest depends on the circumstances of the case.

In this case, the plan administrator had an incentive to resolve a close case in favor of a denial of benefits, but this incentive may be outweighed by other incentives, such as an employer's interest in maintaining a reputation among current and prospective employees for fair dealing. The employees who actually decide benefits claims at the plan-administrator level may not be acutely concerned with the financial implications of a benefits award for their employer.

We conclude that the plan administrator's decision to deny benefits is reasonable and that the conflict of interest does not render the decision unreasonable. The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.

gold_text: There are two ways to read the majority opinion. One, which tracks its language and has been echoed in opinions in this and other circuits, e.g., Jenkins v. Price Waterhouse Long Term Disability Plan, 564 F.3d 856, 861-62 (7th Cir.2009); Holland v. Int’l Paper Co. Retirement Plan, 576 F.3d 240, 246-49 (5th Cir.2009), makes the existence of a conflict of interest one factor out of many in determining reasonableness. That sounds like a balancing test in which unweighted factors mysteriously are weighed. Such a test is not conducive to providing guidance to courts or plan administrators. “Multifactor tests with no weight assigned to any factor are bad enough from the standpoint of providing an objective basis for a judicial decision; multifactor tests when none of the factors is concrete are worse.” Menard, Inc. v. Commissioner, 560 F.3d 620, 622-23 (7th Cir.2009) (citations omitted); see also Sullivan v. William A. Randolph, Inc., 504 F.3d 665, 671 (7th Cir.2007); Short v. Belleville Shoe Mfg.
