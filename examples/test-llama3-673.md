In order to determine whether Rezner's RICO claim is valid, we must consider whether HVB's fraud against the United States caused his injury. HVB argues that Rezner's own actions caused his alleged injury, but this is not supported by the evidence. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), a person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of RICO may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court.

In Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479 (1985), the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff must allege each of the elements of a violation of RICO, including conduct, an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and injury to business or property. In this case, Rezner has alleged that HVB engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, including fraud, and that this conduct caused him injury to his business or property.

HVB argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Rezner because Rezner has failed to establish that HVB's fraud against the United States caused his injury. However, the district court's decision was based on the undisputed evidence, which showed that HVB's fraud caused Rezner's alleged injury. Therefore, we must affirm the district court's decision.

In conclusion, Rezner's RICO claim is valid because HVB's fraud against the United States caused his injury. The district court's decision was based on the undisputed evidence, and we must affirm it.

gold_text: To state a civil claim for a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must show “(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.” Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). To have standing under civil RICO, Rezner is required to show that the racketeering activity was both a but-for cause and a proximate cause of his injury. See Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992). Proximate causation for RICO purposes requires “some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.” Id. Rezner argues that HVB’s defrauding of the United States through the CARDS facility caused his injury. There is no dispute that HVB defrauded the United States through CARDS. We hold, however, that HVB’s fraudulent activity towards the United States did not cause Rezner’s injury.
