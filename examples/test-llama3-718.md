In the case of 640 F.2d 1296, the court held that the Commissioner's position on the I.R.C. § 482 imputed interest income issue was substantially justified. The court found that the Commissioner's position had a reasonable basis in law and fact, as it was based on the Treasury Regulation interpreting and applying I.R.C. § 482. The regulation provides that where a controlled entity makes a loan or advance to another controlled entity without charging interest or charging interest at a rate that is not equal to an arm's length rate, the district director may make appropriate allocations to reflect an arm's length rate of interest for the use of such loan or advance.

The court also noted that the Commissioner's position was not necessarily based on the final outcome of the case, but rather on the facts and circumstances surrounding the case. This is in line with the Supreme Court's decision in Phillips v. Commissioner, 851 F.2d 1492, 1499 (D.C.Cir.1988), which held that a substantial justification finding is based on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case, not solely upon the final outcome.

In this case, the Commissioner believed that the Messmans avoided income taxes by forgiving the interest on loans made by one of their wholly-owned subsidiaries to others. The court found that the Commissioner's position had a reasonable basis in law and fact, as it was based on the Treasury Regulation interpreting and applying I.R.C. § 482. Therefore, the Commissioner's position on the I.R.C. § 482 imputed interest income issue was substantially justified, and the Tax Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Messmans' petition for litigation costs.

The Messmans argue that I.R.C. § 482 is not applicable .because the funds that Marco Oil provided to RAM Drilling and TMC Farms were capital contributions, not loans. The Messmans assert that, even though the financial arrangements between Marco Oil and RAM Drilling and TMC Farms were labeled loans, it is the substance of the transactions, not the terminology used to describe them, that matters: We agree that, although the denomination given the transactions is relevant, it is not determinative. Post Corp. v. United States, 226 Ct.Cl. 343, 640 F.2d 1296, 1304 (1981). The problem with the Messmans’ argument is that in this case, leaving aside the terminology used, all the other aspects of the initial transactions between Marco Oil and RAM Drilling and TMC Farms indicate the transactions were loans. After all, payment agreements were executed; there is no evidence that the funds were intended as equity investments in RAM Drilling and TMC Farms; an interest rate was originally set at 14%; and the payments made by the companies were recorded in loan repayment schedules.
