KOZINSKI, Circuit Judge:
Today we consider the sad story of John R. Mann, a Chapter 11 debtor in possession who lost his property while pursuing his dreams. He appeals the district court's affirmance of various bankruptcy court decisions that permitted the foreclosure sale of his home and his subsequent eviction.

As per 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(2), when all parties consent to the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction in a related non-core proceeding, the district court reviews the bankruptcy court's findings of fact for clear error. Here, Mann chose to file this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court, and he never objected to the court's jurisdiction prior to the time it rendered judgment against him. Through this conduct, he consented to the court's jurisdiction. See 819 F.2d 914, 918-19 (9th Cir.1987); 809 F.2d 329, 331 (6th Cir.1987).

Mann appeals the district court's orders affirming the bankruptcy court's determination that the transaction between Mann and ADI was a bona fide loan transaction and that ADI could foreclose its deed of trust to recover money owed it. Mann also appeals the district court's affirmance of the bankruptcy court's clarification of its order lifting the automatic stay, permitting ADI to enforce its unlawful detainer judgment against Mann.

As per 11 U.S.C. § 363(m), an appeal of a bankruptcy court's ruling on a foreclosure action generally cannot affect the rights of a good faith purchaser of the foreclosed property, unless the debtor stays the foreclosure sale pending an appeal. See 846 F.2d 1170, 1171-73 (9th Cir.1988). In this case, Mann did not stay the foreclosure sale pending an appeal, and therefore, his appeal is moot. Additionally, the bankruptcy court allowed the debtor more than fourteen months to try to sell the property prior to the foreclosure sale, yet Mann was unable to find a buyer at any price.

The decisions of the district court are affirmed in their entirety. This matter is remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings regarding ADI's attorneys' fees.

gold_text: . Bankruptcy courts may hear two categories of proceedings: core proceedings as defined in 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2), and non-core proceedings that are "otherwise related to a case under title 11.” Id. § 157(c)(1). The latter category is very broad, DuVoisin v. Foster (In re Southern Indus. Banking Corp.), 809 F.2d 329, 331 (6th Cir.1987), including nearly every matter directly or indirectly related to the bankruptcy. But see Kelley v. Nodine (In re Salem Mortgage Co.), 783 F.2d 626, 634.(6th Cir. 1986) (28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(1) does not include proceedings involving transactions or events with only "an extremely tenuous connection” to the bankruptcy).
