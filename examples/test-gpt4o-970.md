The ordinance's prohibition on off-premises signs like billboards is not unprecedented. As noted in Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, the prohibition of offsite advertising can be directly related to objectives like traffic safety and aesthetics. The ordinance reflects a decision by the city that commercial onsite advertising is more critical than offsite advertising.

Moreover, the absence of time limits for permitting decisions renders such ordinances invalid as it constitutes a prior restraint on speech (Granite State Outdoor Adver., Inc. v. City of Clearwater, Fla., 410 F.3d 1250). As seen in 453 U.S. 490, the city's decision to prohibit off-premises advertising is reasonably concluded to be more detrimental to traffic safety and esthetics than onsite advertising, which aligns with the city's stated objectives.

The ordinances should also be content-neutral, ensuring that any restrictions placed upon speech should not be based on the content itself. Indeed, the absence of clear judicial review procedures or accelerated timelines might encroach upon First Amendment protections (541 U.S. 774).

In conclusion, given these precedents, this Court finds that the City's ordinance constitutes an unconstitutional restraint on speech, thereby entitling the Plaintiff to monetary damages.
