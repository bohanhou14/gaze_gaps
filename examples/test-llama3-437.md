In the context of the instant action, the issue at hand concerns the determination of the amount of plaintiff's invested capital for the year 1918. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue deducted the total amount of the dividend declared by the resolution of January 25, 1918, from plaintiff's invested capital, which resulted in a decrease of $89,325. The plaintiff contests this deduction, arguing that only $10,000 of the dividend had been paid within the first sixty days of the taxable year, and the balance was paid at various times after that period.

The Commissioner's interpretation of the dividend resolution is supported by Article 858 of Regulations 45, which states that a dividend paid after the expiration of the first sixty days of the taxable year will be deemed to be paid out of the net income of the taxable year to the extent of the net income available for such purpose on the date when it is payable. This provision is in line with the principle established in Swift & Company v. United States, 196 U. S. 375, that a court should enforce an observance of the statute against a carrier who has been adjudged to have violated its provisions.

Furthermore, the plaintiff's contention that the dividend was not deductible until payment was actually made is not supported by the facts. The resolution declared a dividend payable in cash or notes bearing 5 per cent, interest, at the convenience of the company. On January 31, 1918, the company paid $8,000 by cash and credit, and issued interest-bearing demand notes to each stockholder, with one exception. This delivery of notes should be considered a payment of the dividend.

In conclusion, we hold that the Commissioner's determination of the amount of plaintiff's invested capital for the year 1918 is correct. The dividend declared by the resolution of January 25, 1918, was properly deducted from plaintiff's invested capital, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover the amount of $5,209.10 claimed. The court's ruling is in line with the principles established in Ohio & Miss. Ry. Co. v. McCarthy, 96 U. S. 258, and Swift & Company v. United States, 196 U. S. 375. The case is affirmed.

gold_text: Notice of this -contention of plaintiff is supererogation because our decision is not based upon payment of the dividend on January 31,1918. Our examination of the dividend resolution has satisfied us that the Commissioner was correct in his interpretation of it, and that the withdrawal of invested capital was properly declared as of January 25, 1918, pursuant to article 858 of Regulations 45. The validity of that regulation is not open to serious question, in our judgment. It was promulgated by authority of Congress, and since its publication it has set forth the interpretation and practice of the Treasury Department in respect to several sections of the act of 1918, and, as such, it is entitled to great consideration. This is true of any regulation adopted pursuant to an act which placed the duty of enforcement of it upon the department making the regulation; but this particular regulation is entitled to even greater weight than an ordinary one, because Congress has several times re-enacted the provisions of the sections of the act of 1918 which the regulation was designed to interpret, and, under such circumstances, it has the implied sanction of that body. This is an established rule of construction. See New Haven R. R. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 200 U. S. 361, 26 S. Ct. 272, 50 L. Ed. 515; Copper Queen v. Arizona, 206 U. S. 474, 27 S. Ct. 695, 51 L. Ed. 1143.
