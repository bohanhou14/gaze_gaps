The issue of whether the defendant was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel is raised. The defendant was convicted of bank robbery and claims that his counsel was ineffective in representing him. The court appointed counsel for the defendant on December 20, 1963, and they appeared on December 27. The indictment was returned on January 15, 1964.

The defendant claims that his counsel was ineffective because they were not present during the FBI's interrogation of the defendant on December 20, 1963, and January 24, 1964. However, the court found that the defendant's counsel was appointed on December 20, 1963, and their appearance was entered on December 27, 1963. This means that the defendant's counsel was present during the FBI's interrogation of the defendant on January 24, 1964.

In Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201 (1964), the Supreme Court held that a defendant's right to counsel is violated when the government interrogates the defendant after the defendant has retained counsel, without the presence of counsel. However, in this case, the defendant's counsel was present during the FBI's interrogation of the defendant on January 24, 1964. Therefore, the defendant's counsel was effective in representing the defendant.

The defendant also claims that his counsel was ineffective because they did not present any expert testimony on the issue of the defendant's sanity at the time of the crime. However, the court found that the defendant's counsel presented expert testimony on the issue of the defendant's sanity at the time of the crime. Dr. Glotfelty testified that the defendant was not insane at the time of the crime, and Dr. Waitzel testified that the defendant's tolerance for stress was low and that he may have been unable to control his actions at the time of the crime.

In Davis v. United States, 360 U.S. 315 (1960), the Supreme Court held that a defendant's counsel is not required to present expert testimony on the issue of the defendant's sanity at the time of the crime. Therefore, the defendant's counsel was not ineffective in not presenting expert testimony on the issue of the defendant's sanity at the time of the crime.

In conclusion, the defendant's claim that he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel is without merit. The defendant's counsel was present during the FBI's interrogation of the defendant on January 24,
