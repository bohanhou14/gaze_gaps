In this case, we are dealing with a prisoner who is seeking a federal writ of habeas corpus. The district court dismissed the application as untimely under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) one-year statute of limitations. The prisoner is arguing that the time period during which he awaited his trial transcript should be tolled.

In Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), the Supreme Court established the two-part test for ineffective assistance of counsel. The Court has also held that a prisoner is not entitled to statutory tolling if his motion for post-conviction relief is not properly filed under state law. See Allen v. Siebert, — U.S. —, 128 S.Ct. 2, 4, 169 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007).

In this case, the prisoner's motion for reconsideration of sentence was not timely filed under Louisiana law. The trial court did not deny the motion as untimely, but instead issued an order requiring the prisoner to refile the motion with a copy of his Boykin transcript attached. The prisoner failed to refile the motion, and instead filed a timely post-conviction relief application.

The prisoner is not entitled to statutory tolling because his motion was not properly filed under state law. Additionally, the prisoner failed to demonstrate that he faced "rare and exceptional" circumstances that prevented him from properly filing his motion. See Prieto v. Quarterman, 456 F.3d 511, 514 (5th Cir. 2006).

In conclusion, the prisoner's motion for federal post-conviction relief was not timely, and was properly denied with prejudice. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion, and its judgment is affirmed.

gold_text: . Both Gonzales and the state make arguments in their briefs that fall outside the scope of the COA. For example, Gonzales extensively briefed the merits of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In his brief, he also claims that his actions were not illegal because he lacked specific intent, that the weapons he used in the events at issue in his case were not his, and that he only used force in self defense. A COA is required to appeal the denial of a state prisoner's habeas application. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(A); Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1600, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). A COA shall issue "only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2). The COA “shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(3). If a district court partially grants a COA and certifies some, but not all, issues raised by an applicant in the district court, the applicant may move this court to extend the order granting a COA to issues that the district court refused to certify. United States v. Kimler, 150 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir. 1998). To move this court to extend the order granting a COA requires an “express request” from the applicant. Id. at 431 n. 1. Merely briefing issues outside the ambit of the COA does not satisfy this requirement. See id. at 431 & n. 1. Gonzales has not made such a request to expand his COA to include any of the additional issues raised in his brief. Because this court’s review is limited to the issue specified in the grant of COA, Gonzales's arguments outside the scope of the COA need not be considered, and we do not consider them. Lackey v. Johnson, 116 F.3d 149, 152 (5th Cir. 1997).
