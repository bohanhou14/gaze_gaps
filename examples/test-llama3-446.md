The case of Pearson v. Northeast Airlines, Inc., 307 F.2d 131 (2d Cir., 1962), is a landmark decision in the field of conflict of laws.

The court also held that a state may apply its own rule of liability to a particular issue in the litigation, even if the foreign state's rule is different.

The court relied on the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Article IV, Section 1, of the United States Constitution, which requires that a state give full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. The court stated that this clause does not require a state to apply the laws of another state in its entirety, but rather to give full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of another state, which may be different from the laws of the forum state.

The court also relied on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires that a state not deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The court stated that a state's application of its own rules of law to a cause of action arising from a foreign state does not deprive the defendant of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.

In conclusion, the case of Pearson v. Northeast Airlines, Inc., 307 F.2d 131 (2d Cir., 1962), is an important decision in the field of conflict of laws, and it establishes the principle that a state has the constitutional
