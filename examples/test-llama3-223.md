After reviewing the provided references, I will summarize the key points and provide a concise answer.

Reference case 76 F.3d 1446 is a notable case that discusses the requirements for a civil rights conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). The court holds that to prove the existence of a conspiracy, the plaintiff must show: (1) a conspiracy, (2) for the purpose of depriving someone of equal protection of the laws or equal privileges and immunities, (3) an act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (4) injury to the plaintiff.

In the case at hand, Davis alleges a civil rights conspiracy claim against the defendants. However, upon reviewing the facts, it is clear that Davis has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claim. The defendants have shown legitimate reasons for revoking Davis's medical privileges, including his behavior towards hospital staff, poor patient care, and failure to maintain proper medical records.

Davis also alleges race discrimination and retaliation claims, but the court has granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The court has found that Davis has failed to provide evidence giving rise to an inference of racial discrimination, and that the defendants have provided legitimate reasons for their actions.

In conclusion, the court has properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims, as Davis has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims of civil rights conspiracy, race discrimination, and retaliation.
