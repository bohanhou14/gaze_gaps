The necessity for meticulous compliance by the taxpayer with all named conditions in order to secure the benefit of the limitation was distinctly pointed out in Florsheim Bros. v. United States, 50 S. Ct. 297, 74 L. Ed. 829. Here, the plaintiff’s contention that verbal representations suffice is not legally tenable, as both cited cases emphasize the requirement for specific written protests. The Florsheim case unequivocally held that no officer has power to substitute something else for the conditions expressly prescribed. 

The judgments and reasoning in these cases are directly applicable here. The plaintiff’s reliance on oral representations to the collector falls short of constitutive legal protest. Analogous to the Maas & Waldstein Co. v. United States precedent (cf. 51 S. Ct. 606, 75 L. Ed. 1285), wherein written communications were deemed inadequate, the plaintiff's arguments and protests are insufficient under section 1324(a). Thus, irrespective of the sincerity of any oral statements made, they do not fulfill the statutory requirements for a specific protest, rendering the plaintiff ineligible for the claimed interest.

Based on the explicit requirements set forth in these critical reference cases, the plaintiff’s claim for interest from the date of payment must be denied, affirming the necessity for adherence to prescribed procedural mandates.
