In this context, appellants further argue that the trial was prejudiced by the jury's exposure to inadmissible evidence, drawing parallels to the circumstances addressed in 360 U.S. 310. In that case, the Supreme Court highlighted the prejudicial impact of jurors encountering extraneous information, underscoring that remedies such as instructions to disregard may not always mitigate the resulting bias. Similarly, the dying declaration discussed in 94 F.2d 90 demonstrates the potential for lasting juror bias despite judicial instructions to ignore such statements. These precedents underscore the appellants' contention that the prosecution's reference to the unsubstantiated heroin importation in the indictment and opening statement likely prejudiced the jury. The corrective measures taken by the trial judge, such as instructing the jury to disregard specific statements, are argued to be insufficient in fully neutralizing potential bias, mirroring concerns from the cited cases. Consequently, the cumulative effect of these errors, combined with the alleged insufficiencies in the evidence, forms the basis for challenging the convictions and seeking a more thorough judicial review. Based on these factors, we conclude that the appellants' arguments regarding jury prejudice and evidentiary support warrant careful reconsideration in line with established judicial standards.

Also, it is the general rule that error in the admission of evidence under most circumstances may be cured by withdrawing the evidence from the jury’s consideration and instructing the jury to disregard it. Holt v. United States, 94 F.2d 90 (10th Cir.). However, as an exception to the general rule, where the character of the testimony is such that it will create so strong an impression on the minds of the jurors that they will be unable to disregard it in their consideration of the case, although admonished to do so, a mistrial should be ordered. Holt v. United States, supra; Marshall v. United States, 360 U.S. 310, 79 S.Ct. 1171, 3 L.Ed.2d 1250 ; United States v. Jacangelo, 281 F.2d 574 (3d Cir.).”
