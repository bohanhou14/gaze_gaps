II. N.Y. Exec. Law Claims under 296(6)
Defendants argue that the individual defendants cannot be held liable for aiding and abetting in violation of N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(6). They claim that the only defendant who engaged in the allegedly discriminatory conduct cannot also be liable for aiding and abetting in that conduct. See Reid v. Ingerman Smith LLP, 876 F.Supp.2d 176, 186-187 (E.D.N.Y.2012).

However, in Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295, 1317 (2d Cir.1995), the court held that an individual can be held liable for aiding and abetting in violation of N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(6) if that individual "actually participates in the conduct giving rise to the discrimination claim." Id. at 1317.

In this case, Plaintiff has alleged that all of the individual defendants, including Cuttitta, participated in the discriminatory conduct that gave rise to her claims. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Cuttitta and the other individual defendants created a hostile work environment, assigned her to monitor the outside parking lot, denied her breaks and overtime opportunities, and retaliated against her for complaining about the discrimination.

Therefore, the court finds that Plaintiff has adequately pled a claim for aiding and abetting in violation of N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(6) against all of the individual defendants, including Cuttitta. See Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295, 1317 (2d Cir.1995).

For the reasons above, the court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss the claims against the individual defendants. The court will require Plaintiff to provide more specific and detailed allegations regarding the aiding and abetting conduct of each individual defendant.

gold_text: The facts of the case cited by Defendants do not apply here. It is possible for an individual to be liable under § 296(6) for “actually participating” in the discriminatory conduct even thought he or she lacks the authority to hire or fire the plaintiffs. See Feingold v. New York, 366 F.3d 138, 157-158 (2d Cir.2004), following Tomka, 66 F.3d at 1317. In the present case, Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that she complained to Cuttitta, that Cuttitta never addressed Plaintiffs complaints, ultimately gave her a negative performance evaluation and subsequently terminated Plaintiff. Accepting these allegations as true, the Court finds the Plaintiff sufficiently alleges a claim under the N.Y. Exec. Law and hereby denies Defendants’ motion to dismiss. See Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295, 1317 (2d Cir.1995), abrogated on other grounds by Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998).
