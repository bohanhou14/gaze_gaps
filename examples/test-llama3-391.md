The cases discussed in the reference articles, specifically 740 F.2d 160 and 701 F.2d 1238, provide valuable insights into the legal framework surrounding ERISA claims and the exhaustion of administrative remedies. In the context of the present case, it is crucial to analyze the trust agreements and collective bargaining agreements to determine the extent of the trustees' powers and duties.

The Supreme Court has consistently held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies is a requirement for federal court jurisdiction under ERISA. In Rosenthal v. Ann Service Corp., 571 F.Supp. 1229, 1232 (S.D.N.Y.1983), the court emphasized that prior fully considered actions by pension plan trustees interpreting their plans and perhaps also further refining and defining the problem in given cases, may well assist the courts when they are called upon to resolve the controversies.

In the instant case, the union-appointed trustees failed to pursue the arbitration procedure provided for in the trust agreements, contravening both the Taft-Hartley Act and the trust agreements. The district court correctly dismissed the suits for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The courts have consistently held that the exhaustion requirement is a matter of sound policy, favoring exhaustion of remedies in ERISA cases. See Schneider Moving & Storage Co. v. Robbins, — U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1844, 80 L.Ed.2d 366 (1984).

In conclusion, the cases cited above demonstrate the importance of exhausting administrative remedies before bringing a lawsuit under ERISA. The district court's dismissal of the suits is consistent with the Supreme Court's precedent and the exhaustion requirement as a matter of sound policy. The union-appointed trustees are required to follow the procedures outlined in the trust agreements, including arbitration, before seeking judicial relief.

gold_text: The plans involved in these suits have expressly provided a remedy for deadlock among the trustees on the question whether to sue under the trust agreements for contributions. Before pursuing judicial remedies, the trustees must comply with the arbitration procedures. See O’Hare v. General Marine Transport Corp., 740 F.2d 160, 168 (2d Cir.1984), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1181, 84 L.Ed.2d 329 (1985). Permitting the Union-appointed trustees to sue without first submitting the issue to arbitration would violate the firmly established federal policy favoring exhaustion of administrative remedies in ERISA cases. See Kross v. Western Electric Co., 701 F.2d 1238, 1244 (7th Cir.1983). Because the trustees have not exhausted their administrative remedies, their actions are premature and were properly dismissed.
