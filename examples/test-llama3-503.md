The legal case presented here involves a 17-year-old juvenile who was arrested for various narcotics offenses and the government's motion to transfer the case to adult jurisdiction. The court considered the six factors mandated by 18 U.S.C. § 5032, including the juvenile's age and social background, the nature of the alleged offense, the extent and nature of the juvenile's prior delinquency record, the juvenile's intellectual development and psychological maturity, the nature and success of past treatment efforts, and the availability of programs to treat the juvenile's behavioral problems.

The court weighed the factors and concluded that transfer to adult jurisdiction was not in the interest of justice. The court considered the seriousness of the offense, the juvenile's extensive criminal history, and the availability of treatment programs. The court also found that the juvenile's age and social background were factors that weighed in favor of juvenile adjudication.

This case is similar to United States v. C.G., 736 F.2d 1474, 1478-79 (11th Cir.1984), where the court considered the same factors and concluded that transfer to adult jurisdiction was not in the interest of justice. The court in that case also emphasized the importance of considering the juvenile's prior delinquency record and the availability of treatment programs.

In contrast, the court in United States v. Doe, 871 F.2d 1248, 1252 (5th Cir.1989), considered the same factors and concluded that transfer to adult jurisdiction was in the interest of justice. The court in that case emphasized the seriousness of the offense and the juvenile's age and social background.

In conclusion, the court's decision to deny the government's motion to transfer the case to adult jurisdiction was reasonable and justified based on the factors considered. The court's decision is similar to that in United States v. C.G., but differs from that in United States v. Doe. The court's consideration of the factors mandated by 18 U.S.C. § 5032 and the availability of treatment programs was crucial in determining the outcome of the case.

gold_text: In deciding whether to transfer an action, the district court must consider and make findings on the record with respect to the six statutory factors described above. See 18 U.S.C. § 5032. The district court is not required to afford equal weight to each factor, but instead may balance them as it deems appropriate. See United States v. Doe, 871 F.2d 1248, 1254-55 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 917, 110 S.Ct. 276, 107 L.Ed.2d 257 (1989); Alexander, 695 F.2d at 400-01. The district court must make factual findings sufficient to permit meaningful appellate review. See United States v. Romulus, 949 F.2d 713, 715-16 (4th Cir.1991), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 1690, 118 L.Ed.2d 403 (1992).
