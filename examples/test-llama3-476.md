MEMORANDUM OPINION

The court dismisses the plaintiff's declaratory judgment action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff, Mutual Pharmaceutical Company, seeks a declaratory judgment that its product does not infringe the patent of defendant Pfizer, a pioneer drug manufacturer. The court holds that the plaintiff has not demonstrated a reasonable apprehension of an infringement suit, as required by the Declaratory Judgment Act.

The court cites the Federal Circuit's precedent in Arrowhead, 846 F.2d at 736, 6 USPQ2d at 1689, that a declaratory judgment plaintiff must show that the patentee's words and actions were objective and placed the plaintiff in reasonable apprehension of suit. The court also references International Medical Prosthetics Research Assocs., Inc. v. Gore Enter. Holdings, Inc., 787 F.2d 572, 575, 229 USPQ 278, 281 (Fed. Cir. 1986), which requires an objective standard for assessing whether the patentee's words and actions instilled a reasonable apprehension in the declaratory plaintiff.

The court notes that the plaintiff's argument is similar to that in Super Products, 623 F.2d 1207, where the court held that a declaratory judgment plaintiff must show a real threat of infringement litigation by the patentee. The court also references Pittway Corp., 444 F.Supp. at 1213, which states that a declaratory judgment plaintiff cannot obtain relief when there is no real threat of infringement litigation by the patentee.

The court concludes that the plaintiff has not demonstrated a reasonable apprehension of an infringement suit, as required by the Declaratory Judgment Act. The court grants the defendant's motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment action. The court's decision is consistent with the Federal Circuit's precedent in Dupont Merck Pharm. Co. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 62 F.3d 1397, 1401 (Fed. Cir. 1995), which requires a declaratory judgment plaintiff to show a reasonable apprehension of an infringement suit.



citations: ['4 F.3d 975', '623 F.2d 1207']

gold_text: To begin with, the court recognizes that none of the plaintiffs three stated reasons creates a reasonable apprehension in and of itself. See, e.g., BP Chems. Ltd. v. Union Carbide Corp., 4 F.3d 975, 980 (Fed.Cir.1993) (stating that “[although a patentee’s refusal to give assurances that it will not enforce its patent is relevant to the determination, this factor is not dispos-itive”) (internal citation omitted); Int’l Harvester, Co. v. Deere, Co., 623 F.2d 1207, 1212 (7th Cir.1980) (concluding that the plaintiff did not establish a reasonable apprehension of suit even when other litigation was pending between the two parties); Premo Pharm. Labs. v. Pfizer Pharms., Inc., 465 F.Supp. 1281, 1283-84 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (holding that a history of litigiousness by the defendant does not, by itself, support a reasonable apprehension of suit). Of course, whether the totality of the circumstances, as opposed to each fact individually, causes a reasonable apprehension of suit is a closer call.
