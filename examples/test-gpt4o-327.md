Bapack challenges the district court’s application of the aggravating role enhancement under § 3B1.1(c) of the Guidelines, arguing insufficient evidence of her supervisory role over another participant in the crime. She asserts that mere management of an organization's activities, without supervision of individuals directly involved in the criminal activities, should not qualify for such enhancement. This argument aligns with the principle articulated in United States v. Gort-DiDonato, which clarifies that "control over a scheme rather than over a participant" is insufficient for § 3B1.1(c) enhancement (109 F.3d 318, 322 (6th Cir.1997)).

However, the Guidelines Commentary explicitly states that an upward departure is warranted if a defendant exercises management responsibility over the organization’s property, assets, or activities (§ 3Bl.1(e), comment., n. 2; see also 111 F.3d 21). This interpretation is consistent with established case law, which confirms that such management can suffice for an enhancement under the Guidelines, even if direct supervision of another participant is not demonstrated (see United States v. Ronning, 47 F.3d at 711).

Furthermore, in cases like United States v. Novoa, the court vacated the adjustment precisely because no evidence supported supervision or management of codefendants (101 F.3d 1046). In contrast, here, substantial testimonial evidence indicated that Bapack directed nurses to falsify records knowingly, thereby exercising significant control and management within the fraudulent scheme. This aligns with the justification for the managerial role enhancement under § 3B1.1(c), as affirmed by applicable precedents.

For these reasons, we conclude the district court did not err in applying the enhancement and affirm the sentence's cumulative application under sections 3Bl.1(c) and 2F1.1(b)(2)(A) (more than minimal planning). The district court’s judgment regarding Bapack’s restitution payment also reflects proper consideration of her financial status, thus affirming that order as well.

gold_text: . The Commentary recites that "[a]n upward departure may be warranted, however, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead, manage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.” Guidelines Manual, § 3B1.1 application note 2. Because the district court indicated that it was adjusting Bapack's sentence, rather than upwardly departing, however, we cannot affirm the sentence on the basis of her evident role 'in exercising "management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of” the Corporation. See United States v. Jobe, 101 F.3d 1046, 1048 (5th Cir.1996) ("As the district court did not order an upward departure, this ground of enhancement is unavailable to sustain the enhancement on appeal.''), cert. denied - U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 81, - L.Ed.2d - (1997); but cf. United States v. Giraldo, 111 F.3d 21, 24 (5th Cir.1997) (although sentencing judge improperly relied on asset management theory to adjust sentence instead of upwardly departing, court declined to vacate sentence because evidence also supported adjustment making Guidelines application error harmless).
