**Generation:**

Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the plaintiffs' claims against the Secretary of the Interior and the involved utilities are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The precedent cases reinforce this position. For instance, Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp. unequivocally holds that the relief sought when addressing the sovereign is fundamentally relief against the sovereign itself (Larson, 337 U.S. at 689). Furthermore, the Administrative Procedure Act does not confer jurisdiction where agency actions are discretionary (370 F.2d 529), and actions committed to agency discretion by law are not subject to judicial review (417 F.2d 1310). The inconsistency of attempting to litigate exchanges made by the Secretary of the Interior without Congress's consent is further supported by Chournos v. United States (335 F.2d 918) and Ove Gustavsson Contr. Co. v. Floete (278 F.2d 912), which both reject using the APA to overcome sovereign immunity.

Thus, the motions to dismiss by the Secretary and the utility companies were appropriately granted based on sovereign immunity and the non-reviewability of the Secretary's discretionary actions under the APA. The District Court's decision is hereby affirmed, aligning with the established legal precedents as aforementioned.

We affirm the District Court's dismissal of the amended complaint.
