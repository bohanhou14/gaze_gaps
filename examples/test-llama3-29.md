The petitioner claimed a deduction for a contribution to a profit-sharing trust in 1953. The respondent disallowed the deduction, citing that the trust was not tax-exempt until 1955. The petitioner argues that the contribution was properly accrued in 1953, as the plan was ratified by the employees and stockholders in that year.

Reference case 27 T.C. 372 supports the petitioner's argument, stating that a payment on account of a taxable year and made within 60 days after the close of the taxable year is treated as if it had been made during the year of accrual. In this case, the payment was made within 60 days of the close of the taxable year, and the plan was ratified by the employees and stockholders in 1953. Therefore, the contribution should be considered as a deduction in 1953.

However, the respondent cites reference case 269 U.S. 422, which states that a profit-sharing plan must be free from any conditions that would prevent the benefits from being shared by all employees. The plan in question was discriminatory, as it gave additional units to certain employees. Therefore, the trust was not tax-exempt in 1953, and the deduction should be disallowed.

In conclusion, while the petitioner's argument is supported by reference case 27 T.C. 372, the disallowance of the deduction is supported by reference case 269 U.S. 422. Therefore, the respondent's determination is sustained. The contribution to the profit-sharing trust in 1953 should be disallowed as a deduction.

gold_text: By the very terms of the stockholders’ resolution and the terms of the trust instrument, the effective date of the trust was January 1, 1954. Petitioner does argue that, even though the effective date of the trust was January 1, 1954, the controlling date is the date in which the plan was adopted, citing Tollman Tool & Machine Corporation, 27 T.C. 372 (1956). In that case, as well as in Crow-Burlingame Co., 15 T.C. 738 (1950), dealing with a similar problem, the effective dates of the trusts were the same as the dates in which the resolutions were adopted creating the trusts. Eespondent had argued unsuccessfully in Tollman Tool & Machine Corporation and Crow-Burlingame Co., both supra, that no trust could exist until moneys were in fact paid into it thereby creating the trust reserve. We held that the expressed intention of the stockholders and the board of directors controlled the existence of the trusts. In the instant case, however, petitioner’s stockholders expressly stated that the effective date of the trust was to be January 1, 1954. Petitioner had incurred no liability which could properly be accrued on December 31, 1953, or which could be enforced by the employees at any time during 1953; nor did the employees’ rights under the trust become fixed prior to January 1, 1954. All events must occur which fix the amount of the expense and determine the liability of the taxpayer to pay it before an expense item may accrue. United States v. Anderson, 269 U.S. 422 (1926).
