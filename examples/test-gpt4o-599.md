In analyzing the plaintiff's claims and defenses, we must consider pertinent case law. For instance, in Rosenberg v. Hano, it was adjudicated that misrepresentation about stock arrangements does not inherently exempt a complainant from due diligence obligations in timely litigation (121 F.2d 818). Similarly, in Du Pont v. Du Pont, the court observed that agency relations and misuse of fiduciary positions are essential to establish grounds for recovery (256 F. 129). The time limits imposed by statutes, particularly within the Securities Exchange Act, must also be strictly observed, as emphasized in Chase Securities Co. v. Donaldson, where adherence to limitations was upheld despite potential fairness issues (325 U.S. 304). Furthermore, Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp. addresses the necessity of prohibitions unlinked to the fairness of specific transactions to effectively manage subtle questions of insider influence (318 U.S. 80).

In cases involving statutes of limitations tied explicitly to the right to action, as clarified in Pennsylvania Co. for Insurance v. Deckert, tolling due to fraud or concealment is often non-applicable unless explicitly legislated (123 F.2d 979). Consequently, considering these precedents, we observe that despite potential equities favoring the plaintiff, statutory language and timeliness criteria as expressed in Falco v. Donner Foundation dictate that summary dismissals may be warranted absent sufficient pleadings or objective delays (208 F.2d 600).

Therefore, absent an amendment within twenty days or new assertions by affidavit addressing timing and diligence in discovering the cause of action, defendant’s motion to dismiss is substantively grounded.
