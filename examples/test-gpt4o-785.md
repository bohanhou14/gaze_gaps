Gant argues that the district court erred in not resubmitting the inconsistent jury verdict for further deliberation. However, Gant waived the right to contest this issue on appeal by failing to object prior to the discharge of the jury. As established in Stancill v. McKenzie Tank Lines, Inc., 497 F.2d 529, 534-35 (5th Cir. 1974), objections to inconsistencies must be raised at the time the verdict is rendered. Furthermore, resubmission to the jury to resolve incoherent responses has been noted as preferable practice (671 F.2d 946). 

Additionally, special verdicts governed by Rule 49(a) do not necessitate pre-discharge objections to preserve appellate review of verdict inconsistencies, as clarified in Mercer v. Long Mfg. N. C., 823 F.2d 1366, and supported by Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc. v. Crown Life Ins. Co., 734 F.2d 133, 144-45 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1072 (1984). Therefore, Gant's failure to timely object to the form of the special verdict under Rule 49(a) bars this appellate contention.

Given these procedural shortcomings, the district court's ruling stands, and we find no merit in Gant's arguments. Consequently, we affirm the district court's judgment.

AFFIRMED.

gold_text: Even if construed as a challenge to the verdict’s consistency, however, Gant’s appeal is waived. In this circuit, all challenges to the consistency of special verdicts must be raised before the jury is excused. ITEL Capital Corp. v. Cups Coal Co., Inc., 707 F.2d 1253, 1261 (11th Cir.1983) ("[Ajppellants waived their objection to alleged inconsistencies in the jury’s answers to the special interrogatories [propounded pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(a) ] by failing to object at the time the verdict was rendered.”); Stancill v. McKenzie Tank Lines, Inc., 497 F.2d 529, 534 (5th Cir.1974) (same; Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b)). But see Pierce v. Southern Pacific Trans. Co., 823 F.2d 1366, 1370 (9th Cir.1987) (failure to object constitutes waiver only under Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b) and not under 49(a)); Mercer v. Long Mfg. N.C., Inc., 671 F.2d 946, 947-48 (5th Cir. Unit A 1982) (same). As the proper remedy for an inconsistent verdict is resubmission of the case to the jury, Gant's rejection of Judge Castagna’s offer to do so constitutes waiver of any later challenge to the consistency of the verdict.
