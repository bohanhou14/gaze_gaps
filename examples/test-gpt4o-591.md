In light of the precedent cases referenced, it is pertinent to consider **Finn v. Consolidated Rail Corp.**, 622 F.Supp. 41 (D.Mass.1985), aff'd, 823 F.2d 693 (1st Cir.1987), where the court similarly dismissed claims involving the lack of a direct, physical injury under FELA. In **Moody v. Maine Central R.R. Co.**, 620 F.Supp. 1472 (D.Maine 1985), aff'd, 823 F.2d 693 (1st Cir.1987), the courts reaffirmed that emotional distress claims without physical impact or accident do not suffice under FELA. Additionally, in **Adkins v. Seaboard System R.R.**, 821 F.2d 340 (6th Cir.1987), liability was denied for emotional distress without physical injury, reinforcing that such claims necessitate a more concrete form of harm.

Moreover, in **Balascsak v. United States**, 873 F.2d 673 (3d Cir.1989), it was shown that legal assessments prioritize clear, temporal, and jurisdictional connections in determining liability and damages, indicating meticulous scrutiny is required for claims.

Thus, applying these principles to the present case, it remains clear that Holliday's situation does not meet the stringent criteria set forth by precedent for emotional distress claims under FELA, necessitating a dismissal of his claims. The case specifics aligned with the precedents establish that his claim, lacking direct physical impact or a significant causative accident, does not warrant recovery.

gold_text: We, along with the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, “discern from the Buell opinion an attempt to leave the door to recovery for wholly emotional injury somewhat ajar but not by any means wide open.” Moody v. Maine Central R.R. Co., 823 F.2d 693, 694 (1987). We are encouraged to reach our result by the realization that if we hold that a railroad employee demonstrating some possible negligence with psychological consequences will always present a jury question in a FELA action, the most attenuated claims could be advanced. Indeed, a routine management decision not resulting in an accident could give rise to a claim by an employee for psychological injuries. We think that we must determine whether there may be a recovery, as the Supreme Court indicated in Buell, on the baáis of the facts in the particular case being considered and that is what we have done. While a bright line is always cherished by judges and attorneys, the fact is that in some situations, as Judge Becker noted in a very different context in United States v. Balascsak, 873 F.2d 673, 685 (3d Cir.1989) (concurring opinion), “developing the law on a case-by-case basis and drawing lines depending on the facts is the stuff of judging_” We have developed the law in this case on that basis and the line we draw will not allow recovery.
