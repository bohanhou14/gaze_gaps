The district court’s decision to use the otherwise applicable offense level rather than the offense level specified by the career offender guideline aligns with established precedent. According to U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, if the offense level derived from the career offender table is lower than the otherwise applicable offense level, the higher offense level should apply. This principle has been consistently upheld in multiple circuits. For instance, in United States v. Gay, 240 F.3d 1222, the Tenth Circuit affirmed that § 4B1.1's primary intent is sentence enhancement and not reduction, a view supported by the Third Circuit in United States v. Marrone, 48 F.3d 735. The Seventh Circuit in United States v. Robinson, 935 F.2d 201, also confirmed that the greater offense level must apply, reaffirming that the career offender guideline is intended to impose substantial imprisonment terms (see also United States v. Linnear, 40 F.3d 215).

Moreover, the First Circuit in United States v. Elwell, 984 F.2d 1289, stressed that career offender enhancements align with legislative intent to punish recidivism more severely, a position echoed in United States v. Belton, 890 F.2d 9. This approach ensures that repeat offenders receive sentences at or near the statutory maximum, consistent with Congress’ intent, as elucidated by the Second Circuit in United States v. Blake, 59 F.3d 138.

Therefore, the district court correctly applied the higher offense level of 40, ensuring Brooks’ sentence adhered to both the spirit and letter of the guideline provisions and pertinent case law interpretation (see United States v. Unthank, 109 F.3d 1205 as referenced in 144 F.3d 1024; United States v. Zimmer, 299 F.3d 710).

gold_text: Brooks’ argument ignores the plain language of the career offender guideline. Section 4B1.1 directs the court to employ the offense level specified in the career offender table if that level is greater than the otherwise applicable offense level. That condition is not satisfied in this case-the level specified in section 4Bl.l’s table is not greater than the otherwise applicable level. Therefore, by its own terms, section 4Bl.l(b) does not apply, and the court returns to the default, otherwise applicable offense level. Nothing in section 4B1.1 suggests that the court may ignore the condition and apply the offense level specified in its table even if it is lower than the offense level otherwise applicable. Indeed, doing so would defy the very purpose behind section 4B1.1 and the congressional mandate that it purports to implement, which is to ensure that persons who qualify as career offenders receive more severe prison terms that are as close to the statutory maximum as possible. Given the plain language and the evident intent of the career offender guideline, it comes as no surprise that we and other courts have uniformly rejected the reading of the guideline that Brooks advances. See United States v. Ward, 144 F.3d 1024, 1036 & n. 7 (7th Cir.1998); United States v. Linnear, 40 F.3d 215, 218 n. 1 (7th Cir.1994); see also United States v. Ventura, 353 F.3d 84, 90-91 (1st Cir.2003); United States v. Zimmer, 299 F.3d 710, 721 (8th Cir.2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1146, 123 S.Ct. 952, 154 L.Ed.2d 848 (2003); United States v. Gay, 240 F.3d 1222, 1231 (10th Cir.2001); United States v. Marrone, 48 F.3d 735, 740 n. 9 (3d Cir.1995); United States v. Robinson, 935 F.2d 201, 205-06 (11th Cir.1991). We therefore conclude that the district court properly employed the otherwise applicable offense level rather than the lower level specified in section 4Bl.l(b)(A).
