**Generation:**

Like the cases in AT&T v. INC, 972 F.2d 1321, and Uroplasty, Inc. v. Advanced Uroscience, Inc., 239 F.3d 1277, Plaintiffs' claims in the present case are grounded in state law and do not inherently require resolution of substantial patent law questions. Plaintiffs' tortious interference claim, similar to allegations in 109 F.3d 1567, stems from contract wrongs rather than direct questions of patent validity or infringement. In reference to 823 F.2d 527, the mere presence of patent issues in the context of state-law based claims does not convert such claims into those "arising under" federal patent laws. Therefore, as the well-pleaded complaint rule applies here, Plaintiffs' state law claims do not satisfy the requirements to invoke jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a).

gold_text: In Uroplasty and AT & T, the plaintiffs raised contract and misappropriation claims that implicated U.S. patents, yet we found that resolution of those state law claims were not sufficient to establish jurisdiction under section 1338(a). In the case at hand, the state law claims raised by Plaintiffs are one step farther removed in that they implicate the validity not of a U.S. patent, but of a patent issued under Japanese law. The fact that UT owns a U.S. patent on the invention allegedly misappropriated may be evidence of its claims, but the presence of the patent does not require resolution of a substantial question of U.S. patent law. See Jim Arnold Corp. v. Hydrotech Sys., Inc., 109 F.3d 1567, 1574 (Fed.Cir.1997) (holding that a complaint alleging breach of a patent assignment and royalty agreement does not state a claim arising under the patent laws even though a consequence of finding such a breach may lead to allegations of infringement); Speedco, 853 F.2d at 913 (holding that “the fact that patent issues are relevant under state contract law to the resolution of a contract dispute cannot possibly convert a suit for breach of contract into one ‘arising under’ the patent laws as required to render the jurisdiction of the district court based on section 1338.” (internal citation omitted)); Consol. World Housewares, 831 F.2d at 265 (“the mere presence of a patent issue cannot of itself create a cause of action arising under the patent laws”); Ballard Med. Prod. v. Wright, 823 F.2d 527, 531 (Fed.Cir.1987) (same).
