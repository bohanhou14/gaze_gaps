The validity of a warrantless search hinges on whether exigent circumstances exist. In 387 U.S. 294, the Supreme Court recognized that police can make a warrantless entry and search when the exigencies of the situation make that course imperative. This principle aligns with our case where the agents faced a genuine threat of evidence destruction.

Moreover, 333 U.S. 10 emphasizes that mere inconvenience is insufficient for bypassing the need for a warrant and underscores that a search of permanent premises typically requires one, unless there's a clear immediate threat.

The facts in 399 U.S. 30 further illuminate this principle. There, the Court held that unless there was an imminent threat to the evidence or the suspect's flight, the warrantless search lacked justification. Our case diverges, as the agents observed a real and immediate attempt to destroy evidence, justifying their immediate entry.

Additionally, 474 F.2d 262 supports our position by recognizing instances where the threat of evidence destruction allows for warrantless searches, provided the threat is imminent, as was clear from the fire in the carport.

Finally, 524 F.2d 779 reinforces the idea that exigent circumstances, like the imminent destruction of contraband, justified the lack of a warrant, aligning with our case's context and agent observations.

In conclusion, based on the totality of circumstances and pertinent case law, the warrantless entry and subsequent search were justified due to the immediate risk of evidence destruction.
