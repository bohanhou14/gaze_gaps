In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, the sentencing court must consider the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range. As stated in Gall, 128 S.Ct. 586, an abuse of discretion standard of review involves two steps: the first examines the sentence for significant procedural errors, and the second looks at the substance of the sentence. The Court in Gall explained that significant procedural errors include errors such as failing to calculate the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence, including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range. 

In the case at hand, Mack argues that the district court erred in denying his motions to suppress an eyewitness identification and statements he made during custodial interrogation. However, upon reviewing the evidence, we find that the district court did not err in permitting the identification testimony as reliable, taking into account the factors such as the witness's opportunity to view the suspect at the time of the crime, the witness's degree of attention at the time, the accuracy of the witness's initial description of the suspect, the witness's level of certainty in making the identification, and the length of time between the crime and the identification. 

Furthermore, we hold that the district court did not err in admitting the statements Mack made during custodial interrogation, as the Government showed that law enforcement officers adequately informed Mack of his rights under Miranda and obtained a waiver of those rights. The waiver was only valid if Mack waived his rights knowingly and voluntarily, and the district court properly credited the officers' testimony and weighed the presence of Mack's initials and signature on the waiver form in finding the evidence insufficient to show that Mack lacked the capacity to understand the waiver. 

Finally, we review the sentence for plain error, taking into account the relevant § 3553(a) factors and the district court's explanation for the chosen sentence. We find that the district court did not err in imposing the sentence, as it made an individualized assessment based on the facts presented and provided a reasoned basis for its decision. 

In conclusion, we affirm the district court's denial of Mack's motions to suppress and the imposition of his sentence, as the district court did not err in permitting the identification testimony as reliable, admitting the statements Mack made during custodial interrogation, and imposing the sentence.

gold_text: If there are no procedural errors, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. United States v. Pauley, 511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). “If the district court decides to impose a sentence outside the Guidelines range, it must ensure that its justification supports the degree of the variance.” United States v. Evans, 526 F.3d 155, 161 (4th Cir.2008). While we may presume that a sentence within the Guidelines range is reasonable, we may not presume that a sentence outside the Guidelines range is unreasonable. Gall, 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.
