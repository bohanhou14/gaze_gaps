Under the principles of statutory construction applicable in Indian law, Canons of Construction, the Court must construe liberally in favor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit. In the case, the Court must consider the Oneida County v. Oneida Indian Nation, 470 U.S. 226, 247 (1985), and Oneida County v. Oneida Indian Nation, 471 U.S. 759 (1985), which emphasized the importance of considering the unique trust relationship between the United States and the Indians.

In this case, the Court finds that the statutory condition, 25 U.S.C. § 1631(b)(1), is ambiguous and requires interpretation. The Court must also consider the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1682, which authorized the construction and renovation of health care facilities, including the Wagner IHS Health Care Facility. The Court notes that the statute required the Secretary to consult with Indian tribes and to assure that the facility, not later than one year after its construction or renovation, shall meet the standards of the Joint Committee on Accreditation of Hospitals.

Therefore, the Court holds that the IHS decision to renovate the Wagner IHS Health Care Facility, resulting in the elimination of inpatient medical services and threatened termination of 24-hour emergency room services, is subject to judicial review. The Court relies on the principles of statutory construction and the unique trust relationship between the United States and the Indians to construe the statute in favor of the Indians.

In conclusion, the Court finds that the IHS decision to renovate the Wagner IHS Health Care Facility is subject to judicial review under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702. The Court also finds that the statutory condition, 25 U.S.C. § 1631(b)(1), is ambiguous and requires interpretation in favor of the Indians. The Court relies on the principles of statutory construction and the unique trust relationship between the United States and the Indians to construe the statute in favor of the Indians.
