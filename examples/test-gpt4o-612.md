Nissan further argues that the prolonged state court proceedings will result in an impermissible delay, chilling its constitutional rights, particularly under the Contract Clauses of the Texas and federal Constitutions. This argument finds support in legal precedent where federal courts have noted the detrimental effect of abstention leading to delays in protecting federal rights. In McNeese v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 668, it was emphasized that “[w]e would defeat [the purposes of the Civil Rights Act] if we held that assertion of a federal claim in a federal court must await an attempt to vindicate the same claim in a state court.” (389 U.S. 241).

Furthermore, in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U. S. 288, 341 (Brandeis, J., concurring), it was highlighted that abstention often leads to piecemeal adjudication and undue delay in resolving constitutional issues, which is both costly and inefficient, especially when fundamental rights are at stake (377 U.S. 360).

Section 5.02(13) claims touch upon both settled and unsettled points of Texas statutory construction law, creating ambiguity that warrants state court clarification. Therefore, using the logic from O’Hair v. White, it is evident that even when an alternative state forum is necessary, the availability of such does not automatically justify abstention if the resolution of federal rights might be excessively delayed or the plaintiff might be forced to endure piecemeal litigation and uncertain relief (675 F.2d 680).

Ultimately, while the presence of these unsettled state law questions justifies the district court’s abstention, the potential for undue delay in state proceedings cannot be overlooked and must be carefully balanced against the need to protect Nissan’s federal rights without unnecessary delay.

gold_text: Nissan’s claim of undue delay is an appropriate claim, but not a persuasive one. The kind of delay that argues against abstention is delay that might significantly impair constitutional rights, see Redish, supra at 236; Field, Abstention in Constitutional Cases: The Scope of the Pullman Abstention Doctrine, 122 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1071, 1129-34 (1974), for example, where lengthy state proceedings will chill first amendment rights, Zwickler v.
