The case at hand raises questions about whether the actions of the police officer, Hogan, constituted a tacit arrest and whether he was acting under color of state law. The court must consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident to make a determination.

In the case of Chapman v. Higbee Co., 319 F.3d 825, the court held that a reasonable jury could find that the initiation of a strip search by an armed, uniformed sheriff's deputy constituted an act that may fairly be attributed to the state. Similarly, in this case, Hogan was a police officer on duty, wearing a uniform and badge, when he approached Barkovic in the courthouse hallway. While Hogan did not explicitly threaten to arrest Barkovic, his actions and presence in his official capacity could be seen as creating a reasonable expectation that Barkovic was not free to leave.

Moreover, the fact that Hogan was involved in previous cases with Barkovic and had a history of conflict with him may suggest that Hogan's actions were motivated by a desire to punish or intimidate Barkovic rather than simply to protect himself. This raises questions about whether Hogan was acting under color of state law, as defined in cases such as West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, and Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167.

In conclusion, the district court's grant of summary judgment may be reversed, and the case should be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. A jury determination is necessary to resolve the issues of fact and to determine whether Hogan's actions constituted a tacit arrest and whether he was acting under color of state law.

gold_text: Chapman v. Higbee Co. presented a genuine issue of material fact as to wheth er a security officer acted under color of state law. 319 F.3d 825, 835 (6th Cir.2003). In Chapman, a Dillard’s security guard, who was an off-duty sheriffs deputy, wearing his official uniform, badge, and sidearm, stopped and searched the plaintiff. Id. at 834. The officer did not represent himself as a police officer or threaten to arrest the plaintiff, but he did initiate a strip search, which, according to Dillard’s policy, required the intervention of police. Id. at 835. Thus, this court, describing the “color of state law” inquiry as “fact-specific” and determined on “a case-by-case basis,” held that “a reasonable jury could very well find that the initiation of a strip search by an armed, uniformed sheriffs deputy constituted an act that may fairly be attributed to the state.” Id. at 834-35 (citing Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961)). In turn, this court determined that summary judgment was inappropriate and remanded the case. Id. at 835.
