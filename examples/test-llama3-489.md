In the reference cases, it is established that a court of equity will set aside or annul a judgment or decree for fraud where the fraud is extrinsic or collateral to the matter tried by the first court. (United States v. Throckmorton, 98 U. S. 61, 65, 66; Vance v. Burbank, 101 U. S. 514, 519; Steel v. Smelting Co., 106 U. S. 447, 453; Moffat v. United States, 112 U. S. 24, 32; United States v. Minor, 114 U. S. 233, 242)

In the case at hand, it is clear that the patents issued to Chester Hawkins were void. Chester Hawkins died before April 1, 1899, making him a myth as far as being an applicant for a patent to the land in controversy. (Moffat v. United States, 112 U. S. 31, 5 Sup. Ct. 14, 28 L. Ed. 623)

As a result, the doctrine of a bona fide purchaser without notice does not apply in this case. (Tiffany’s Real Property, § 380 (Ed. 1903); Jones’ Law of Real Property, § 223; Hunter v. Watson, 12 Cal. 363, 73 Am. Dec. 543)

In conclusion, the patents issued to Chester Hawkins were void, and the doctrine of a bona fide purchaser without notice does not apply in this case. (54 L. Ed. 590)

gold_text: It is urged, also, in the present case, that the United States cannot cancel the patents in question because the fraud alleged was not extrinsic to the matter tried at the hearing before the Commission. To support this position the following cases are cited: Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U. S. 113, 16 Sup. Ct. 139, 40 L. Ed. 95; United States v. Throckmorton, 98 U. S. 61, 65, 66, 25 L. Ed. 93; Vance v. Burbank, 101 U. S. 514, 519, 25 L. Ed. 929; Steel v. St. Louis Smelt. & Ref. Co., 106 U. S. 447, 453, 1 Sup. Ct. 389, 27 L. Ed. 226; Moffat v. United States, 112 U. S. 24, 32, 5 Sup. Ct. 10, 28 L. Ed. 623; United States v. Minor, 114 U. S. 233, 242, 5 Sup. Ct. 826, 29 L. Ed. 110, But the Supreme Court has often held that the rule above announced is not applicable to ex parte proceedings in the United States Land Office, and that the finding of the land officers in such proceedings, although not open to collateral attack, is not conclusive against the government, when it sues to cancel the resulting patent upon the ground that it was obtained by means of false and fraudulent proofs. United States v. Minor, 114 U. S. 233, 5 Sup. Ct. 826, 29 L. Ed. 110; Mc-Caskill Co. v. United States, 216 U. S. 504, 30 Sup. Ct. 386, 54 L. Ed. 590; Washington Securities Co. v. United States, 234 U. S. 76, 34 Sup. Ct. 725, 58 L. Ed. 1220. In the case last cited it was said that:
