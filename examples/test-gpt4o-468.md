Cone further contends that failing to include specific information about the promises made to Hollrah and his drafting reluctance substantially undermines the truthfulness of the affidavit, citing the materiality standard in 793 F.2d 957. However, the omission of these facts does not reach the level of misleading necessary to invalidate the warrant, as detailed in United States v. Tyler, 238 F.3d 1036, and Reivich, 793 F.2d 957. The materiality threshold requires omissions to be sufficiently significant to mislead the issuing magistrate into an incorrect probable cause determination, which was not met in this case.

Moreover, precedent in 403 U.S. 573 establishes that the informant's identity or detailed terms of cooperation are not essential for the magistrate's probable cause assessment if their statements are corroborated by other evidence. The magistrate could reasonably consider the totality of circumstances, including Zane's prior observations of the van at Cone's residence, further supporting probable cause even without the omitted details.

Given these principles, the district court did not err in determining that a supplemented affidavit still supported probable cause, aligning with the flexible, comprehensive approach endorsed in Gates, 462 U.S. 213, and reinforced by the evaluative standards in 358 F.3d 987. Consequently, there was no abuse of discretion in denying Cone’s motion for a Franks hearing.

gold_text: That the affidavit omitted the promise of favorable treatment for Avery did not obscure a defect in the officer’s probable-cause submission. Informants may be motivated to lie when charges are pending against them, United States v. Ketzeback, 358 F.3d 987, 991 (8th Cir.2004), and we may assume that the prospect of charges against the child of an informant could have a similar effect. But we have “repeatedly rejected any blanket conclusion” that pending charges or cooperation with investigators make an informant’s statements “so suspect that it necessarily viti ates probable cause.” Id. The magistrate was informed that Hollrah received favorable consideration for his cooperation against Cone, and additional information about consideration for Avery would have been largely cumulative. That Hollrah was reluctant to include his admission about seeing additional marijuana at Cone’s home also does not fatally undermine the credibility of the submission, for Hollrah hesitated because he was concerned about implicating himself in additional criminal activity. Statements against interest typically support an inference of reliability, United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 583, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971); United States v. Reivich, 793 F.2d 957, 959 (8th Cir.1986), so Hollrah’s reticence under the circumstances suggests reliability. Nor does Zane’s writing of the affidavit weaken its substance, especially given video evidence that Zane accepted Hollrah’s direction and made corrections when requested.
