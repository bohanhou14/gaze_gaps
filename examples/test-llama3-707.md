Based on the case, we can conclude that Divers, as the President, sole officer, and director of J.R.D., exercised control over the disposition of plan assets, rendering him a fiduciary under ERISA (51 F.3d 1449). The court found that Divers had both formal and practical authority within J.R.D. to direct that the December 1996 through March 1997 contributions be paid to the Trust Funds (21).

As a fiduciary, Divers had a duty to act solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to them (29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A)). By choosing not to pay the required contributions to the Trust Funds, Divers breached his fiduciary duty (68 F.3d 1131).

Furthermore, the court found that the unpaid employer contributions were assets under ERISA (126 F.3d 34). As a fiduciary, Divers had a duty to manage and control the assets in accordance with the terms of the plan and for the exclusive benefit of the participants and beneficiaries (29 C.F.R. § 2509.75-5).

In conclusion, Divers' actions constituted a breach of his fiduciary duty under ERISA. He is liable for the unpaid employer contributions and liquidated damages. The court's findings are supported by the cases of Yeseta v. Baima (837 F.2d 380) and Lopresti v. Terwilliger (126 F.3d 34), which establish that a person who exercises control over the disposition of plan assets is a fiduciary under ERISA.

gold_text: Divers’ status as a corporate officer does not exempt him from liability. See Kayes v. Pacific Lumber Co., 51 F.3d 1449, 1459 (9th Cir.1995) (“This court has held corporate officers to be liable as fiduciaries on the basis of their conduct and authority with respect to ERISA plans.”). Rather, he is liable because, as established by the factual findings, he exercised authority and control over the management and disposition of the Trust Funds’ assets. See Parker v. Bain, 68 F.3d 1131, 1140 (9th Cir.1995) (finding individual who was company Vice President and majority owner to be a fiduciary because he ordered employees to withdraw plan assets to deposit into the corporation’s general account); Yeseta v. Baima, 837 F.2d 380, 386 (9th Cir.1988) (holding that employee who helped manage the business was a fiduciary under ERISA because he withdrew plan assets and placed them in the company’s account to cover “necessary operating expenses”); Lopresti v. Terwilliger, 126 F.3d 34, 40 (2nd Cir.1997) (holding that individual who paid company creditors instead of forwarding assets to the trust funds was a fiduciary); Connors v. Pay bra Mining Co., 807 F.Supp. 1242, 1246 (S.D.W.Va.1992) (concluding that company officers and directors were fiduciaries because they made “personal, conscious choices” to use withheld employee contributions to pay company expenses); PMTA-ILA Containerization Fund v. Rose, No. 94-5636, 1995 WL 461269, *5 (E.D.Pa. Aug.2, 1995) (“Courts have consistently held that employers who exercise discretionary control over funds that are designated for deposit into an ERISA fund qualify as fiduciaries.”).
