In the case of United States v. Gallagher, the court-martial had jurisdiction over the accused soldier, despite the offense being committed in a foreign country. The court cited the NATO Status of Forces Agreement and the Supplementary Agreement, which granted jurisdiction to the receiving state in cases of concurrent jurisdiction. The court also noted that the United States can constitutionally waive jurisdiction over its servicemen in foreign countries under such agreements, citing Wilson v. Girard, 354 U.S. 524 (1957).

Regarding the alleged denial of representation by counsel, the court found that the defense counsel, Captain Sullivan, had properly represented the accused soldier. The court noted that the defense counsel had interviewed several witnesses and had a thorough understanding of the case, and that the accused soldier had been given a fair trial.

The court also addressed the issue of whether the defense counsel had a conflict of interest in defending the accused soldier, given that he was also defending the other accused soldier, Hughes. The court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the defense counsel had a conflict of interest, and that he had properly represented both soldiers.

In conclusion, the court-martial had jurisdiction over the accused soldier, and the defense counsel had properly represented him.

gold_text: One thing we may be sure of: if Captain Sullivan (as counsel for Gallagher alone) had done what it is now said he should have, and if it had turned out badly, the outcry against Captain Sullivan would have been equally as great as it now is. The whole setup seems unfortunate and well calculated to assure that assigned defense counsel will never dare take the bold and imaginative steps by which paid defense counsel so often achieve the effects they do. We assume that denying an accused soldier the right to counsel denies him a constitutional right. Shapiro v. United States, 107 Ct. Cl. 650, 69 F. Supp. 205 (1947), and further that assigning counsel with a conflict of interest is constitutionally equivalent to denying counsel. Glosser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60 (1942). The fact still remains, unless the mere assertion of a conflict of interest is to be constitutionally the equivalent of its actuality, someone must determine if the conflict is real or based on speculations too remote for any substantial influence on decisions. The presumption of propriety of official acts obliges us to suppose that those con cerned intended Gallagher to be defended by .counsel who would be able to give him undivided loyalty. The facts giving rise to the alleged conflict being as apparent as they ever became from the statements of Gallagher and Hughes to the C.I.D., long before the trials, we must further suppose, nothing to the contrary appearing, that the asserted conflict of interest was then deemed insubstantial so far as it was adverted to at all. The Board of Beview necessarily determined, in its turn, though without opinion, that the conflict was insubstantial. We think such determinations are in an area where a tribunal which daily reviews courts-martial might be hoped to have better antennae for the imponderable and the unspoken than we would.
