III. Causation Under Federal Securities Laws

As explained in Suez Equity Investors v. Toronto-Dominion Bank, causation under federal securities laws is two-pronged: transaction causation and loss causation. Transaction causation means that but for the fraudulent statement or omission, the plaintiff would not have entered into the transaction (257 F.3d 171). Here, Fox must prove that Morrison’s recommendations induced him to invest in the unsuitable securities. Furthermore, loss causation, akin to proximate cause, requires that the fraudulent statements or omissions were the direct cause of the actual losses suffered. This involves demonstrating that the losses were a foreseeable outcome of the misrepresentations, considering intervening causes and the time lapse between misconduct and the loss (250 F.3d 87, 95-96; 27 F.3d 763, 769-70).

According to Affiliated Ute Citizens v. United States, transaction causation is presumed in claims based on material omissions (406 U.S. 128). Given that Fox has alleged Morrison's omissions regarding the risks and liquidity of the investments, this presumption could apply.

IV. Reliance and the Integrity of Market Price

The fraud-on-the-market theory posits that the market price of shares traded on efficient markets reflects all public information, including material misrepresentations. This presumption of reliance could be applicable if Fox's purchases were influenced by misleading information disseminated into the market, per Basic Inc. v. Levinson (485 U.S. 224). Here, the reliability of Morrison’s recommendations as a professional similarly could invoke this reliance presumption, as material misstatements would affect Fox’s decision-making process.

V. Summary Judgment Analysis

Fox must demonstrate that genuine disputes exist concerning the unsuitability of the investments and Morrison’s misrepresentations or omissions. Given the evidence of Fox’s sophistication as an investor and his explicit written acknowledgments of receiving investment documentation, the defendants argue that these factors negate claims of reliance on alleged fraudulent conduct. However, if Fox can provide substantiated claims indicating that Morrison knowingly recommended unsuitable investments contradicting Fox’s financial goals, a triable issue on reliance and causation might persist, preventing summary judgment.

CONCLUSION

Accordingly, defendants’ motion for summary judgment is granted with regard to some claims but requires further examination of Fox’s unsuitability and reliance issues.
