gold_text: With dismissal of the plaintiffs claims, there remain Geauga Savings’ state law counterclaims, which are before the Court pursuant to its supplemental jurisdiction. When a district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, it may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims brought under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). “[W]hen deciding whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, ‘a federal court should consider and weigh in each case, and at every stage of the litigation, the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity.’ ” City of Chicago v. International College of Surgeons, 522 U.S. 156, 173, 118 S.Ct. 523, 139 L.Ed.2d 525 (1997) (quoting Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988)). The Court has considered and weighed the relevant factors, and it declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Geauga Savings’ counterclaims. These claims will therefore be remanded to state court.
