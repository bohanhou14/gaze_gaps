Considering the constitutional arguments, it is essential to refer to pertinent case law. In 408 U.S. 564, the court held that due process requirements apply only when protected interests are implicated, and the nature of the interest at stake determines whether due process is required initially. Here, while plaintiffs argue a significant private interest, the validity of their mining claims is in question, which complicates the assessment of the importance of the private interest affected.

Similarly, in 96 F.3d 355, the court emphasized procedural due process in denying applications without a hearing. Plaintiffs contend that their due process rights were violated by the BLM regulations. However, as in 96 F.3d 355, the procedures in place, including the specific instructions and time frame for responses, were adhered to, reducing the risk of erroneous deprivation of rights.

Thus, the IBLA's adherence to its regulations, coupled with the interests of the government in maintaining consistent application of these regulations, suggests no due process violation occurred. The mandatory nature of the regulations, as supported by case precedents, further bolsters the validity of the agency's actions.

Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569-70 & n. 7, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)). It is undisputed that plaintiffs received adequate notice of the applicable regulations and of their right to a hearing. Plaintiffs were also given an opportunity to be heard. The fact that plaintiffs did not exercise their right to a hearing under the regulations by timely filing an answer is not the fault of the regulations. “The Constitution requires due process of law; it does not require an endless number of opportunities for one to assert his rights.” Silas v. Babbitt, 96 F.3d 355, 358 (9th Cir.1996).
