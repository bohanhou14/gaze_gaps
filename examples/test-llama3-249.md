Based on the reference cases, it is clear that the license granted by Randall to the defendants was not revocable by the defendants, except by mutual consent or by the fault of the other party. The case of Marsh v. Harris Mfg. Co., 63 Wisconsin, 276, supports this conclusion, as it holds that a license cannot be revoked by one party without the consent of the other. Similarly, the case of Pattersonâ€™s Appeal, 99 Penn. St. 521, and Union Mfg. Co. v. Lounsbury, 41 N. Y. 363, also support this conclusion.

In the case at hand, the defendants continued to construct and sell street cars containing the patented advertising rack, even after Randall's alleged renunciation of the license. This indicates that the notice was a mere pretence, and that the defendants continued to act under the license. The case of Newton Street Railway Company v. American Street Car Advertising Company, 32 C. C. A. 122, 88 Fed. 795, also supports this conclusion, as it holds that a license cannot be revoked by one party without the consent of the other.

The defendants' contention that the "built-in" racks are not covered by the patent or license is also unsupported by the evidence. The patent claims specifically cover the rack as a whole, including its attachment to the car. The evidence shows that the defendants' "built-in" racks are identical in construction and design to the patented rack, and are used for the same purpose. Therefore, the defendants are liable for royalties on the "built-in" racks. The case of Me. Justice Strong, 25 L. Ed. 357, also supports this conclusion, as it holds that a license can be enforced against a party who has breached its terms.

In conclusion, based on the reference cases and the evidence presented, the defendants are liable for royalties on the "built-in" racks and must account for and pay royalties to the complainant for the card racks put into the cars constructed by them since August 8, 1889. The complainant is entitled to an accounting, unless barred by laches. The case is reversed, with directions to enter a judgment in favor of the complainant.

gold_text: This action can be maintained in equity because the license was granted, went into effect, and both parties recognized and acted under it. It could not be revoked or ended except by mutual consent. The defendants have never consented to its revocation. True, they say the patent was invalid, but this is not an assent to a revocation of the license. This license was exclusive. The defendants have not repudiated or given notice of a repudiation of the license except by the answer denying its existence. The defendants, under the facts of this case, are presumed to have constructed these racks under and in pursuance of the license. Holmes, Booth & H. v. McGill, 47 C. C. A. 296, 108 Fed. 244; Marston v. Swett, 66 N. Y. 211, 23 Am. Rep. 43; Id., 82 N. Y. 526; Rawes v. Purser, 38 Eng. R. & E. Rep. 48; White v. Lee (C. C.) 14 Fed. 789; Birdsall v. Perego, 5 Blatchf. 251, Fed. Cas. No. 1,435; Stott v. Rutherford, 92 U. S. 107, 23 L. Ed. 486; Eureka Co. v. Bailey Co., 11 Wall. 488, 20 L. Ed. 209; 3 Rob. Pat. 696, note 5. A license not expressly limited in duration continues until the patent expires or the license is forfeited, if not terminated by mutual consent. St. Paul Plow Works v. Starling, 140 U. S. 196, 11 Sup. Ct. 803, 35 L. Ed. 404; Hartell v. Tilghman, 99 U. S. 556, 25 L. Ed. 357. A royalty contract is not ended by a failure to pay royalties. White v. Lee (C. C.) 3 Fed. 222. This overrules Brooks v. Stolley, 3 McLean, 523, Fed. Cas. No. 1,962. It seems clear, therefore, that, unless barred by laches, the complainant is entitled to the relief demanded.
