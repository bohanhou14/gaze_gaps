In exercising discretion on whether to retain jurisdiction, the court is guided by principles well-established in admiralty jurisprudence. The Supreme Court in Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson Co., 285 U.S. 413, 422, reiterated the discretionary nature of jurisdiction in admiralty cases involving foreign parties, quoting Langnes v. Green, 282 U.S. 531, 544, where it was noted that a court should decline jurisdiction if justice is adequately served by remitting parties to their home forum.

Further, the Supreme Court in Charter Shipping Co. v. Bowring, Jones & Tidy, Ltd., 281 U.S. 515, 517, supported the discretionary authority of admiralty courts to decide matters involving foreign seamen and vessels. Similarly, in Massachusetts v. Missouri, 308 U.S. 1, 18, it was observed that jurisdiction should not be exercised when another suitable forum is available, emphasizing considerations of "convenience, efficiency, and justice" (Rogers v. Guaranty Trust Co., 288 U.S. 123, 130).

Given the substantial foreign elements in the current case, including the foreign residency of the plaintiff and defendant, and the foreign base of operations, the court finds compelling grounds not to exercise jurisdiction. As established in the synthesis of these precedents, the discretionary authority vested in this court supports a decision to decline jurisdiction. Therefore, the complaint is dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds and lack of subject matter jurisdiction, guided by the judicial principles set forth in the aforementioned cases.
