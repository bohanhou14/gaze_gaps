The doctrine of collateral estoppel has no role to play in the dischargeability determination. In reference case 4 B.R. 814, several courts and commentators have taken the position that collateral estoppel has no role to play in the dischargeability determination. The court in Franks, supra, held that, notwithstanding a federal district court’s judgment, the bankruptcy court was not estopped to make an independent determination of dischargeability. The facts in that case are similar to the facts in the present case.

In the instant case, the court must determine whether or not the debt in question may be excepted from discharge under § 523(a)(6). Section 523(a)(6) excepts from discharge debts “for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.” The court must also determine whether or not the debt is excepted from discharge under § 523(a)(2)(A), which excepts from discharge debts obtained by “false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor’s or an insider’s financial condition.”

In reference case 20 B.R. 7, the court held that collateral estoppel bars relitigation of facts, in a subsequent action between the same parties upon a different cause of action, that were actually decided and necessary to the decision in the prior action. However, in the instant case, the court finds that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply, as the prior judgment was entered by default and the debtor did not actually litigate the issues.

In conclusion, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply in this case, and the court must make an independent determination of dischargeability. The court finds that the debt in question is excepted from discharge under § 523(a)(6) and § 523(a)(2)(A).

gold_text: In contrast to these cases is In re Grazi-ano, supra., The debtor pled guilty to second degree larceny under New York state law at his arraignment. When the aggrieved party sought to utilize the doctrine of collateral estoppel in its action under Code § 523(a)(4), the bankruptcy court refused, holding that criteria number “(2)” of the four-part test had not been met. The court consequently allowed debtor to introduce evidence at an evidentiary hearing on issues raised by his prior guilty plea, finding support for this result in a line of cases declining to give collateral estoppel effect to prior default judgments. Id., 35 B.R. at 595 n. 1; See Matter of McMillan, supra, 579 F.2d at 292-93; First National Bank of Gainesville v. Grainger (In re Grainger), 20 B.R. 7, 10 (Bankr.D.S.C.1981); Franks v. Thomason, 4 B.R. 814, 821 (N.D.Ga.1980). The bankruptcy court considered the evidence taken at the evidentia-ry hearing prior to declaring the debt non-dischargeable.
