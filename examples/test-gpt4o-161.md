In addition, the defendants argue that the question of whether § 3116 can be applied when the facts bring the case within the prohibition of § 3253 was not raised in prior cases such as Seib or Kent. However, the courts have consistently held that § 3116 applies to a broad range of violations of internal revenue laws relating to spirituous liquors, not merely limited to industrial alcohol (158 F.2d 196). The judgment in United States v. 3935 Cases of Distilled Spirits reaffirmed this interpretation, indicating that forfeiture provisions are applicable to any violation of revenue laws concerning distilled spirits (158 F.2d 445).

Moreover, the argument that § 3253 exclusively governs forfeitures related to the nonpayment of special taxes lacks support. The appropriateness of forfeitures under § 3116 for such violations has been fortified in past judicial considerations (Seib v. United States, 8 Cir., 150 F.2d 673, and United States v. One 1942 Pontiac Sedan Automobile, D.C., 56 F.Supp. 929). These cases confirm that § 3116 indeed provides a comprehensive legal framework for addressing property used or intended to be used in violation of internal revenue laws, encompassing situations beyond merely unpaid special taxes.

Thus, the defendants’ contention that the statutes exclusively provide for the seizure of property associated with wilful nonpayment of special taxes under § 3253 fails, as both statutory provisions align to allow for the necessary legal actions under the circumstances presented (158 F.2d 196; 158 F.2d 445).
