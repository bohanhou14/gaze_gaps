In the case of Sinthasomphone, the allegations are that the police officers actively prevented private citizens from helping the victim and delivered him into the custody of his killer, Jeffrey Dahmer. This active intervention by the police creates a "special relationship" between the state and the victim, which is different from the situation in DeShaney, where the state's failure to act did not constitute a violation of the due process clause (457 U.S. 307).

The police officers' actions in Sinthasomphone's case are similar to those in Ross v. United States, where the court found that the county's policy of preventing private sources of rescue without providing a meaningful alternative constituted a violation of the due process clause (932 F.2d 10). In both cases, the state's actions created a situation where the victim was at risk of harm, and the state's failure to take action to prevent that harm constituted a violation of the due process clause.

In contrast, DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services held that the state's failure to act did not constitute a violation of the due process clause, as the state did not create the danger and did not subject the victim to an existing danger (429 U.S. 97). However, the Sinthasomphone case is different, as the police officers' actions created a situation where the victim was at risk of harm, and the state's failure to take action to prevent that harm constitutes a violation of the due process clause.

In conclusion, the allegations in Sinthasomphone's case create a "special relationship" between the state and the victim, which is different from the situation in DeShaney. The police officers' actions in Sinthasomphone's case are similar to those in Ross v. United States, and the court should find that the state's failure to take action to prevent the harm constitutes a violation of the due process clause.

gold_text: Outside of prisons [Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)] or mental institutions [Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982) ] courts have been reluctant to find special relationships. For example, in Harris v. District of Columbia, 932 F.2d 10 (D.C.Cir.1991), the court considered whether police officers had a qualified immunity from suit. The officers took Derrick D. Harris into custody. He was suffering severe effects from an overdose of PCP. There was a delay in getting him admitted to a hospital and he died. The court determined that the police officers were not under “a clearly established constitutional obligation to obtain medical care for Harris” based on a special relationship with him and that they therefore were entitled to a qualified immunity. The majority opinion indicated, however, that they were deciding the qualified immunity issue: whether an obligation was “clearly established,” not whether a constitutional obligation existed. A fine point, and one which will no doubt arise again in this case.
