In the case of Duffey, the court was faced with the issue of whether the taxpayer's invested capital should be reduced by the fair market value or the cost basis of the property distributed. The taxpayer argued that the property goes out of equity invested capital at its fair market value at the time of distribution, while the government contended that it goes out at its cost basis.

The court noted that the statute is silent on the issue and that there is no clear guidance on how to calculate the reduction of equity invested capital. However, the court found that the taxpayer's argument was supported by the regulation, which provides that the equity invested capital of a corporation shall be reduced by virtue of distributions to a negative amount if the amount of distribution exceeds the amount of equity invested capital computed without regard to such distributions.

The court also noted that the regulation provides that the purchase by a corporation of its own stock for investment does not result in a reduction of invested capital, but if the corporation subsequently cancels such stock, invested capital is reduced beginning with the day following such cancellation.

In the case of United States v. Merriam, 263 U.S. 179, the court held that if the words are doubtful, the doubt must be resolved against the government and in favor of the taxpayer. Similarly, in the case of United States v. Missouri P. R. Co., 278 U.S. 269, the court held that construction may not be substituted for legislation, and that the words of the statute must be taken at their face value.

In the case of Commissioner v. Ganey, 136 F.2d 303, the court held that the Commissioner's determination that the value of the property distributed was its cost basis was not supported by the evidence.

In conclusion, the court held that the taxpayer's invested capital should be reduced by the fair market value of the property distributed, and that the regulation provides guidance on how to calculate the reduction of equity invested capital. The court also noted that the statute is silent on the issue and that the taxpayer's argument is supported by the regulation and the cases cited above.
