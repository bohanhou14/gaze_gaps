gold_text: Lumbermens next argues that Ma-tush was not qualified to attest to the data entered into the database because he did not input each piece of data that underlies the summaries. However, there is no dispute that Matush, as a Republic Western claims manager, was qualified to testify about the business practices and procedures for inputting the underlying data. It is not necessary for each individual who entered a record of payment into the database to testify as to the accuracy of each piece of data entered. See United States v. Smith, 609 F.2d 1294, 1302 (9th Cir.1979) (“The witness must only be in a position to attest to [the evidence’s] authenticity”) (citation and internal quotations omitted); see also Thanongsinh v. Bd. of Educ., 462 F.3d 762, 777 (7th Cir.2006) (holding that the qualified witness “need only be familiar with the company’s recordkeeping practices”); Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 803.08[4] (stating that witnesses to an electronic data compilation need not personally enter the data).
