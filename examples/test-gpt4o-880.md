In our analysis, it is essential to consider the implications of the Illinois Brick doctrine and its exceptions as outlined in pivotal cases. According to Kansas v. Utilicorp United, Inc., 497 U.S. 199 (1990), the Illinois Brick doctrine primarily recognizes two exceptions: ownership and control between entities involved in the distribution chain. In the present case, neither exception is applicable, as the wholesalers are independent dealers without any ownership or control relationship with American Cyanamid (Reference 123 F.3d 599). Thus, the wholesalers here are not corporate affiliates of the manufacturers nor controlled through interlocking directorates, minority stock ownership, or other methods of operational control.

Furthermore, the Utilicorp decision reinforced that indirect purchasers could not press antitrust claims unless fitting within the aforementioned exceptions. This reaffirmation supports our conclusion that the Illinois Brick doctrine does not preclude Plaintiffs' claims in a vertical conspiracy where no "pass-on" is alleged, and Plaintiffs are direct purchasers from entities conspiring with the manufacturer (Reference 497 U.S. 199). These specific circumstances underscore that Plaintiffs hold standing to pursue their antitrust claims directly against American Cyanamid.

In summary, given that Plaintiffs are direct purchasers and the nature of the allegations involves a vertical conspiracy devoid of any "pass-on" necessity, the Illinois Brick doctrine's limitations do not apply, warranting the reversal and remand of the district court's decision.

Utili-Corp United, Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 110 S.Ct. 2807, 111 L.Ed.2d 169 (1990), do not bear on our decision. First, In re Brand Name is distinguishable for the same reasons as Austin and In re Beef. Second, that the Supreme Court refused to carve out another exception to the Illinois Brick doctrine in UtiliCorp — a case where the facts seemed ripe for an exception — is unremarkable. Plaintiffs here, unlike in Utili- Corp, are not looking for an exception to Illinois Brick based on the facts of a particular market; Illinois Brick simply does not apply to this kind of conspiracy.
