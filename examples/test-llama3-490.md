The district court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress is also supported by the Supreme Court's decision in Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806 (1996). In Whren, the Court held that an officer's subjective intent when making a traffic stop "plays no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis." Id. at 813. Similarly, in United States v. Garza, 10 F.3d 1241 (1993), this court held that a warrantless search of a vehicle is reasonable if it is based on probable cause developed during the course of a legitimate investigatory stop. Id. at 1246.

In this case, the officer's stop of defendant's vehicle was based on his suspicion that the vehicle's windows were illegally tinted. While the officer did not test the windows at the scene, the evidence presented at the suppression hearing established that the windows were, in fact, in violation of the ordinance. The stop was therefore valid, and the officer's subsequent search of the vehicle was reasonable.

Defendant's argument that the stop was pretextual is without merit. As the Supreme Court noted in Whren, "the decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred." Id. at 810. In this case, the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant's vehicle was in violation of the tint ordinance, and the stop was therefore reasonable.

Finally, defendant's argument that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress is also without merit. As this court has previously held, "the decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred." United States v. Shank, 543 F.3d 309 (2008). In this case, the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant's vehicle was in violation of the tint ordinance, and the stop was therefore reasonable.

Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress.

gold_text: The district court credited Officer McCoy’s testimony that he smelled raw marijuana and observed both air fresheners and cell phones in the backseat of the automobile, all of which are indicators of drug trafficking. These observations gave Officer McCoy probable cause to search the vehicle. In fact, this court has noted on various occasions that the odor of drugs in a vehicle is sufficient to establish probable cause to search that vehicle. See United States v. Foster, 376 F.3d 577, 583-84 (6th Cir.2004); United States v. Garza, 10 F.3d 1241, 1246 (6th Cir.1993) (“[W]e find that Agent Perman’s smelling the marijuana then constituted probable cause to believe that there was marijuana in the vehicle. Once this probable cause existed, a search warrant was not necessary.”). Because Officer McCoy had probable cause to search the vehicle after his initial encounter with defendant, the defendant’s later statement about the existence of a firearm is superfluous to our analysis.
