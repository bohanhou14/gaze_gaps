In this consolidated appeal, the sole issue is whether the lower courts correctly determined that Educational Credit Management Corporation (ECMC) was precluded from applying the Debtors' Chapter 13 plan payments to post-petition interest on their nondischargeable student loan debts. The Debtors argue that, under § 502(b)(2), ECMC cannot apply estate payments to post-petition interest on nondischargeable student loan debts.

However, this argument relies on a flawed understanding of the relationship between § 502(b)(2) and the nondischargeability of student loan debts. As the court in Bruning v. United States, 376 U.S. 358 (1964), recognized, "the basic reasons for the rule denying post-petition interest as a claim against the bankruptcy estate are the avoidance of unfairness as between competing creditors and the avoidance of administrative inconvenience." Id. at 362-63. These reasons are inapplicable to an action brought against the debtor personally.

Similarly, in Leeper v. Pennsylvania Higher Educ. Assistance Agency, 49 F.3d 98 (1995), the court noted that § 502(b)(2) only addresses the treatment of unmatured interest, not the treatment of post-petition interest on nondischargeable debts.

Furthermore, § 523(a)(8) explicitly provides that student loan debt is nondischargeable absent a showing of undue hardship. In re Johnson, 5 B.C.D. 532, 537 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1979). As the court in Rice v. Foust, 78 F.3d 1149 (1996), noted, "a discharge based on undue hardship requires a debtor to show that the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a'minimal' standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans." Id. at 1151.

In conclusion, ECMC was not precluded from applying the Debtors' Chapter 13 plan payments to post-petition interest on their nondischargeable student loan debts. The court in In re Kielisch, 46 B.R. 752 (Bankr. E.D. Wis. 1985), correctly held that creditors are not precluded from applying bankruptcy estate payments to accrued post-petition interest on nondischargeable student loan debts.

gold_text: Id. (quoting In re Brunner, 46 B.R. 752, 753 (Bank.S.D.N.Y.1985)); see also In re Hornsby, 144 F.3d 433, 437 (6th Cir.1998) (considering the same factors, along with the amount of debt, the rate of interest, and the debtor's claimed expenses and current standard of living). Because the Debtors did not seek to establish undue hardship in the proceedings below, we do not address whether the Debtors qualify for an undue hardship discharge based upon their reliance on ECMC’s proofs of claim, which included only principal and prepetition interest, in planning their finances based upon the assumption that the principal on their student loan debts would be fully paid by their estates.
