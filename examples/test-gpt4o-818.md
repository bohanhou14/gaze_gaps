The doctrine of res judicata, as elaborated in the case of Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U.S. 165, establishes that once a final judgment has been rendered, it is conclusive as to the rights of the parties and bars further litigation on the same issues. The principle applies here as appellant's claims against the validity of the judgment are precluded because the original judgment was affirmed, and no appeal was taken from the bankruptcy orders.

Moreover, in the context of the court's power to adjudicate its jurisdiction, 308 U.S. 371 emphasizes that a court sitting in bankruptcy has the authority to determine its jurisdiction and its decision is res judicata in collateral proceedings. Similarly, as reiterated in 59 S. Ct. 134, the confirmation of a reorganization plan binding all creditors underscores the finality of the judgments made in bankruptcy proceedings, thereby precluding subsequent challenges.

110 F.2d 72 reinforces that the validity of procedural decisions made by the court must be adhered to and any deviation, such as a jurisdictional error, renders subsequent actions void if not properly appealed. In this case, the appellant's challenge to the validity of the sentences imposed on Counts One and Two, based on alleged merger and double jeopardy, reflects an attempt to revisit a matter conclusively adjudicated.

Thus, in view of the cited precedents, it is evident that the relief appellant seeks is inconsistent with established legal principles. The judgment should be reversed, and directions given to vacate the sentence on one of the counts, leaving the other to stand, adhering to the precedent that only one valid sentence can be maintained. The principles enunciated in Dimenza v. Johnston, Coy v. Johnston, and Holbrook v. United States should guide the remand.
