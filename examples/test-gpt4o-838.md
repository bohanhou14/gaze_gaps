**Generation:**

Hotel room charges generally do not constitute rents under relevant case law, supporting the conclusion that the referenced hotel revenues here are not rents. As established in 131 B.R. 523, "a hotel guest does not obtain an interest in the underlying real property but is a mere licensee with a personal right to use the premises.‚Äù Likewise, in 111 B.R. 332, the court noted that hotel guests are licensees, not tenants, and that their payments are better characterized as accounts receivable rather than rents. This is echoed in 94 B.R. 645, where it was held that charges for hotel rooms are generally classified as rates and not rents. Furthermore, under 92 B.R. 95, the court underscored that hotel room revenues are in the nature of payment under contract or on account and not "rents" in the traditional landlord-tenant context. Hence, Georgia law and case precedents collectively support that FSA's security interest in rents does not extend to the postpetition hotel revenues in this case.

gold_text: Admittedly, the dichotomy is not exact. Some hotels provide only minimal services, while some landlords do provide services to tenants. The Court, however, concludes, that on balance this dichotomy is further evidence that hotel revenues are not rents, but an account. This conclusion is consistent with the majority of court which have addressed this issue. See e.g., In re Miami Center Associates, Ltd., 144 B.R. at 941; In re Majestic Motel Associates, Inc., 131 B.R. 523 (Bankr.D.Me.1991); In re Shore Haven Motor Inn, Inc., 124 B.R. 617 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1991); In re Vickers, Ltd., 111 B.R. 332 (D.Colo.1990) In re Ashkenazy Enterprises, Inc., 94 B.R. 645 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.1986); In re Kearney Hotel Partners, 92 B.R. 95 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1988). But See In re S.F. Drake Hotel Associates, 131 B.R. at 158-161 (room charges are more like rent than an account).
