**Generation:**

In reaching our conclusion, we find significant guidance from key precedents, particularly from Reference Case 327 U.S. 173 and the associated elaboration in 90 L. Ed. 603. These cases decisively underscore that employees engaged in local window-cleaning tasks for customers engaged in interstate commerce fall under the Actâ€™s purview because their work is closely related and necessary to the production of goods for commerce, despite being within a single state.

Applying this reasoning here, the question pivots on whether the construction of these farm ponds, by their integral role in flood control, meets the threshold of being "closely related" and "directly essential to the production" of goods for commerce. The precedent establishes that the interpretation of "necessary" work includes activities like window cleaning on premises used for interstate commerce production (327 U.S. 173), suggesting that activities with more direct infrastructural impacts, like constructing flood control dams, warrant inclusion under similar rationale.

However, distinctions in the cases, such as those spotlighted in Zachary and Wade Lahar, imply a threshold: while flood control concerns are vital, the linkage to commerce must be more proximate and unmistakable than generalized support roles.

Thus, guided by the substantive line drawn in these reference cases, particularly Roland Electrical Co. v. Walling as discussed in both 327 U.S. 173 and 90 L. Ed. 603, we determine the farm pond construction in question does not satisfy the stringent criteria to be deemed "directly essential" to interstate commerce under the Act.
