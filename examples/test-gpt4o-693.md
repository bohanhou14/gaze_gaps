Furthermore, precedents such as In Re Terry, 12 B.R. at 582 and Matter of McGraw, 18 B.R. 140 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Wis.1982), clarify that the cost of defending in a civil suit alone does not constitute "great prejudice" significant enough to bar modification of the stay. As in McGraw, where the involvement of co-defendants extraneous to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court was a critical factor, here, the presence of Rosengarten and other defendants further justifies lifting the stay. Additionally, lifting the stay aligns with the intentions recognized by Congress to permit suits to proceed in their original forum when no "great prejudice" to the bankruptcy estate arises (see 33 B.R. 937). This approach prevents duplicative litigation and maintains judicial economy by allowing the state court to adjudicate the interconnected issues efficiently. Therefore, the equities of the situation, considering both the pending state court actions and the overlapping claims, warrant the lifting of the automatic stay under § 362(d).

gold_text: Because it appears that no great prejudice to the debtor’s bankruptcy estate would result, the Court finds that it is more appropriate to permit continuance of the state court proceedings in their place of origin. It is clear that movants’ claim will have to be liquidated either in state court or the bankruptcy court. In either instance, the debtor will have to defend that action. It is unreasonable to presume that the continuance in the state court would subject the debtor’s estate to a greater expense. The cost of defending the state court action in the state court has not been considered so prejudicial as to require continuance of the stay. In re McGraw, 18 B.R. 140, 142 (Bankr.W.D.Wis.1982); Hoenig v. Hoffman (In re Hoffman), 33 B.R. 937, 941 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1983). It is certainly possible that continuance of the stay would cause great prejudice to the mov-ants. Because the debtor’s partner is a codefendant in the state action, movants would be required to proceed against the debtor in the bankruptcy court and against the debtor’s partner in the state court. See Hoffman, supra, 33 B.R. at 941.
