Furthermore, appellant cites the improper admission of certain evidence during trial. Specifically, she argues that the mention of her refusal to continue the post-arrest interrogation should have been excluded based on her implied invocation of the Fifth Amendment right, as previously discussed in reference case 424 F.2d 1209. However, this court finds that any error in admitting this evidence was harmless given the strong admissible evidence presented, aligning with the precedent set in Harrington v. California and Chapman v. California.

Additionally, appellant contends that the prosecution's comments during summation constituted prejudicial error. In reference case 103 F.2d 876, it was established that improper prosecutorial remarks and the introduction of unsanctioned testimony warrant careful scrutiny. However, given the substantial evidence of guilt and the discretionary latitude afforded to trial courts in such instances, as illustrated in reference case 416 F.2d 61, this court does not find sufficient prejudice to overturn the verdict.

In conclusion, while the conduct of the government’s counsel is censurable, the substantial evidence supporting the guilty verdicts renders the errors harmless. The judgments of conviction are therefore affirmed.

Allsenberrie, 424 F.2d 1209 (7th Cir. 1970); United States v. Sprengel, 103 F.2d 876 (3rd Cir. 1939). Nevertheless, we are satisfied that what error was injected in the trial proceedings was “harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Appellant was apprehended at the border driving an automobile containing 266 pounds of contraband. Her testimonial profession that she was without any knowledge of the illicit cargo’s presence was inferentially refuted by the testimony of her daughter. In light of this evidence, we are satisfied that the three statements in controversy did not influence the jury’s decision. United States v. Wick, 416 F.2d 61 (7th Cir. 1969), cert. den. 396 U.S. 961, 90 S.Ct. 430, 24 L.Ed.2d 425 (1969).
