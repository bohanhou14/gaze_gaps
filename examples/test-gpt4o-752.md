Moreover, the principles drawn from the case of 880 F.2d 1540 further solidify the interpretation of the term "obligation" under section 365(d)(3) of the Code. In 880 F.2d 1540, the court held that the automatic stay prohibits the creation of a local tax lien upon real property unless the county has a prepetition interest in the property and entitles the county to a priority for postpetition interest on valid tax liens. This highlights that obligations arising postpetition under a lease are distinct and must be addressed separately from prepetition claims (880 F.2d 1540).

Similarly, in our case, the reassessed taxes that were issued postpetition are categorized as postpetition obligations of the debtor under the Lease, necessitating timely performance under section 365(d)(3). This differentiation underscores that Bullock’s obligation to reimburse MaceRich for the reassessed taxes strictly emanates from the postpetition issuance of supplemental tax statements, thus making it a clear-cut obligation that must be fulfilled promptly.

Therefore, in light of the principles established in both the current case and the referenced case law (880 F.2d 1540), it is evident that MaceRich’s motion to compel current payment of reassessed taxes aligns with the statutory framework and prevailing judicial interpretations.
