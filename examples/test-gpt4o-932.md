This Court notes similar circumstances in 54 B.R. 844, where services performed without prior court approval resulted in disallowance of fees. In our case, although Dunhill rendered professional services to First Security post-petition, the lack of court approval raises a comparable issue. Moreover, as 19 B.R. 660 emphasizes, even services performed due to "excusable neglect" require court approval, reconfirming that Dunhill's administrative claim may face similar deficiencies.

However, referencing 308 U.S. 295, the Court recalls that the owner of a corporation must not misuse corporate control to sidestep liabilities. In this vein, Dunhill's claim retains merit as its services undeniably provided benefit, and it should not be deprived of compensation due to First Security's mismanagement.

In sum, pursuant to the rationale in 310 U.S. 434, while Dunhill's fee is justifiable as reasonable compensation for necessary post-petition services, complete adherence to procedural requirements as mandated under bankruptcy law cannot be overlooked.

gold_text: Some courts have purported to deny all compensation, no matter how valuable the services rendered or how innocent the infraction, when court approval was not obtained before the employment commenced or the services were rendered; see In re Windsor Communications Group, Inc., 54 B.R. 844 (B.C., E.D.Penn.1985). 11 U.S.C. § 330(a), read literally, indicates that compensation is owing only to one who is “employed” under § 327; and § 327(a) makes it clear that employment must be approved at some time by the Court; but none of the statutes here involved provide in so many words that compensation is owing only where the Court’s approval has been given in advance of employment. Automatic disallowance of any fee no matter what the circumstances is not only uncalled-for by the statutory language but unjustifiable in equity and insupportable as a matter of policy. In equity, it is apparent that such a rule tends to confer an unjust enrichment on the estate which has received valuable services without having to pay anything for them, and inflicts a substantial penalty for a “wrong” that may be merely technical in nature, innocent in intention, and otherwise harmless in effect. A court of equity is seldom justified in disregarding quantum meruit. As a matter of policy, it is apparent that so ferocious a penalty goes beyond what is needed to guard against the occasional “officious intermeddler or ... gratuitous volunteer,” 2 Collier on Bankruptcy (15th ed. 1990) ¶ 327.02 p. 327-7, and see In re King Electric Co., Inc., 19 B.R. 660 (E.D.Va.1982); and will make a discreet provider of services avoid a bankruptcy case as he would avoid a minefield, thereby defeating the underlying policy of encouraging post-petition support for entities attempting to reorganize. The rule of automatic, invariable and total forfeiture of fee is made all the more inappropriate in cases such as the present one by the difficulty of deciding who is or is not a “professional person” subject to § 327(a) — this is a terrible thing to do to one who has given good service in good faith merely because his opinion on an obscure and difficult point of law differs from that of the judge,. This Court is under the impression that bankruptcy is essentially an exercise in intelligent equity, albeit regularized by Congressional enactments, Bank of Marin v. England, 385 U.S. 99, 87 S.Ct. 274, 17 L.Ed.2d 197 (1966); Securities & Exchange Comm. v. United States Realty & Improvement Co., 310 U.S. 434, 60 S.Ct. 1044, 84 L.Ed. 1293 (1940); Pepper v. Litton, 308 U.S. 295, 60 S.Ct. 238, 84 L.Ed. 281 (1939). There is no place in such a scheme for so savage a rule.
