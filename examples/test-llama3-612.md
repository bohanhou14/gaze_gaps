In the context of the case, abstention is not appropriate as the question of the retroactive application of section 5.02(13) is an unsettled issue of state law. According to Railroad Commission v. Pullman, 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), abstention is only proper when the case presents a difficult, obscure, or unsettled issue of state law, the resolution of which could eliminate or substantially narrow the scope of the federal constitutional issue.

In this case, the language "Notwithstanding the terms of any franchise agreement" could be construed to give the statute retroactive effect or prospective effect, making it an unsettled issue of state law. As stated in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 341 (Brandeis, J., concurring), abstention operates to require piecemeal adjudication in many courts, thereby delaying ultimate adjudication on the merits for an undue length of time.

Furthermore, as mentioned in O'Hair v. White, 675 F.2d 680, abstention is not proper when the state courts have not interpreted the subject statute, and the law is therefore unclear. In this case, the Texas courts have not examined the entire Motor Vehicle Code in an effort to resolve this issue, making it uncertain how they would choose to apply the statute.

In conclusion, abstention is not proper in this case as the question of the retroactive application of section 5.02(13) is an unsettled issue of state law. The federal court should not be reluctant to resolve this unambiguous question of state law.
