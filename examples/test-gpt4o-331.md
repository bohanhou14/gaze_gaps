**Generation:**

In remanding the case for a new trial, we draw upon past precedents that emphasize the jury’s critical role in weighing evidence and resolving factual disputes. As noted in reference case 447 F.2d 1293, "the jury in its day-to-day homely wisdom could have found that the defendant knew or should have known" pertinent facts. Similarly, our reliance on the standard articulated in Boeing Co. v. Shipman aligns with this principle by ensuring that "reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions."

Additionally, this issue echoes the findings in reference case 304 U.S. 64, where the U.S. Supreme Court observed the importance of allowing juries to interpret and reconcile factual discrepancies. The evidentiary burden on the appellant, therefore, encompasses demonstrating sufficient factors—such as the truck’s turn signal and positioning—to reasonably infer Allred’s intent to turn.

This case's resolution depends on the jury’s discerning assessment of the presented evidence, reinforcing the broader jurisprudential framework that mandates careful consideration of conflicting testimonies and indicators in rendering a lawful and just verdict. Therefore, reversal is warranted to ensure that the appellant’s right to a jury trial is upheld, and all relevant factors are judiciously evaluated.

Reversed and remanded.

gold_text: The Boeing case was meant to end the controversy regarding when the jury may be evicted from a case, but once again we have before us a case of unwarranted jury displacement. Although we are without the use of a computer to afford us a complete statistical survey, we nevertheless suspect that such cases are legion and that their ranks are increasing. See, e. g., Trawick v. Manhattan Life Ins. Co., 5 Cir. 1971, 447 F.2d 1293. In a case such as we have here, where shards of evidence have been produced on opposite sides of almost every issue, jury exile should be almost as rare as a museum piece. Boeing Co. v. Ship-man’s guidelines are as engrained upon our jurisprudence as Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 1938, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188. Its every precept and inference was not heeded in the trial below, and we must therefore reverse and remand.
