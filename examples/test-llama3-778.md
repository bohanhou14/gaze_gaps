In the case of Modern Controls, Inc. v. Andreadakis, the court denied a preliminary injunction to enforce a covenant not to compete. However, upon appeal, the court reversed the decision, holding that the covenant was enforceable. The court found that the covenant was supported by independent consideration, specifically the payment of Andreadakis's base salary for two years if he could not find suitable work in another field. This consideration was sufficient to support the covenant, as the court in Bradford v. New York Times Company, 501 F.2d 51 (2d Cir. 1974), has held.

The court also rejected Andreadakis's argument that the covenant was overly broad and unenforceable. The court applied the "blue pencil doctrine," striking the offending provision from the agreement and enforcing the covenant not to compete. This doctrine has been applied in cases such as Bess v. Bothman, Minn., 257 N.W.2d 791 (1977), and Alside, Inc. v. Larson, 300 Minn. 285, 294, 220 N.W.2d 274, 280 (1974).

The court further held that Modern Controls would suffer irreparable harm if the covenant not to compete was not enforced. Andreadakis's knowledge of Modern Controls's confidential business information would give Burroughs a significant advantage over its competitor, and Andreadakis's refusal to disclose this information could not be relied upon. This holding is consistent with the court's decision in Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375, 383, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970), which held that the use of a solicitation that is misleading or deceptive is unlawful.

In summary, the court reversed the denial of the preliminary injunction and held that the covenant not to compete was enforceable. The court found that the covenant was supported by independent consideration and that Modern Controls would suffer irreparable harm if the covenant was not enforced. The court's decision is consistent with the holdings in Bradford v. New York Times Company, 501 F.2d 51 (2d Cir. 1974), and Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375, 383, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970).

gold_text: . This Circuit has recently adopted an alternative test for preliminary injunctive relief developed by the Second Circuit. Relief is appropriate under this test if there are sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardship tips decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary relief. Fennell v. Butler, 570 F.2d 263, 264 (8th Cir. 1978). See Greshan v. Chambers, 501 F.2d 687, 691 (2d Cir. 1974); Sonesta lntâ€™l Hotels Corp. v. Wellington Associates, 483 F.2d 247, 250 (2d Cir. 1973). The District Court determined that Modern Controls was not entitled to relief under either test.
