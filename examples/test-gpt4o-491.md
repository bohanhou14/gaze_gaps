In her third point on appeal, Ms. Benton argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on grounds that were never argued by the defendants. Specifically, Ms. Benton contends that the court's sua sponte summary judgment on certain grounds deprived her of notice and the opportunity to present her evidence, similar to the concerns highlighted in Procter & Gamble Co. v. Haugen, 317 F.3d 1121, 1132 (10th Cir.2003), and Mustang Fuel Corp. v. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., 480 F.2d 607, 608 (10th Cir.1973). However, summary judgment sua sponte can be appropriate if the losing party was on notice and not prejudiced by the lack of opportunity, as emphasized in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326 (1986) (referenced in 398 F.3d 1239).

Ms. Benton failed to show that she suffered prejudice due to lack of notice. Her claims largely hinged on speculative assertions and lacked substantive evidence, akin to Mr. Graham’s situation in 859 F.2d 142, where the premature grant of summary judgment without proper notice was deemed problematic. Here, the district court provided sufficient reasoning based on the provided evidence, concluding that Ms. Benton could not establish causality or pretext.

Accordingly, her arguments against summary judgment on unargued grounds do not hold, as sufficient notice and opportunities to present evidence were effectively provided. This aligns with cases where lack of new material facts negates reversing summary judgments made sua sponte (398 F.3d 1239).

IV. Conclusion
For the reasons stated, the district court's summary judgment in favor of the defendants is AFFIRMED.

Generally, a district court cannot grant summary judgment to a defendant on an issue not presented in the defendant’s motion for summary judgment without notice to the plaintiff. Graham v. City of Okla. City, 859 F.2d 142, 145 (10th Cir.1988). But, “[i]f a losing party was not prejudiced by the lack of notice, we will not reverse simply because the grant of summary judgment came sua sponte.” Ward v. Utah, 398 F.3d 1239, 1245-46 (10th Cir. 2005). In her brief, Ms. Benton claims that “[t]he district court’s grant of summary judgment [was] based on factual arguments that Defendants did not make, and which Plaintiff had no notice were at issue.” Aplt.
