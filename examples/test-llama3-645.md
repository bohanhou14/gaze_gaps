In the case at hand, the district court was tasked with determining the drug quantity attributable to the defendant. According to United States v. Randall, 171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999), the government must prove the drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence. In cases where direct evidence is lacking, the court must rely on indirect evidence, such as witness testimony. United States v. Cook, 76 F.3d 596, 604 (4th Cir.1996), holds that lay witness testimony can be used to establish drug quantities, although the court must ensure that the testimony is reliable.

In this case, the district court relied on witness testimony to determine the drug quantity. United States v. Sampson, 140 F.3d 585, 592 (4th Cir.1998), cautions that when witness estimates are uncertain, the court should sentence at the low end of the range to which the witnesses testified. Here, the district court chose a method for interpreting the evidence that ensured that only drug quantities proven by a preponderance were attributed to the defendant.

The court's finding of 2,414 grams of crack cocaine was not clearly erroneous, as it was based on credible witness testimony. United States v. McManus, 23 F.3d 878, 882 (4th Cir.1994), holds that the district court's obligation is to choose a method for interpreting the evidence that ensures that only drug quantities proven by a preponderance are attributed to a defendant.

In conclusion, the district court's finding of 2,414 grams of crack cocaine was procedurally reasonable and substantively reasonable. The court's method for interpreting the evidence was proper, and its finding was based on credible witness testimony. United States v. D'Anjou, 16 F.3d 604, 614 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 2754, 129 L.Ed.2d 871 (1994), allows the court to approximate the quantity of controlled substance when there is no direct evidence.
