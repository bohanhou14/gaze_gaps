Based on the provided reference cases, it is clear that the courts have established guidelines for sentencing and rehabilitation. In Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319, the Supreme Court held that a district court cannot lengthen a sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or promote rehabilitation. However, the court can make recommendations to the Bureau of Prisons regarding treatment programs and discuss the benefits of such programs with defendants at sentencing.

In United States v. Blackmon, 662 F.3d 981, the court concluded that there was no plain error affecting the defendant's substantial rights because the district court never expressed an intention to lengthen the sentence for rehabilitative purposes. Similarly, in United States v. Pickar, 666 F.3d 1167, the court determined that the district court's lengthy explanation made clear that the need to protect the public from a dangerous recidivist and to deter the offender from committing the crime were the dominant factors in the court's analysis.

In contrast, in United States v. Starks, the court found that the district court's sentence was substantively unreasonable because the court considered an improper factor in varying upward from the Guidelines range. The court held that the sentence was lengthened because of the defendant's consistent and violent criminal history, as well as his needs for alcohol problems and mental health treatment.

In conclusion, while the courts have established guidelines for sentencing and rehabilitation, the determination of a substantively reasonable sentence ultimately depends on the specific circumstances of the case. <answer>

citations: ['564 U.S. 319', '564 U.S. 319', '662 F.3d 981', '406 F.3d 543', '666 F.3d 1167']

gold_text: Starks also alleges that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court impermissibly based its upward variance on the need to address Starks’s alcohol-treatment and mental-health needs, in violation of Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). Because Starks did not object on this basis before the district court, we review for plain error, under which “the defendant must show: (1) an error; (2) that is plain; and (3) that affects' substantial rights.” United States v. Blackmon, 662 F.3d 981, 986 (8th Cir. 2011). The district court justified the sentence based on Starks’s “consistent and violent criminal history,” as well as the need to protect his family and the public from the danger he poses by possessing a firearm. The district court then noted that its sentence was “also to address his needs for his alcohol problems and perhaps his mental health needs.” We acknowledge that the district court’s statement can be read as going beyond merely “discussing the opportunities for rehabilitation within prison,” id. at 987 (quoting Tapia, 564 U.S. at 334, 131 S.Ct. 2382), and we are reminded that Tapia forecloses district courts from imposing or lengthening a sentence to promote rehabilitation or facilitate a defendant’s participation in a treatment program. Nevertheless, assuming that the district court erroneously considered Starks’s needs for alcohol and mental-health treatment in imposing the sentence, Starks has not shown that he would have received a different sentence absent such error. See id. at 987 (“[W]here the effect of the error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate—where we would have to speculate—the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error.” (quoting United States v. Pirani, 406 F.3d 543, 553 (8th Cir. 2005) (en banc))); see also United States v. Pickar, 666 F.3d 1167, 1169-70 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Blackmon and holding no plain error in part because proper sentencing factors were dominant). Having failed to show that any error affected his substantial rights, Starks has thus not shown plain error.
