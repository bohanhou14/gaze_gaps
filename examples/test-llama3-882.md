Based on the reference cases, we can analyze the legal issues presented in the case. The first issue is whether the district court erred in imposing the enhancements. The court imposed a two-level enhancement because the offense involved three or more firearms, a two-level enhancement because McGee used a minor to aid in committing the offense, and a four-level enhancement because he committed the offense in connection with another felony offense.

The court's findings on these enhancements are supported by the evidence. The testimony of Amber Andrews, a witness who was present at the scene of the crime, was credible and corroborated by the physical evidence. The court did not err in relying on Andrews' testimony, as it was not clearly erroneous. United States v. Maid, 772 F.3d 1118 (8th Cir. 2014).

The second issue is whether the district court abused its discretion in granting the government's request for a continuance. The court granted the continuance to allow Andrews to appear at the resentencing hearing, which was necessary to ensure that the defense had the opportunity to cross-examine her regarding the newly discovered evidence.

The court's decision to grant the continuance was not an abuse of discretion, as it was a reasonable and necessary step to ensure a fair trial. United States v. Johnson, 535 F.3d 892, 898 (8th Cir. 2008).

The third issue is whether the district court erred in increasing McGee's base offense level to 22. The court increased the base offense level based on McGee's prior conviction for Assault While Displaying a Dangerous Weapon, which was a felony offense punishable by more than a year in prison.

The court's determination that the prior conviction was a violent felony is supported by the evidence. The Iowa statutes governing assault and the use of dangerous weapons provide that a person who commits an assault and uses or displays a dangerous weapon in connection with the assault is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor. Iowa Code § 708.2(3). The court did not err in increasing McGee's base offense level to 22, as the prior conviction was a violent felony. United States v. Garcia-Longoria, 819 F.3d 1063, 1065 (8th Cir. 2016).

In conclusion, the district court did not err in imposing the enhancements, granting the government's request for a continuance, or increasing McGee's base offense level

gold_text: In United States v. Maid, 772 F.3d 1118 (8th Cir. 2014), and again in United States v. Boots, 816 F.3d 971 (8th Cir. 2016), we held that convictions for Assault While Displaying a Dangerous Weapon under Iowa Code §§ 708.1 & 708.2(3) "categorically qualified as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)(1)." 816 F.3d at 974. We explained that intentionally pointing a firearm at another person and displaying a dangerous weapon toward another in a threatening manner constitute, categorically, "a 'threatened use of physical force' under USSG § 4B1.2(a)(1)." Maid, 772 F.3d at 1121.
