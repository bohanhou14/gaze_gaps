The recent reference cases cite that an appeal is frivolous if the result is obvious or the arguments are “wholly without merit” (Westcott Constr. Corp. v. Firemen’s Fund of N.J., 996 F.2d 14). Additionally, an appeal is considered frivolous when the appellees can demonstrate that the appellants and their attorney should have been aware that the appeal had no chance of success (E.H. Ashley & Co., Inc. v. Wells Fargo Alarm Servs., 907 F.2d 1274). In the case of Roger Edwards, LLC v. Fiddes & Son, Ltd., the court found that the filing of the Rule 60(b) motion was hopelessly frivolous and unreasonable (Roger Edwards II, 427 F.3d 131). The motion was based on a double proposition, including allegations of mislabeled products and misrepresentations made by Fiddes and its counsel. However, the court found that the allegations were weak and lacked any plausible showing of prejudice (Roger Edwards II, 427 F.3d 135-37).

Furthermore, the court ruled that the motion was frivolous because it was not supported by any evidence or legal authority, and the appellants failed to articulate any reasoned basis for why the district court erroneously dismissed the § 1985(3) count (Roger Edwards I, 387 F.3d 92-94). The court also noted that the appellants had engaged in repeated frivolous appeals, requiring the appellees to litigate the same claim in different forums, and that the appellants had failed to articulate any plausible argument for why the claims were not properly brought (Roger Edwards II, 427 F.3d 131-32).

In light of these cases, it is clear that the appeal in this case is frivolous and without merit. The appellants should have been aware that the appeal had no chance of success, and the arguments presented are wholly without merit. The court should award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee under Fed.R.App.P. 38.
