Based on the provided references, it appears that the case involves an alien, Leon Damaso Duran-Quiroz, who is seeking review of the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA's) final order of removal. The BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge's (IJ's) denial of Duran-Quiroz's applications for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT), and cancellation of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). 

In reviewing the IJ's adverse credibility determination, the court must apply the "highly deferential" substantial-evidence test and determine whether the record compels a reversal of the administrative findings. As mentioned in Forgue v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 401 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir.2005), an alien may qualify for asylum by showing either past persecution based on a protected ground or a "well-founded fear" that he will be persecuted based on a protected ground. The alien bears the burden of establishing asylum eligibility by offering "credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record." 

In this case, the IJ and BIA made a clean adverse credibility determination, pointing to discrepancies between Duran-Quiroz's asylum application and his testimony, as well as his inability to provide specific details about his detention, torture, and military service. The court noted that the IJ and BIA were permitted to discredit Duran-Quiroz's testimony that the lawyer who prepared his asylum application incorrectly transcribed his statements, as there was no other evidence in the record that sufficiently explained this discrepancy. 

The court also pointed out that Duran-Quiroz did not present any corroborating evidence other than three affidavits from his sisters, which did not explain how the sisters obtained the information or whether they had personal knowledge of the events in question. The court concluded that substantial evidence supported the IJ's and BIA's conclusion that Duran-Quiroz is ineligible for asylum on the basis of an adverse credibility determination and the insufficiency of corroborating evidence. 

In light of the above, it appears that the court's decision is consistent with the principles established in cases such as 463 F.3d 1247 and 328 F.3d 1320, which emphasize the importance of credibility determinations and the need for substantial evidence to support an alien's claim for asylum.

gold_text: On appeal, Duran-Quiroz argues for the first time that the Supreme Court’s decision in Vartelas v. Holder, — U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1479, 182 L.Ed.2d 473 (2012) invalidates the IJ’s and BIA’s finding that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal. We review our subject-matter jurisdiction de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). In a petition for review, we generally only have jurisdiction to consider claims that have been administratively exhausted. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1); Sundar v. I.N.S., 328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, we generally lack jurisdiction to review claims not raised before the BIA. Amaya-Artunduaga, 463 F.3d at 1250. Although some claims may not require exhaustion because the BIA does not have the power to adjudicate those claims, where the BIA can remedy a claim, the exhaustion requirement applies with full force. See Sundar, 328 F.3d at 1325.
