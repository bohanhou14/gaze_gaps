We affirm the district court's rejection of Zevallos's claim that Treasury's denial of his delisting request was arbitrary and capricious. Treasury relied on five different sets of evidence, including newspaper articles discussing the recent seizure of assets he continued to control in Panama, new charges filed against him in Peru, and his ongoing control of assets in Peru. Zevallos argues that this evidence is insufficient and that Treasury's determination was based on "unverified open source materials." However, as the court in Holy Land Found for Relief and Dev. v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 156, 162 (D.C.Cir. 2003) has held, "it is clear that the government may decide to designate an entity based on a broad range of evidence, including intelligence data and hearsay declarations."

Moreover, Zevallos's claim that Treasury's loss of the binders of evidence he submitted with his original delisting request in 2004 was a due process violation is also without merit. As the court in Islamic Am. Relief Agency v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 728, 732 (D.C.Cir.2007) has held, "we do not ask whether record evidence could support the petitioner's view of the issue, but whether it supports the agency's ultimate decision." In this case, the record supports Treasury's determination that Zevallos should remain designated as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker.

Zevallos also argues that Treasury's delay in deciding his request and failure to communicate with him during this time was a due process violation. However, as the court in Al Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. Gonzales, 686 F.3d 985, 984-85 (D.C.Cir.2012) has held, "extremely prolonged delays while considering such requests can violate the Due Process Clause" only if the agency fails to provide the requester with the unclassified administrative record justifying the designation or fails to communicate with the requester during the delay. In this case, Treasury provided Zevallos with the unclassified administrative record and allowed him to respond to it on multiple occasions.

Finally, Zevallos argues that Treasury's failure to disclose the basis for continuing to designate him until the final decision regarding his delisting request issued in 2013 was a due process violation. However, as the court in People's Mojahedin Org. of Iran v. U

gold_text: Finally, Zevallos insists that Treasury’s conduct violated his substantive due process rights. We have explained in the past that substantive due process forbids only “egregious government misconduct,” George Wash. Univ. v. District of Columbia, 318 F.3d 203, 209 (D.C.Cir. 2003), involving state officials guilty of “grave unfairness” so severe that it constitutes either “a substantial infringement of state law prompted by personal or group animus,” or “a deliberate flouting of the law that trammels significant personal or property rights,” Silverman v. Barry, 845 F.2d 1072, 1080 (D.C.Cir.1988). “Inadvertent errors, honest mistakes, agency confusion, even negligence in the performance of [official] duties, do not” violate substantive due process rights. Id. Zevallos has not suggested misconduct even approaching this egregious standard. Any error Treasury committed was, at most, the result of mistake or negligence and, as we have pointed out repeatedly, was harmless. Thus we affirm the district court on this score as well.
