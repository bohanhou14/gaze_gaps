The case at hand involves a bankruptcy trustee seeking to avoid preferential payments made by a debtor to a creditor. The creditor argues that the payments were made in the ordinary course of business and therefore should not be avoided. However, the court must consider whether the payments were preferential and whether they were made in the ordinary course of business.

The court has previously established that a payment is preferential if it was made to a creditor who had an existing claim against the debtor, and if it was made within 90 days of the debtor's bankruptcy petition. See 11 U.S.C. § 547(b). In this case, the payments were made to the creditor within the 90-day period, and the creditor had an existing claim against the debtor.

The court must also consider whether the payments were made in the ordinary course of business. The court has previously held that a payment is made in the ordinary course of business if it was made in accordance with the parties' existing credit agreement and if it was made in a reasonable and commercially reasonable manner. See In re Globe Holdings, Inc., 366 B.R. 186 (Bankr. N.D.Ala.2007). In this case, the payments were made in accordance with the parties' existing credit agreement, but the court must still consider whether they were made in a reasonable and commercially reasonable manner.

The court has previously considered similar issues in other cases. For example, in In re Cimmaron Oil Co., Inc. v. Cameron Consultants, Inc., 816 F.2d 1240 (5th Cir.1987), the court held that a payment was not made in the ordinary course of business if it was made in a way that was not commercially reasonable. See id. at 1244. Similarly, in In re Hechinger Inv. Co. of Del., Inc., 489 F.3d 568 (3rd Cir.2007), the court held that a payment was not made in the ordinary course of business if it was made in a way that was not commercially reasonable. See id. at 579-80.

In this case, the court must consider whether the payments were made in a commercially reasonable manner. The court has previously held that a payment is commercially reasonable if it was made in accordance with the parties' existing credit agreement and if it was made in a way that was not obviously unreasonable. See In re Globe Holdings, Inc., 366 B

gold_text: . Carrier also argues that the payments are not avoidable because the Bankruptcy Code provides that a Trustee may not avoid payments that “fix[] ... a statutory lien.” 11 U.S.C. § 547(c)(6). Carrier’s argument is briefed in the most cursory fashion, and is therefore waived. See, e.g., Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center v. Bowen, 815 F.2d 1435, 1446 n. 16 (11th Cir.1987). At any rate, the argument also lacks merit. Again, Carrier was not a statutory lienholder. Carrier appears to rely on Chumaron Oil Co. v. Cameron Consultants, Inc., 71 B.R. 1005, 1010 (N.D.Tex.1987), as authority for the proposition that federal bankruptcy law relieves it of the need to comply with state statutory procedures for perfecting its liens. (We say "appears” because, again, its brief is far from pellucid.) For the sake of completeness, therefore, we note that the Fifth Circuit has rejected Chumaron’s interpretation of Section 547(c)(6). See In re Ramba, Inc., 416 F.3d 394, 401 (5th Cir.2005). Were this issue properly raised, we would be inclined to reject this aspect of Chumaron as well.
