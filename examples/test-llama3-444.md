In the context of employment discrimination cases, the burden-shifting framework articulated by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) is often employed to analyze the evidence presented. This framework consists of three components: first, the plaintiff must make out a prima facie case of discrimination; second, the defendant must produce a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment action; and third, the plaintiff must show that the legitimate non-discriminatory reason proffered by the defendant is a pretext for discrimination.

In International Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 365-66, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1869-70, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977), the Court held that a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination with regard to the challenged employment action. In Lathram v. United States, 336 F.3d 1085, the court found that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination with regard to the Jones promotion, and therefore, summary judgment was appropriate.

In Hidalgo v. Overseas Condado Ins. Agencies, Inc., 156 F.3d 1284, the First Circuit assumed that an age-discrimination plaintiff had raised a triable issue as to whether the employer's explanation was incorrect, but concluded that because the plaintiff had "offered no evidence that reasonably could be construed to indicate that [the employer] intended to discriminate against him because of his age," it was appropriate to grant summary judgment for the defendant.

In this case, Ms. Jackson alleges that she was constructively discharged because of her race in violation of Title VII and the D.C. Human Rights Act. The District of Columbia argues that Ms. Jackson was demoted because she falsified her performance evaluation, not because she was African American. The court finds that no reasonable jury could find the District's asserted non-discriminatory reason for the demotion to have been a pretext for race discrimination.

gold_text: Adeyemi and Brady directly apply here because the District has asserted that Ms. Jackson was demoted because she falsified her 2001 performance evaluation. That constitutes a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for demoting Ms. Jackson. “At this point, to survive summary judgment the plaintiff must show that a reasonable jury could conclude from all of the evidence that the adverse employment decision was made for a discriminatory reason.” Lathram v. Snow, 336 F.3d 1085, 1088 (D.C.Cir.2003). “All of the evidence” includes evidence of the plaintiffs prima facie case, evidence showing the employer’s proffered reason to be false, and any other evidence of discrimination. See Aka v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr., 156 F.3d 1284, 1289 (D.C.Cir.1998); Czekalski, 475 F.3d at 364; Simpson v. Leavitt, 437 F.Supp.2d 95, 101 (D.D.C.2006).
