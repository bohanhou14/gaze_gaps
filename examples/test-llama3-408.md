The provided case involves a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action alleging constitutional claims by California state prisoner Joseph Nichols. The district court dismissed the action, and Nichols appeals. Upon review, we affirm the dismissal.

The district court properly dismissed Nichols' retaliation claims due to lack of sufficient factual allegations to support his conclusory allegations of retaliatory motive, as seen in Rhodes v. Robinson, 408 F.3d 559, 567-68 (9th Cir.2005). Similarly, the court properly dismissed Nichols' access-to-courts claims as he failed to allege an actual injury, as required in Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 349-53, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).

The district court also correctly dismissed Nichols' claim regarding the handling of his administrative grievances, as inmates are not entitled to a specific type of grievance process, as stated in Ramirez v. Galaza, 334 F.3d 850, 860 (9th Cir.2003). Furthermore, the court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Nichols' property claim without due process, as he had an adequate post-deprivation remedy under California law, as seen in Barnett v. Centoni, 31 F.3d 813, 816-17 (9th Cir.1994).

The district court's denial of Nichols' motion for appointment of counsel was also proper, as Nichols did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances, as required in Palmer v. Valdez, 560 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir.2009).

In conclusion, the district court's dismissal of Nichols' claims is affirmed, and his appeal is denied.
