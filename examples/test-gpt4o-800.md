**Generation:**

In defending its nondisclosure decision, ATF adhered to the legal precedents governing administrative actions. The principle established in *Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States*, 371 U.S. 156, dictates that an agency's action must be upheld based on the reasoning it has articulated and not on appellate rationalizations. Similarly, in *SEC v. Chenery Corp.*, 332 U.S. 194 (1947), the Supreme Court reinforced that agency decisions must stand on the grounds originally given by the agency itself. Additionally, as outlined in *American Textile Mfrs. Institute, Inc. v. Donovan*, 452 U.S. 490 (1981), an agency does not need to consider every conceivable policy alternative, aligning with the directives from *Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.*, 435 U.S. 519 (1978).

ATF's detailed consideration and partial disclosures demonstrate compliance with these precedents, ensuring their decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). CFI's arguments fail to surpass the deferential standard of review under the APA, further supported by *Burlington Truck Lines* and subsequent cases. Thus, the district court correctly affirmed ATF’s discretion in withholding certain evidence, maintaining the legitimacy of the agency's determinations in upholding law enforcement priorities without judicial overreach.

For these reasons, we uphold the district court’s summary judgment in favor of ATF, in line with well-established administrative law principles.
