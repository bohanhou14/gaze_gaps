 Here's a summary of the legal cases:

The cases discussed in this write-up are Reference Case 2 USCMA 306 and Reference Case 1 USCMA 201.

In Reference Case 2 USCMA 306, the court held that the law officer's failure to give instructions on the elements of lesser included offenses was error. The court pointed out that the law officer did not instruct the court on the elements of the lesser offenses of unpremeditated murder and voluntary manslaughter, despite the fact that the accused was found guilty of the greater offense. The court held that the error was prejudicial to the accused's substantial rights.

In Reference Case 1 USCMA 201, the court held that the law officer's failure to instruct on the elements of the offense of making and uttering bank checks was error. The court pointed out that the law officer did not instruct the court on the elements of the offense, including the requirement that the accused had knowledge of the regulation. The court held that the failure to instruct on this element of the offense was error and that the conviction under Charge II must be set aside.

In summary, both cases emphasize the importance of providing instructions on the elements of the offense and lesser included offenses to ensure that the accused is protected from prejudice and receives a fair trial. The cases also highlight the need for law officers to provide accurate and complete instructions to the court, and for courts to carefully consider the instructions given by law officers when determining the guilt or innocence of an accused.

gold_text: Did the failure of the law officer to instruct on the elements of' the lesser offenses constitute error? We have — on occasions without number — held that instructions as to lesser offenses need be given only where the lesser offense or offenses are fairly raised by the evidence adduced at the trial as reasonable alternatives to that charged. United States v. Miller, 2 USCMA 194, 7 CMR 70. In this case, from the factual conclusions of the court-martial and the board of review to the effect that accused had possessed no intention to deceive and no intention at the time of issuance not to maintain a sufficient balance in'his account, it seems clear beyond peradventure that the lesser offenses not involving those elements, and of which accused now stands convicted, were fairly raised as reasonable alternatives to those charged. Indeed, we hold that they were. The law officer’s dereliction was, therefore, error. However, since the lesser offenses of which the accused stands convicted were the only alternatives raised to the offenses charged, whatever prejudice resulted to the accused from the law officer’s instructional omissions in this particular, has been removed by the action of the court-martial and the board of review. United States v. Baguex, 2 USCMA 306, 8 CMR 106; see United States v. Simmons, supra. The present case is not, we believe, within the principle of United States v. Clark, 1 USCMA 201, 2 CMR 107.
