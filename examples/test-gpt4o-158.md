**Generation:**

In this case, the district court's analysis allowing Franklin to allege deliberate indifference based on the Supervisory Defendants' "knew or should have known" falls short of the deliberate indifference standard, as reinforced by precedent. The Supreme Court in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, clarified that mere legal conclusions, such as those presented by Franklin, are insufficient for a plausible claim. Similar to the plaintiffs in Twombly, the conclusory allegations about the Supervisory Defendants' awareness and actions do not meet the plausibility threshold required for a cognizable claim.

Moreover, the appellate court in 654 F.3d 1148 reiterated that legal conclusions without adequate factual support do not satisfy the pleading standards, emphasizing that formulaic recitations lacking in specific factual basis cannot survive a motion to dismiss. Franklin’s allegations echo these shortcomings by offering bare assertions without substantial supporting facts, thus failing the standard established in Iqbal and Twombly.

Therefore, applying the scrutiny from Iqbal and 654 F.3d 1148, we conclude that Franklin's complaint, stripped of its conclusory statements, lacks necessary factual content to plausibly suggest deliberate indifference by the Supervisory Defendants. This deficiency warrants reversing the district court’s denial of the Appellants' motion to dismiss, affirming their entitlement to qualified immunity.
