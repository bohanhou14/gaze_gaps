The district court awarded Oiness 8% prejudgment interest on the entire judgment. In General Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp., 461 U.S. 648, 103 S.Ct. 2058, 76 L.Ed.2d 211, 217 USPQ 1185 (1983), the Supreme Court held that prejudgment interest should ordinarily be awarded absent some justification for withholding such an award. However, in this case, the award of prejudgment interest is not supported by the evidence. Oiness failed to provide evidence of the reasonable royalty rate or the actual damages it incurred due to Walgreen's infringement. As a result, the award of prejudgment interest is speculative and lacks a factual basis.

In Trio Process Corp. v. L. Goldstein's Sons, Inc., 638 F.2d 661 (3d Cir.1981), the court held that prejudgment interest could not be assessed on a punitively enhanced portion of damages. Similarly, in the instant case, the award of prejudgment interest on the entire judgment lacks a factual basis and is therefore inappropriate.

Accordingly, this court reverses the award of prejudgment interest and sends the case back to the district court for reconsideration of the interest component of the judgment. Oiness should be given the opportunity to provide evidence of the reasonable royalty rate or actual damages it incurred due to Walgreen's infringement, and the district court should then calculate the interest component of the judgment based on that evidence.
