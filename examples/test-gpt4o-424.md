In Lucidore v. New York State Div. of Parole, 209 F.3d 107 (2d Cir. 2000), the court upheld the constitutionality of AEDPA’s one-year statute of limitations, ruling that it does not inherently violate the Suspension Clause. This decision aligns with our analysis. The court concluded that AEDPA’s limitations period does not render the habeas remedy "inadequate or ineffective" because it provides petitioners with a reasonable opportunity to be heard on the merits.

Similarly, in Miller v. Marr, 177 F.3d 390 (10th Cir. 1998), the court rejected the argument that AEDPA’s limitations period violates the Suspension Clause. The court held that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that the one-year period resulted in the inadequacy and ineffectiveness of the habeas remedy. 

Moreover, in Calderon v. United States District Court (Kelly), 128 F.3d 1283 (9th Cir. 1997), the court ruled that the one-year statute of limitations under AEDPA is subject to equitable tolling but this did not justify the petitioner’s delay. The equitable tolling doctrine applies only under extraordinary circumstances, which were not present in Green's case.

Therefore, AEDPA’s one-year limitation, as applied to Green’s petition, does not amount to an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus and does not justify equitable tolling based on the precedents discussed.

gold_text: The one-year limitation does not violate the Suspension Clause because it is not jurisdictional and may be subject to equitable tolling. See Lucidore v. New York State Div. of Parole, 209 F.3d 107, 113 (2d Cir.2000) (concluding that “because AED-PA’s one-year statute of limitations leaves habeas petitioners with some reasonable opportunity to have their claims heard on the merits,” it does not constitute a per se violation of the Suspension Clause), petition for cert, filed, 69 U.S.L.W. 3086 (U.S. July 5, 2000); Turner v. Johnson, 177 F.3d 390, 392-93 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, - U.S. -, 120 S.Ct. 504, 145 L.Ed.2d 389 (1999); Miller v. Marr, 141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998). “The one-year time period begins to run in accordance with individual circumstances that could reasonably affect the availability of the remedy, but requires inmates to diligently pursue claims.” Miller, 141 F.3d at 978 (internal citations omitted) (citing Calderon v. United States District Court, 128 F.3d 1283, 1289 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc)). We therefore hold that the one-year limitation does not per se render the writ of habeas corpus inadequate or ineffective.
