In the referenced cases, the court has established that administrative expenses incurred in a Chapter 7 case have priority over those incurred in a Chapter 11 case. In In re Pennsylvania Tire & Rubber Company of Mississippi, Inc. (Bkrtcy.N.D.Ohio 1980) 19 B.R. 124, the court held that when a Chapter 11 proceeding for reorganization aborts and straight bankruptcy for liquidation ensues, the administration expenses in the Chapter 7 liquidation are entitled to priority of payment over those incurred under Chapter 11. (Reference case 19 B.R. 462)

In the present case, the law firms of Stennett, Wilkinson, and Ward and Knight and Knight have filed fee applications for compensation and reimbursement of expenses incurred in the bankruptcy case. The court has reviewed the fee applications and approved certain amounts as reasonable and necessary. The court has also considered the security interests established by the law firms in the retainers and has determined that the amounts approved as compensation are secured by the retainers. (Reference case 18 B.R. 292)

The court has considered the Mississippi Statute of Frauds and has determined that the retainer obtained by Stennett, Wilkinson, and Ward does not violate or conflict with the statute. However, the court has determined that parts of the attorneys’ fees and expenses allowed by the court for Knight and Knight were earned and incurred more than fifteen months after the law firm had obtained its retainer and therefore cannot be considered as secured by the retainer. (Reference case 28 B.R. 766)

The court has also considered the provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 726(b) and has determined that the Chapter 7 administrative expenses incurred by the law firms have priority over the Chapter 11 administrative expenses. (Reference case 32 B.R. 629)

Based on the above analysis, the court hereby orders that the amounts approved as compensation by the court are secured by the retainers and that the law firms shall have priority over the Chapter 11 administrative expenses. The court further orders that the law firms shall refund to the bankruptcy estate the balance of the Knight and Knight retainer, which was earned and incurred more than fifteen months after the law firm had obtained its retainer.
