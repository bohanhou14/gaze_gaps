The legal framework supporting this decision is corroborated by prior case law and statutory interpretation. For instance, in the reference case In re SeSide Co., 152 B.R. 878, it is clarified that a mortgagee's right to rents remains valid and enforceable against third parties, even if the mortgagee has not yet acted on this right. Consistent with the principle set forth in Collier Real Estate Transactions and the Bankruptcy Code, a mortgagee's lien in rents and profits attaches and is perfected at the moment of execution, delivery, and recordation of the instrument (5 F.3d 34). Thus, these principles affirm that mortgagee's rights in rents are preserved so long as the necessary steps are taken to enforce this right, rendering the lien valid and enforceable (5 F.3d 34).

Furthermore, under Pennsylvania law, the recordation of a rent assignment along with the underlying mortgage places third parties on notice of the mortgagee's security interest in both the property and its rents (152 B.R. 878). Therefore, the tipping fees here, being neither "rents" nor "profits" stemming from the soil but rather business receipts from landfill operations, cannot constitute cash collateral as stipulated under 11 U.S.C. §§ 363(a) and 552(b).

This conclusion aligns with the decision in In re Bristol Assocs., Inc., which recognizes that an assignment of rents does not equate to business earnings, reinforcing the notion that the tipping fees in question remain personal property (505 F.2d 1056, 1061). Therefore, based on a synthesis of these rulings, DiFrancesco's Motion to Prohibit the Use of Cash Collateral is denied.
