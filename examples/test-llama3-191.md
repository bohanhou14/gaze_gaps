The case at hand involves the valuation of an annuity received by Mr. and Mrs. Schultz in exchange for their properties. The Commissioner determined the value of the annuity to be $169,603.56, while the petitioners valued it at $225,000. The petitioners claimed that the Commissioner's valuation was arbitrary and unreasonable, citing Rev. Rul. 62-137, which provides that certain annuities may be valued by reference to the values of commercial annuities. However, the Commissioner's valuation was based on the actuarial tables in section 20.2031-7(f) of the Estate Tax Regulations.

Following the reasoning in Estate of Bell v. Commissioner, 60 T.C. 469 (1973), we find that the Commissioner's use of the actuarial tables in valuing the annuity is presumptively correct. The petitioners have the burden of proving that the use of such tables was arbitrary and unreasonable, but they have presented no evidence to support their claim. Therefore, we sustain the Commissioner's determination that the value of the annuity was $169,603.56.

Regarding the valuation of the properties, the Commissioner's appraisals were based on the real estate appraisers' reports, which indicated a value of $124,500. The petitioners claimed that the value of the properties was higher, citing the real estate appraisers' reports that indicated a value of $205,000 for the 18th Street property and $35,000 for the 12th Street property. However, the Commissioner's valuation was based on the fair market value of the properties, which is defined as the price at which property would change hands in a transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under a compulsion to buy or sell and both being reasonably informed as to all relevant facts. Alvary v. United States, 302 F.2d 790, 794 (2d Cir. 1962).

In this case, the Commissioner's valuation of the properties is supported by the real estate appraisers' reports, and we find that the value of the properties is reasonable. Therefore, we sustain the Commissioner's determination that the value of the properties is $124,500.

In conclusion, we find that the Commissioner's determinations regarding the value of the annuity and the properties are reasonable and supported by the evidence. Therefore, we sustain the Commissioner

gold_text: The petitioners argue that the parties agreed upon a value of $225,000 for the properties and that this Court is bound to respect the value contractually agreed upon by the parties and fixed by them as the selling price of the properties.
