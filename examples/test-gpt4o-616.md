In determining whether the employees of Centralized Services, Inc. are covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act, it is essential to consider the extent to which their activities are engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce. As established in Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517, coverage is determined by whether employees are engaged in activities that are part of an overall process of production leading to commerce (328 U.S. 108). Here, the preparation of tax returns for clients, including their ultimate mailing to the Internal Revenue Service in Georgia, constitutes participation in activities significantly tied to interstate commerce.

Moreover, in cases like Tilbury v. Rogers, as referenced in 372 F.2d 143, the consistent and regular provision of services across state lines reinforces the engagement in commerce. The Defense contends that merely preparing tax returns destined for out-of-state mailing does not meet this threshold. However, it was held in Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 317 U.S. 564, 572, that activities reasonably expected to result in goods or services moving in commerce are within the scope of the Act.

Furthermore, the joint employment claim involving Mrs. Joan McCall needs to be analyzed under criteria set forth in A.B. Kirschbaum v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517, 62 S.Ct. 1116. The evidence suggests separate and distinct employment by Centralized Services and M & J Machine Shop, as her work for one did not benefit the other, thereby lacking the mutuality indicative of joint employment (372 F.2d 143).

In light of these considerations, particularly under the authoritative guidance of prior jurisprudence, the determination of liability for back wages hinges on detailed factual analysis and further proceedings might be necessary to ascertain precise liabilities for periods under review.
