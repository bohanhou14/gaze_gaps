Although the case primarily concerns the application of Ill.Rev.Stats. Ch. 38, § 28-1(a) (10) with respect to the First Amendment, reference cases such as 393 U.S. 410 and 378 U.S. 108 provide critical insights into the broader constitutional issues. In 393 U.S. 410, the principle of assessing the warrant's probable cause was significantly expounded, clarifying that judicial interpretation must comply strictly with constitutional safeguards to prevent unwarranted intrusions, paralleling the need to meticulously judge the circumstances surrounding Angelini's activities.

Moreover, in 378 U.S. 108, the Court emphasized the necessity of specific, credible evidence in affidavits supporting warrant issuance, which directly relates to the rigorous need for factual substantiation in judicial scrutiny of Angelini's operations. Applying these precedents ensures a balanced approach in upholding statutory mandates while respecting constitutional freedoms. 

Thus, the dissemination of information, when contextualized within professional gambling, warrants regulation without inherently infringing upon constitutional rights. Both referenced cases underscore the importance of calibrated judicial processes in maintaining the delicate balance between law enforcement prerogatives and protected freedoms.
