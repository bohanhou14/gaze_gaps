**Generation:**

In affirming the trial court's judgment, we draw upon principles established in the referenced legal precedents. As in McAllister v. United States, 348 U.S. 19, we recognize the significance of expert testimony and trial court findings when supported by substantial evidence. Here, the trial court's determination that both vessels were at fault is grounded in sound reasoning and factual evidence, much like in the polio infection case, where the District Court's findings were upheld despite uncertainties.

Furthermore, in alignment with United States v. Glidden Co., 235 F.2d 741, we accept the trial court's findings unless clearly erroneous. The trial courtâ€™s decision, based on extensive evidence and testimonies, demonstrated that the Velma Lykes violated the rule of special circumstance by failing to reduce speed for imminent collision risks. Similarly, the Anita D neglected her duty to navigate with caution given the potential for the Velma Lykes to alter her course towards the Houston Ship Channel.

Thus, consistent with judicial deference to trial courts in fact-finding as underscored in the aforementioned cases, we affirm the decision that both vessels share fault in the incident due to their failure to adhere to prudent navigational conduct under special circumstances.

Affirmed.
