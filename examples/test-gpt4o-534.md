However, the Supreme Court has previously asserted that state regulations that interfere with federal labor laws must yield to federal authority. In Garmon (359 U.S. 236), the Court established that state laws regulating activities arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA must defer to federal jurisdiction. Additionally, the legality of state intervention in union activities, particularly when involving picketing on private property, has been scrutinized for its alignment with federal statutes. In Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Carpenters (436 U.S. 180), the Court highlighted the complexities of when and how state laws, such as those concerning trespass, could apply without encroaching on federally protected labor activities.

Furthermore, Reeves, Inc. v. Stake (356 U.S. 634) informs our examination of the Striker Replacement Law's preemption. In that case, the Supreme Court examined the extent to which state statutes could limit organizational representation and activities without conflicting with federal labor regulations. Similarly, Minnesota's Striker Replacement Law seeks to impose additional requirements on employers that federal law does not, thereby disrupting the balance and protections intended by the NLRA.

In conclusion, Minnesota’s Striker Replacement Law conflicts with federal labor law as it creates undue interference and additional obligations that the NLRA does not impose, thus it is preempted and unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause.

gold_text: The Court, however, cannot uphold the means by which the State has attempted to achieve this laudable purpose. The Striker Replacement Law does not selectively address the right of an employee, an employer, or the State to redress picket line violénce. See Youngdahl, 355 U.S. at 139, 78 S.Ct. at 211 (employer entitled to enjoin picket line violence, but may not enjoin peaceful picketing); Int’l Union, United Auto., Aircraft & Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW-CIO) v. Russell, 356 U.S. 634, 642, 78 S.Ct. 932, 937, 2 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1958) (non-union employee may recover damages caused by tortious conduct of union strikers on picket line). Instead, the State’s blanket prohibition of hiring permanent striker replacements directly interferes with an employer’s fedérally protected right to do so. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. San Diego Dist. Council of Carpenters, 436 U.S. 180, 196, 98 S.Ct. 1745, 1757, 56 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978). The State’s attempt to avoid picket line violence by a blunderbuss prohibition of a practice which has been protected by over fifty years of Supreme Court precedent cannot stand. This is not a State adjustment of a locally sensitive relationship. It is instead a reweaving of a critical thread in the fabric of labor-management relations. Under the broadly preemptive power of the NLRA, the State is simply without authority to introduce its own standard of “properly balanced bargaining power.” Machinists, 427 U.S. at 149-150, 96 S.Ct. at 2557-58. While Minnesota is certainly entitled to be concerned over picket line safety, this concern is too generalized to permit the State to unilaterally redefine federal labor law.
