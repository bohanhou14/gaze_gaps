VIII. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND HEIGHTENED PLEADING STANDARD

When defendants raise the defense of qualified immunity, plaintiffs are required to meet a heightened pleading standard. According to Breidenbach v. Bolish, 126 F.3d 1288, 1292 (10th Cir.1997) and Sawyer v. County of Creek, 908 F.2d 663, 667 (10th Cir.1990), plaintiffs must do more than assert bare allegations of a constitutional violation. They must provide specific and non-conclusory factual allegations sufficient to sustain a conclusion that the defendant violated clearly established law (242 F.3d 905).

In this case, Karen and Renee Demster have asserted that Officers Trevino, Velasquez, Flack, and McCormack made intentional false statements in police reports, leading to their malicious prosecution. The specificity of these allegations aligns with the heightened requirement noted in Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574 (1998), where plaintiffs are obligated to offer detailed factual allegations showing an improper motive causing a cognizable injury to overcome a motion to dismiss.

IX. MOTION TO AMEND

Plaintiffs request leave to amend their complaint to bolster their false arrest claim. However, given the court’s finding that the officers are shielded by qualified immunity, additional factual allegations would not alter this conclusion. As such, the court follows the rationale applied in Bauchman’s motion to amend (132 F.3d 542), where additional allegations would not impact the ultimate decision.

Consequently, the court denies the plaintiffs' request for leave to amend their complaint on the false arrest claim.

VIII. CONCLUSION

Based on the aforementioned detailed analysis, the court grants in part and denies in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss as described above, thereby advancing some claims and shielding others under the doctrine of qualified immunity.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
LUNGSTRUM, District Judge.

gold_text: Karen and Renee Demster argue that if the court believes they have not pled sufficient specific, non-conclusory allegations of fact to allow the district court to determine whether or not defendants are entitled to qualified immunity for plaintiffs’ false arrest claim, plaintiffs should be able to amend their complaint, citing Dill v. City of Edmond, 155 F.3d 1193, 1204 (10th Cir.1998) and Watson v. City of Kansas City, Kansas, 80 F.Supp.2d 1175, 1185 (D.Kan.1999). These cases, however, took place under a heightened pleading requirement formerly in place in the Tenth Circuit in cases where there was a qualified immunity defense, and the Tenth Circuit expressly stated in Currier v. Doran, 242 F.3d 905 (10th Cir.2001) that such a standard is no longer permissible as a result of Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998). As heightened pleading is no longer required, there remains no justification for allowing leave to amend as a matter of course in cases where qualified immunity is asserted as a defense. Moreover, even under a conventional discretionary standard, this is not a case where leave to amend should be granted. Here, Karen and Renee Dem-ster clearly state that they had to be restrained from approaching Stanley Dem-ster. This is the act which is analyzed while looking at defendants’ qualified im munity defense, and there are not any additional facts that plaintiffs could plead to defeat that defense. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) (leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires, unless the amendment would be futile); see Bauchman ex rel. Bauchman v. West High Sch., 132 F.3d 542, 559 (10th Cir.1997). The court, therefore, denies plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend.
