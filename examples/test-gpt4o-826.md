In addressing the jurisdictional amount requirement, the principles outlined in reference cases 303 U.S. 283 and 367 U.S. 348 are particularly instructive. According to 303 U.S. 283, the sum claimed by the plaintiff controls if the claim is made in good faith unless it is apparent to a legal certainty that the claim is for less than the jurisdictional amount. It is also well-settled that events occurring subsequent to the filing, which reduce the amount recoverable, do not oust jurisdiction. Moreover, as emphasized in 367 U.S. 348, the amount in controversy is typically determined from the complaint itself unless the stated amount is clearly not claimed in good faith.

Applying these principles, the plaintiff claims damages totaling $11,950.00, which includes the alleged value of the franchise, loss of profits, and the value of stock at termination. The defendant's attempt to revalue the franchise at $3,200.00, thereby reducing the aggregate claim to $8,750.00, does not conclusively establish the lack of good faith or alter the initial jurisdictional basis, as per the guidance from reference cases. Therefore, the plaintiff's claim meets the jurisdictional threshold, and the motion to dismiss on this ground is unwarranted.

In light of the above discussion and consistent with federal jurisprudence, the defendant's motion to dismiss for want of jurisdictional amount is denied.

SO ORDERED.

gold_text: Although it is unnecessary, under the federal rules, to state with any degree of specificity the circumstances underlying oneâ€™s cause of action, of the exact amount in controversy, where it appears to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount the complaint must be dismissed. St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Company, 303 U.S. 283, 289, 58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938); Horton v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, 367 U.S. 348, 81 S.Ct. 1570, 6 L.Ed. 2d 890 (1961). The plaintiff argues that the claim for unlawful infringement may itself exceed the jurisdictional requirements of this Court. He asserts, however, that inasmuch as the records are all within the control of the defendant, it is impossible to establish with any degree of certainty the actual amount to which he is entitled.
