In the context of patent infringement, the concept of obviousness is crucial in determining the validity of a patent. The court needs to consider whether a person of ordinary skill in the field would have arrived at the claimed invention without resorting to inventive ingenuity. In the case of Anderson's patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.

In the reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court held that the patent in question did not meet the requirements of patentability because it was obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field. Similarly, in the reference case 106 F.2d 554, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.

In the case of Anderson's patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious because it was a combination of old elements that were well-known in the field. The court noted that the prior art references, such as the Thompson and Lampe patents, showed that the simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder was already known. The court also noted that the use of a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid was also known in the prior art.

Furthermore, the court found that the claimed invention did not have any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements. The court noted that the materials used in the prior art references did not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics, but the court still found that the prior art references were relevant to the issue of obviousness.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Anderson's patents was influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The court's finding of obviousness was based on the combination of old elements that were well-known in the field, and the court did not find any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements.

gold_text: Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No. 2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise. The method and apparatus claimed by claim 11 of Anderson ’314 “would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * * ” (35 U.S.C.A. § 103) upon perceiving that the strand roving fell to the ground when the operator stopped the machine. “[I]t is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result.” Application of Demarche, 219 F.2d 952, 955, 42 CCPA 793 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 1955). Again, our conclusions in this regard are influenced by the fact that so little time elapsed between the introduction of roving in strands and the application for Anderson’s main patent. Compare Forestek Plating & Mfg. Co. v. Knapp-Monarch Co., 106 F.2d 554, 557 (6 Cir. 1939) (validity of improvement patent upheld in light of prior, repeated unsuccessful efforts).
