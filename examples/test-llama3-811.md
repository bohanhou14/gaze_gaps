In the case of Cardoso v. Robert Bosch Corporation, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Bosch, finding that Cardoso's claims of national origin discrimination were time-barred. However, even if we assume that Cardoso's claims are not time-barred, his case does not succeed on the merits.

Cardoso's claims arise under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's national origin. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).

Cardoso claims that he was more qualified than his fellow buyers and senior buyers, yet he started at a lower salary than they did and did not receive a comparable raise. He also claims that Bosch's facially neutral explanations for the pay disparities are pretextual.

In contrast, Bosch offered legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for the pay disparities, including the incoming employee's skills, experience, education, and work performance. These proffered reasons are perfectly consistent with the evidence regarding the starting salaries and raises of Cardoso and his fellow buyers.

The district court correctly concluded that Cardoso's claims are time-barred, and therefore, we affirm the district court's judgment. See Morgan, 536 U.S. at 122-23, 122 S.Ct. 2061. Even if we assume that Cardoso's claims are not time-barred, his case does not succeed on the merits. See Davis, 368 F.3d at 784.

In conclusion, the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Bosch, and we affirm the district court's judgment. See Ghosh, 192 F.3d at 1091.

gold_text: Perhaps Cardoso’s many self-described talents tvere objectively more valuable to Bosch, and he was underpaid because the company was exercising poor business judgment in not recognizing that fact and paying him accordingly. That determination, however, is not for us to make, and we will not second-guess Bosch’s management decisions so long as they do not run afoul of Title VII. As we have often stated—to a host of deaf ears, it often seems— the court is not a “super-personnel department” intervening whenever an employee feels he is being treated unjustly. See Davis, 368 F.3d at 785 (citation omitted); Guerrero v. Ashcroft, 253 F.3d 309, 314 (7th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). The aggrieved employee may seek recourse in federal court for discrimination only for the forbidden reasons set forth in Title VII, not for common workplace disputes or poor, nonsensical, or even heavy-handed management techniques or decisions. See, e.g., Guerrero, 253 F.3d at 314 (“[W]e may not punish an employer for choices that constitute business decisions alone, no matter how unwise or mistaken they may seem to us.”) (collecting authority). Nor does Title VII empower us to impose court-enforced merit selection or recognition programs. Cf. Jordan v. Summers, 205 F.3d 337, 344 (7th Cir.2000).
