The case at hand involves a dispute between Distillers and the Department of Energy (DOE) regarding the interpretation of Subpart K of the Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations. Distillers and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hydrocarbons, filed a complaint in the district court, alleging that venue was proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(4). However, DOE argues that the joinder of Hydrocarbons was collusive and was made solely to obtain venue in the district.

In evaluating this issue, the court must consider the principles established in 28 U.S.C. § 1359, which prohibits the manufacturing of jurisdiction by collusive joinder of parties. Similarly, the court must also consider the policy favoring strict application of § 1359, as discussed in Green and White Construction Co. v. Cormat Construction Co., 361 F.Supp. 125 (N.D.Ill.1973). In this case, the court finds that the joinder of Hydrocarbons was collusive and was made solely to obtain venue in the district.

As stated in 546 F.2d 469, where a non-diverse parent corporation assigns a claim to its wholly-owned diverse subsidiary engaged in no business other than the prosecution of that claim, the assignment must be treated as presumptively improper and as having been undertaken for the purpose of attempting to manufacture diversity jurisdiction. In this case, the assignment of the claim to Hydrocarbons can be inferred to have been made solely for the purpose of obtaining venue in the district.

Therefore, the court concludes that venue is not properly founded in this case due to the collusive joinder of Hydrocarbons as a co-plaintiff. The court finds that the joinder was made solely to obtain venue in the district and was not based on any legitimate business purpose.

In reaching this conclusion, the court is guided by the principles established in 211 U.S. 293, which holds that where a non-diverse parent corporation assigns a claim to its wholly-owned diverse subsidiary engaged in no business other than the prosecution of that claim, the assignment must be treated as presumptively improper and as having been undertaken for the purpose of attempting to manufacture diversity jurisdiction.

gold_text: In Miller and Lux v. East Side Canal Co., 211 U.S. 293, 29 S.Ct. 111, 53 L.Ed. 189 (1908) the Supreme Court held that a predecessor statute to section 1359 precluded the district court from exercising jurisdiction because the plaintiff corporation had been collusively made a party to the action by means of a transfer of property to it by its parent corporation. The Court’s holding was based on the fact that the plaintiff’s status as a wholly owned subsidiary made the transfer of the ownership of property essentially a matter of form; and on the fact that the evidence demonstrated that the transfer was made for the sole purpose of obtaining jurisdiction.
