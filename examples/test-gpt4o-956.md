**Generation:**

Salsbury’s allegations fail to recognize the established principles surrounding the termination for convenience clause. As elucidated in John Reiner & Co. v. United States, 163 Ct. Cl. 381, 325 F.2d 438 (1963), convenience terminations are legally permissible when deemed in the government’s best interest, barring bad faith or clear abuse of discretion (390 F.2d 702). Here, the contracting officer terminated Salsbury’s contract following a court order — a decision marked by judicial authority rather than arbitrariness or capriciousness. Moreover, as seen in 390 F.2d 702, a valid default, if influenced by factors beyond the contractor’s control, should be treated as a convenience termination. 

Salsbury’s contention, drawing on Torncello v. United States, 231 Ct. Cl. 20, 681 F.2d 756 (1982), misinterprets its applicability. Unlike Torncello, where premeditated non-fulfillment was at issue, the Postal Service here intended genuine completion of the contract until judicial intervention necessitated otherwise. Importantly, precedent affirms that deviations from procedural norms without substantive prejudice to the contractor do not translate to common-law breaches (325 F.2d 438).

Therefore, Salsbury’s arguments are untenable under the precedents provided by 390 F.2d 702 and 325 F.2d 438, as the termination was within the lawful realm of the convenience clause.

gold_text: The Doninger injunction was a proper and sufficient basis for the termination of Salsbury’s contract. This principle is well-recognized. Convenience terminations have been sustained when they were invoked to avoid conflict with other governmental entities. Schlesinger v. United States, 182 Ct.Cl. 571, 390 F.2d 702 (1968) (the Navy deferred to the views of a Senate subcommittee); John Reiner & Co., 325 F.2d 438 (compliance with a General Accounting Office ruling). If deference to the nonbinding views of those political bodies supports a convenience termination, it could hardly be otherwise when the contract is terminated because of an order of a United States district court.
