Reviewing the evidence and arguments presented, it is clear that Plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated that the debt in question qualifies as a domestic support obligation under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5). The Debtor's obligation to pay $200,000 as stipulated in the Divorce Decree appears to be in the nature of a property settlement rather than alimony, maintenance, or support. In reference case 146 B.R. 862, similar debt was deemed dischargeable because it was characterized as part of a property division rather than support obligations. Additionally, in reference case 156 B.R. 338, obligations related to the division of marital assets were determined to be dischargeable since they were not alimony or support. The characterization of the $200,000 payment aligns more closely with these precedents.

Furthermore, comparing with reference case 56 B.R. 460, where obligations providing continued support for housing the ex-spouse and children were deemed nondischargeable, no such context of direct ongoing support is present here. The Maine Property's retention by Debtor, unaccompanied by an express provision for the support of Plaintiff, further supports this conclusion.

In conclusion, the debt in question does not satisfy the criteria for nondischargeability under § 523(a)(5) as a domestic support obligation. Consequently, on this issue, summary judgment is not in favor of the Plaintiff.

ORDERED that Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on the claim that the debt is nondischargeable under § 523(a)(5) is DENIED.

gold_text: Plaintiff contends that the debt owed to her is a domestic support obligation because the Massachusetts family court ordered the monies paid to her to enable her to pay off credit card debt that Debtor incurred in her name. Plaintiff established that the debt is one owed to a former spouse and owed pursuant to a divorce decree. See 11 U.S.C. § 101(14A). Plaintiff does not, however, establish that the debt is “in the nature of support” rather than a property settlement. Most relevant is intent of the family court as reflected in the Divorce Decree. Cummings, 244 F.3d at 1266. The Divorce Decree states that the money is “to be applied to the debt he incurred during the course of the marriage, for which Wife is now being held responsible.” An allocation of pre-existing debts usually suggests that an order reflects a property settlement. Baker v. Baker, 146 B.R. 862, 866 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1992); but see e.g. In re Delaine, 56 B.R. 460, 467-68 (Bankr.N.D.Ala.1985); Johnson v. Johnson, 156 B.R. 338, 341-42 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1993).
