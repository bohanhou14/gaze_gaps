In the context of the reference cases, we find that the district court's dismissal of the § 1983 claim is consistent with the doctrine of supplemental jurisdiction. In 57 F.3d 1168, the court held that where the federal claims are dismissed before trial, even though not unsubstantial in a jurisdictional sense, the state claims should be dismissed without prejudice. Similarly, in 137 F.3d 666, the court noted that when the federal claims are dismissed before trial, the state claims should be dismissed as well.

Here, the district court correctly dismissed the § 1983 claim for failure to state a claim, and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. The claim was based on alleged violations of the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, but the record does not support these claims. The municipality's actions were taken in its proprietary capacity, and not in a sovereign capacity, rendering the claims unripe for constitutional review.

Furthermore, the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction is not applicable in this case, as the state law claims are not so related to the federal claims that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. The district court did not err in declining to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims.

In conclusion, the district court's dismissal of the § 1983 claim and decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims is consistent with the doctrine of supplemental jurisdiction and the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction. The claims were properly dismissed for failure to state a claim, and the district court did not err in declining to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims.

gold_text: Because there is no substantial constitutional claim, we also conclude that there is no federal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ state law claims, as the remaining state law claims were only argued to “be allowed to proceed ... [under] supplemental jurisdiction.” Appellant Br. 33. “As a general matter, a court will decline supplemental jurisdiction if the underlying [federal] claims are dismissed before trial.” 13D Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3567.3, at 429 (3d ed. 2007). Case law from this circuit supports this “general principle [that] the unfavorable disposition of a plaintiffs federal claims at the early stages of a suit ... will trigger the dismissal ... of any supplemental state-law claims.” González-De-Blasini, 377 F.3d at 89 (quoting Rodríguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir. 1995)). Specifically, in Camelio v. American Fed., 137 F.3d 666 (1st Cir. 1998), this court held that after the district court had dismissed a suit’s federal claims for failure to state a claim, it also “should have refrained from exercising supplemental jurisdiction over [the] state law claims and remanded them to state court.” Id. at 673.
