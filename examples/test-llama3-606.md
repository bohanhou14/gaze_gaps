In order to determine whether the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is adequate or ineffective to test the legality of Petitioner Elijah White’s detention, we must consider the requirements set forth in Jones v. United States, 226 F.3d 328 (4th Cir. 2000). Specifically, the court must determine whether the three prongs of the Jones test are met: (1) at the time of conviction, settled law of this circuit or the Supreme Court established the legality of the conviction; (2) subsequent to the prisoner’s direct appeal and first § 2255 motion, the substantive law changed such that the conduct of which the prisoner was convicted is deemed not to be criminal; and (3) the prisoner cannot satisfy the gatekeeping provisions of § 2255 because the new rule is not one of constitutional law.

In this case, Petitioner White fails to meet the Jones test. He has not shown that the substantive law changed subsequent to his direct appeal and first § 2255 motion, rendering his conviction no longer criminal. Furthermore, he has not demonstrated that the gatekeeping provisions of § 2255 are inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.

In United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 220 (1952), the Supreme Court held that a substitution of a collateral remedy that is both adequate and effective does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. Similarly, in Parker v. North Carolina, 373 U.S. 349 (1963), the Court held that a state prisoner may seek habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, even if he has already exhausted his state remedies, if he can demonstrate that the remedy available under state law is inadequate or ineffective.

In conclusion, the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is adequate and effective to test the legality of Petitioner White’s detention, and his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 is therefore denied. The court finds that Petitioner White has failed to demonstrate that his detention is illegal, and therefore, his petition for habeas corpus relief is dismissed.

gold_text: A petition under § 2241 is available for a federal prisoner to collaterally attack his sentence, however, when a motion under § 2255 is “inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.” § 2255; see also Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372, 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977). Petitioner has previously filed a § 2255 petition which was denied. C/A 2:03-379- PMD. The Fourth Circuit has unequivocally held that “ § 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because an individual is unable to obtain relief under that provision. A contrary rule would effectively nullify the gatekeeping provisions.” In re Jones, 226 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2000) (citations omitted). It is likely that this Petition is filed outside of the one-year statute of limitations on § 2255 petitions. However, “[sjection 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because the sentencing court does not grant relief, the one-year statute of limitations has expired, or the petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of the amended § 2255.” Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, 290 F.3d 536, 539 (3rd Cir.2002). Rather, “[a] § 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective only where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a § 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim. It is the inefficacy of the remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative.” Id. at 538.
