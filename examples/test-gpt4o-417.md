3. Upon examining further, similar cases underscore the principle that municipalities lack the inherent power to grant exclusive franchises without explicit legislative authorization. In *Vicksburg v. Vicksburg Waterworks Company*, 202 U.S. 453, 50 L. Ed. 1102, it was decided that a contract giving exclusive water supply rights to a company holds, provided it does not create ruinous competition with a city-initiated system, thereby demonstrating the inviolability of such exclusive contracts within their terms. This principle was similarly echoed in *Vicksburg Waterworks Co. v. Vicksburg*, 185 U. S. 65, 51 L. Ed. 1155, affirming that municipalities excluding themselves from direct competition via contracts can be sanctioned federally even if such ordinances are passed in proprietary capacity. 

It is crucial to delineate that the core argument revolves around whether the city overstepped its authorized power by extending exclusivity beyond street lighting to cover private utilities supply. By upholding precedents like *Vicksburg* cases, the decision projects a focus on strict legislative mandates governing municipal contracts and precluding unauthorized concessions beyond legislative grants.
