The Brecht decision highlights critical nuances in applying harmless-error standards in habeas corpus contexts. Barber contends the district court improperly employed the less rigorous Brecht standard instead of Chapman. Nevertheless, the precedent set in Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, confirms that the Kotteakos standard, 328 U.S. 750, should be used in federal habeas reviews, focusing on whether an error had a "substantial and injurious effect or influence" on the jury's verdict. This approach acknowledges the principles of federalism, comity, and the finality of state convictions as underscored in Brecht. Our court in 75 F.3d 1017 reaffirmed that Brecht's less onerous standard applies even if the constitutional error was not reviewed under Chapman on direct appeal. We adhere to this principle despite Barber's argument for the broader Chapman standard, resulting in a denial of his CPC application.
