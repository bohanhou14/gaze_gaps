The issue at hand is whether the federal court has the authority to issue an injunction to stay state court proceedings under 28 U.S.C. § 2283. The Supreme Court has held in Toucey v. New York Life Insurance Co., 314 U.S. 118, that a federal court cannot grant an injunction to stay state court proceedings except as authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.

However, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, specifically Title II, provides that no person shall be punished or attempt to punish any person for exercising or attempting to exercise any right or privilege secured by the Act. 42 U.S.C. § 203(c). This provision has been held constitutional in Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, and Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294.

In this case, the appellants were attempting to exercise their right to equal public accommodations under the Act and were subsequently arrested and charged with breach of the peace. The district court denied their request for a temporary restraining order to stay the state court proceedings. However, the court of appeals held that the Civil Rights Act did constitute express authorization for the federal court to enjoin the state court proceedings.

The court of appeals also held that the policy against interference with state criminal proceedings was not a rule of statutory derivation, but rather a rule of comity, and that it could be abrogated by Congress. The court further held that the Civil Rights Act had abrogated the comity rule with respect to injunctions against state proceedings brought to punish those who peaceably assert their rights under Title II.

In conclusion, the federal court has the authority to issue an injunction to stay state court proceedings under 28 U.S.C. § 2283, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 constitutes express authorization for the federal court to enjoin the state court proceedings. The policy against interference with state criminal proceedings is a rule of comity that can be abrogated by Congress, and the Civil Rights Act has abrogated this rule with respect to injunctions against state proceedings brought to punish those who peaceably assert their rights under Title II.

gold_text: . Section 2283 is the successor to § 5 of the Act of March 2, 1793, 1 Stat. at L. 335, Chap. 22, which provided that no writ of injunction might be granted on the part of Federal courts to stay proceedings in any state court. This section was later amended to make an exception for proceedings in bankruptcy. 36 Stat. at L. 1162, Chap. 231. The provision, as amended, was carried forward as § 720 of the Revised Statutes (1874), § 265 of the Judicial Code (1911), and as 28 U.S.C.A. § 379 (1940). Section 2283 resulted from the revision of the Judicial Code in 1948. 62 Stat. 968. The history of the section together with the exceptions which had been statutorily or judicially created to it are fully discussed by the Supreme Court in Toucey v.
