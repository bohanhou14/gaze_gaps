In determining whether a compulsory counterclaim should bar the plaintiffs' action for reformation, we look closely at the logical relationship test. As referenced in Republic Health v. Lifemark Hospitals of Florida, 755 F.2d 1453, the logical relationship test assesses if the counterclaim arises from the same aggregate of operative facts as the original claim. This was further underscored in United States v. Aronson, 617 F.2d 119, which established that if the same operative facts form the basis of both claims, then the counterclaim is indeed compulsory.

Applying this test to our case, the reformation of the contract is directly related to the initial claim regarding underpayment. As such, failing to assert this as a counterclaim in the original state court suit against Juster does indeed bar subsequent litigation on these grounds (834 F.2d 970). 

However, the case of appellant Weigel requires a separate analysis. Given that Weigel was not a party to the initial litigation, the compulsory counterclaim rule might not apply to him unless he can be placed within the bounds of lis pendens, which requires further factual determination (755 F.2d 1453). Thus, we remand for such determinations regarding Weigel’s notice of the original suit and whether lis pendens applies.

Conclusively, the district court’s ruling is affirmed in part and remanded in part for further proceedings concerning appellant Weigel.

For example, where plaintiff bought a tractor and sued for unsatisfactory performance, a claim by the manufacturer-defendant for nonpayment of notes on other purchased equipment is not a compulsory counterclaim.

Lifemark Hospitals, 755 F.2d 1453 (11th Cir.1985) (in suit focused on the narrow issue of the legal right to purchase, a new complaint that is wide-ranging, alleging antitrust violations, is not a compulsory counterclaim).
