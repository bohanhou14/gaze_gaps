In determining the appropriate interest rate for the Bank's secured claim under the proposed plan, we must consider the calculation of market rate interest as established in precedent. The case of Koopmans v. Farm Credit Servs., 102 F.3d 874 (7th Cir.1996) and the principles outlined in 105 F.3d 55 emphasize that the market rate of interest under ยง 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) should be fixed at the rate on a United States Treasury instrument with a maturity equivalent to the repayment schedule under the debtor's reorganization plan. 

This approach was corroborated by several other jurisdictions, ensuring objectivity and uniform results. Additionally, a risk premium is required to reflect the creditor's risk from deferred payments (105 F.3d 55; In re Fowler, 903 F.2d 694, 698 (9th Cir. 1990)). As such, the interest rate must not only be equivalent to the treasury bond rate but also include a risk premium.

Furthermore, the provision regarding the right to modify the creditor's claim under 11 U.S.C. ยง 1322(b)(2) was contested. However, as stated in 962 F.2d 176, full payment includes present value interest, compensating the creditor for the time value until full repayment, thus acceptable under the bankruptcy code.

Therefore, while the Debtors' proposed plan indicates partial payment incongruent with their schedules, the Court must ensure the correct application of the acceptable interest rate and confirm that the plan meets the requirements of ยง 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii). This approach safeguards the Bank's claim while aligning with judicial precedents.
