Defendant contends the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of prior accusations of theft against another employee to show Dr. Habib's intent under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). In United States v. Nolan, it was established that a trial court has broad discretion in balancing the probative value and unfair prejudice of evidence (551 F.2d 266, 271 (10th Cir. 1977)). Here, the trial court determined the testimony was collateral and inadmissible. In United States v. McKinnell, an appellate court should only reverse such decisions for an abuse of discretion (888 F.2d 669, 676 (10th Cir. 1989)).

Additionally, Ms. Young claimed that the prior accusations were relevant to show Dr. Habib's plan and intent. The court, however, must balance the probative value against potential prejudice as dictated in United States v. Record (873 F.2d 1363, 1375 (10th Cir. 1989)), and found any probative value was outweighed by its potential prejudice, a discretion supported by United States v. Shepherd (739 F.2d 510 (10th Cir. 1984)). The court did not find the need to review the sufficiency of this evidence under the "abuse of discretion" standard as the evidence was weighed properly, aligning with the rationale in United States v. Recalde (761 F.2d 1448, 1457 (10th Cir. 1985)).

Thus, in alignment with precedents such as 918 F.2d 115 and 804 F.2d 1161, the trial court's discretion in excluding this testimony was properly exercised and does not constitute reversible error.
