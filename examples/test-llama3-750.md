In the case of Rome v. Braunstein, the appellant, Rome, appeals the decision of the bankruptcy court disallowing his fees as counsel to the chapter 11 debtor, Chestnut Hill Mortgage Corporation (CHM). The bankruptcy court disallowed Rome's fees based on his failure to disclose conflicting interests, including his representation of Arnold Leavitt, the sole shareholder of CHM, and Sandra Dickerman, a secretary at CHM.

The court held that Rome's failure to disclose these conflicting interests constituted a disqualifying conflict of interest under Bankruptcy Code § 328(c). The court also found that Rome's representation of Leavitt and Dickerman created a risk of divided loyalties and undermined confidence in his ability to provide impartial advice to the CHM estate.

In reaching this decision, the court relied on several factors, including the fact that Rome had a long history of representing CHM and its officers, and that he had a significant amount of knowledge about the company's finances and operations. The court also noted that Rome's failure to disclose his conflicting interests created an appearance of impropriety and undermined the integrity of the bankruptcy process.

In support of its decision, the court cited several reference cases, including 372 U.S. 633 and 312 U.S. 262, which demonstrate the importance of full and timely disclosure in bankruptcy proceedings. The court also noted that the Bankruptcy Code requires court-appointed counsel to be disinterested and to represent the interests of the estate, and that Rome's failure to meet these requirements constituted a breach of his fiduciary duty.

In conclusion, the bankruptcy court's decision to disallow Rome's fees was well-reasoned and supported by the facts of the case. The court's reliance on reference cases and its application of the Bankruptcy Code demonstrate a commitment to upholding the integrity of the bankruptcy process and ensuring that court-appointed counsel provide impartial and effective representation to debtors and creditors.

See In re Kendavis, 91 B.R. at 753 (citing Wolf v. Weinstein, 372 U.S. 633, 641, 83 S.Ct. 969, 975, 10 L.Ed.2d 33 (1963)). “A fiduciary ... may not perfect his claim to compensation by insisting that, although he had conflicting interests, he served his several masters equally well or that his primary loyalty was not weakened by the pull of his secondary one.” Woods v. City Nat’l Bank & Trust Co., 312 U.S. 262, 269, 61 S.Ct. 493, 497, 85 L.Ed. 820 (1941); In re Roger J. An, 71 B.R. at 241. Especially where there has been a clear failure to make timely and spontaneous disclosure of all facts material to a disqualifying conflict of interest, counsel appointed pursuant to section 327(a) can lay no claim of right to a lesser sanction than the bankruptcy court is authorized to impose pursuant to section 328(c).
