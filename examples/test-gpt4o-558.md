The plaintiff's argument largely hinges on the weight of Dr. Davies’ opinion concerning her mental condition. Nevertheless, the lack of contemporaneous treatment notes reduces the probative value of Dr. Davies’ assertions, aligning with precedents where conclusory statements were deemed insufficient, as illustrated in Griggs v. Schweiker, 545 F.Supp. 475 (S.D.W.Va.1982). The Secretary's decision also finds strong support in the substantial evidence requirement reaffirmed in Shively v. Heckler, 739 F.2d 987, 989 (4th Cir.1984).

Moreover, as in 552 F.2d 202, where the trier of fact’s scope is emphasized, here the Secretary acted within this scope by disregarding unsupported medical opinions. This is further buttressed by the testimony of the psychiatric specialist, Dr. Adamo, who, despite not personally examining the plaintiff, based his consistent findings on a comprehensive review of the records—a practice upheld as valid in Smith v. Schweiker, 795 F.2d 343, 346 (4th Cir.1986) and Kyle v. Cohen, 449 F.2d 489, 492 (4th Cir.1971).

Examining the evidence through the lens of these standards undeniably reveals that the Secretary's finding against disability is well-supported. Consistent with the decision in 524 F.2d 1076, where the jury could infer key conclusions from the evidence presented, the administrative findings here permit a similar inference. Consequently, the Secretary's determination must stand.

Respondent argues that given the opportunities plaintiff had to submit the treatment notes, it is not unfair to infer that if such notes existed, they would not have advanced plaintiffs cause. Cf.
