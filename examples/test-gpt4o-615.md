Under the statutory framework and judicial precedents from other jurisdictions, it becomes evident that Cananwill's security interest in the unearned premiums is akin to a valid and perfected transaction circumventing the need for notice filings ordinarily mandated under Article 9. Specifically, reference case 72 B.R. 208 examines the broad exclusionary language of section 25-9-104 of North Carolina and affirms that Article 9 does not apply to transactions where the collateral is unearned insurance premiums. The court in Premium Financing Specialists, Inc. v. Lindsey, 11 B.R. 135 (Ark.1981) echoed these sentiments by holding that premiums act outside the customary lien structures provided by Article 9.

Moreover, reference case 2 B.R. 550 elucidates the New Jersey framework where the state law obviates the necessity for filing a financing statement for premium finance agreements. It points out that such a perfected security interest is enforceable against a debtor in possession without additional notice requirements, aligning with the intent of public policy not to encourage secret liens as emphasized in In re Cushman Baking, 526 F.2d 23 (1st Cir. 1975).

Finally, in reference case 3 B.R. 4’s application of Washington state law, it is discussed how specific statutes governing premium finance agreements supersede the general provisions of Article 9, with the court highlighting the non-applicability of UCC provisions to these specialized financial instruments.

These cases collectively affirm that under both statutory and case law, including analogous statutes and judicial interpretation from various jurisdictions, Cananwill's security interest in the unearned premiums was indeed valid and perfected prior to the Debtor’s bankruptcy filing.

Those cases have held that a security interest in unearned premiums attaches and is perfected upon the funding of the policy, not upon a later cancellation of the policy.
