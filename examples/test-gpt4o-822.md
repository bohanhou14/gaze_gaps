To determine the reasonableness of Mack's sentence, we first review for significant procedural errors. As stated in reference case 511 F.3d 468 and reiterated in 526 F.3d 155, significant errors may include improperly calculating the Guidelines range or failing to consider the § 3553(a) factors. The district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range and adequately considered the § 3553(a) factors, providing a detailed explanation for the sentence.

Regarding substantive reasonableness, we assess the totality of the circumstances, per 526 F.3d 155. The sentence of 300 months, although substantial, falls within permissible boundaries given Mack's criminal history and the nature of his offenses. The court provided a reasoned judgment that justifies the variance under § 3553(a).

As the district court's decision meets the criteria outlined in Gall and confirmed under 511 F.3d 468, we find no basis for concluding that the sentence was substantively unreasonable. Thus, Mack's sentence is affirmed as reasonable under the comprehensive and deferential standards set forth in the referenced cases.

Pauley, 511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). “If the district court decides to impose a sentence outside the Guidelines range, it must ensure that its justification supports the degree of the variance.” United States v. Evans, 526 F.3d 155, 161 (4th Cir.2008). While we may presume that a sentence within the Guidelines range is reasonable, we may not presume that a sentence outside the Guidelines range is unreasonable. Gall, 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.
