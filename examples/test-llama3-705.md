This case is a bench trial, where the court is considering the evidence against the defendant, Alan Kaye, for federal criminal offenses. The court is tasked with determining whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court first considers the mail fraud charge, Count One, which alleges that Kaye and his co-schemers devised a scheme to defraud Cook County and its citizens of their right to have the business of the Cook County Circuit Court conducted honestly and fairly. The court finds that the government has not proved this charge beyond a reasonable doubt, as there is no evidence that Kaye was engaged in a scheme to corrupt the court system, and the court finds that the government's proof is based on a "manufactured jurisdiction" theory, which is not supported by the evidence.

The court also considers the Hobbs Act charges, Counts Two through Eight, which allege that Kaye extorted money from individuals under color of official right. The court finds that the government has not proved these charges beyond a reasonable doubt, as there is no evidence that Kaye's actions affected interstate commerce. The court notes that the victims were individuals, not businesses, and that the payments were made with personal funds, not business assets.

The court cites several reference cases, including 742 F.2d 340 and 493 F.2d 1124, to support its findings. The court concludes that the government has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and acquits Kaye on all charges.

gold_text: Once again our Court of Appeals has addressed a closely-related concept only last week in United States v. Vanichromanee, 742 F.2d 340 (7th Cir.1984). In the course of upholding a conviction on charges of interstate racketeering, the Court found interstate travel — a necessary ingredient of that offense, like interstate commerce in a Hobbs Act case — had been “designed to promote, carry on, or further that illegal purpose” (id. at 349). It distinguished other cases where convictions had been reversed because the travel or other necessary federal elements of the crimes charged had been merely “fortuitous or isolated and incidental” (id.). By coincidence one of those cases had also involved one of the early “intangible rights” convictions, that of former Governor and Judge Otto Kerner and former Illinois Director of Revenue Theodore Isaacs, United States v. Isaacs, 493 F.2d 1124, 1146-49 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 976, 94 S.Ct. 3184, 41 L.Ed.2d 1146 (1974). In exactly the sense used by Isaacs and by the other cases cited in Vanichromanee, the government’s invocation of claimed interstate commerce effects here refers to items wholly “fortuitous or isolated and incidental,” and thus insufficient to sustain a conviction.
