**Generation:**

Keen’s third argument posits that the report of her human resources expert and the testimony of Miller’s corporate representative created a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Miller and Aerotek should have known of Robertson’s violent propensity.

Rule 56 does not compel the district court to sift through the record in search of evidence to support a party's opposition to summary judgment (953 F.2d 909). Keen failed to direct the district court’s attention to the specific portions of the expert report and testimony that allegedly support her claim. As established in 19 F.3d 1527, evidence must be designated timely in the district court proceedings, not later on appeal.

Even taking the designated evidentiary materials into account, the case law emphasizes that extraordinary diligence is required from employers only when the work inherently presents a serious risk of harm, which is not applicable here (953 F.2d 909). Therefore, Keen’s belated attempt to introduce specifics from the record is insufficient.

In conclusion, the lack of a genuine issue of material fact, coupled with Keen's failure to demonstrate that Miller and Aerotek had a duty to conduct background checks, compels us to AFFIRM the district court's grant of summary judgment.
