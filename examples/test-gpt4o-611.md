**Generation:**

Bonner alleges that the failure to provide a qualified interpreter constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. In evaluating similar claims under the totality of conditions, the Fifth Circuit found in **679 F.2d 1115** that poor prison conditions collectively can result in cruel and unusual punishment. Here, Bonner's lack of communication aids significantly affects his daily prison life and poses risks to his safety, potentially rising to a level of cruel and unusual punishment.

Moreover, referencing **688 F.2d 266**, the appellate court addressed double-celling and the intrusiveness of imposed remedial measures. It emphasized the necessity to balance constitutional requirements against undue interference in prison management. In Bonner's case, the provision of a qualified interpreter might be seen as a minimally intrusive remedy essential for safeguarding his constitutional rights without excessively interfering with prison operations.

Therefore, genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the absence of a qualified interpreter for Bonner constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Hence, summary judgment on this claim should not have been granted.
