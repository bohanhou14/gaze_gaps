The cases of 152 F.2d 239 and 19 F.2d 110 are relevant to the issue of waiver and estoppel in the context of insurance policies. In both cases, the courts held that a waiver or suspension of the policy's provision limiting the time for suit must be supported by an agreement founded upon a valuable consideration.

In the case of Forman v. Westchester Fire Insurance Company, the court is faced with a similar issue. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant waived the requirement of the policy concerning seasonability of claims through negotiations and correspondence. However, the court found that the negotiations ended with the letter of December 2, 1942, and that there was no agreement or consideration that would support a waiver or estoppel.

The court distinguished the case from Martin v. State Ins. Co., 44 N.J.L. 485, 43 Am.Rep. 397, where the court held that negotiations continued past the expiration of the limitation period, which was not the case here. The court also noted that the correspondence between the parties did not contain any evidence of an offer to negotiate a settlement or to arbitrate, or to pay the claims against the Westchester Group in the event the plaintiff recovered against the Rhode Island Group.

In conclusion, the court held that there was no waiver or estoppel in this case, and that the plaintiff's claim was barred by the policy's limitation period. The case serves as a reminder that in order to establish a waiver or estoppel, there must be an agreement or consideration that supports the claim, and that negotiations alone are not sufficient to establish a waiver or estoppel.

gold_text: The rule regarding waiver is aptly expressed in the cases of Continental Ins. Co. v. Fire Ass’n, 6 Cir., 1945, 152 F.2d 239; and Reynolds v. Detroit Fidelity & Surety Co., 6 Cir., 1927, 19 F.2d 110, wherein waivers of the time for bringing suit wat claimed. In the former case the complaint alleged negotiations in an endeavor to arrive at an amicable disposition, and the court stated: “We think the District Judge was right in holding that mere negotiations in an endeavor to arrive at an amicable disposition of a controversy are insufficient basis for the application of the doctrine of waiver or estoppel. It is noteworthy that there are in the complaint no allegations of promises to pay, concealment, bad faith, fraud, misrepresentation or other facts which might be construed as an attempt to mislead plaintiff’s assignor or to lull it into a sense of security, or into the belief that payment of any amount would be made by defendant. There is no allegation, direct or inferential, of intention by plaintiff’s assignor to commence suit within the period limited by the policy and of its being turned from that course of action by misleading acts or promises by the defendant. No facts are alleged from which an inference might be drawn that the postponement of the suit was at the express or implied request of the defendant, or that there was an intentional delay in adjustment until after the limitation period provided in the policy had passed.” 152 F.2d 239, 240.
