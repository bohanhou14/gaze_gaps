The government appeals the district court's application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the defendants in this case. The court sentenced Vaughan and Bigelow under Guideline § 2B3.2, "Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage," and Lima under Guideline § 2A6.1, "Threatening Communications." The government argues that the court erred in applying these guidelines and that Lima's sentence should have been determined under Guideline § 2E2.1, "Making, Financing, or Collecting an Extortionate Extension of Credit."

In United States v. Struder, 891 F.2d 650, the court held that the "ostrich instruction" was appropriate where there was evidence that the defendant was associated with a group but had consciously avoided knowledge of the group's illegal activities. Here, there was evidence that Lima knew of the threats and violence used by Vaughan and Bigelow against the victims, and he benefited from the scheme. Therefore, the court's application of the "ostrich instruction" was proper.

The court also departed downward two points from the offense level for each defendant pursuant to Guideline § 5K2.10, based on the contributory conduct of one of the victims, William Burks. The government argues that this departure was improper. However, in United States v. Left Hand Bull, 901 F.2d 647, the court held that a district court has discretion to depart from the guidelines when a victim's wrongful conduct contributed significantly to provoking the offense behavior.

In conclusion, the government's challenges to the sentencing guidelines in this case are without merit. The court's application of the guidelines was proper, and its departure downward was reasonable. The defendants' sentences were appropriate given the circumstances of the case. Therefore, the government's appeal is denied. <answer>  Answer  [Assistant](/assistant)<br><br><br> === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === ===

gold_text: Invoking this section, the district court departed downward two points on each defendant’s sentence due to the conduct of William Burks. Based on our review of the record, however, we do not believe that Mr. Burks conduct in this offense is the type that warrants departure under § 5K2.10. We accept as given that Burks refused to repay his debts to Lima and M & V, and we do not dispute the district court’s recognition that Burks has an unpleasant voice and demeanor. This does not, however, excuse the defendants’ actions; nor does it warrant departure from the Guidelines. Section 5K2.10 contemplates situations where the actions of the victim provoke the conduct of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Yellow Earrings, 891 F.2d 650 (8th Cir.1989) (downward departure warranted where victim pushed defendant, verbally abused her, and attempted to publicly humiliate her when she refused his request for sexual intercourse). See also United States v. Left Hand Bull, 901 F.2d 647 (8th Cir.1990) (departure based on victim conduct approved in sentence for threatening letter to ex-wife where husband frustrated by reports of wife’s abandonment of child). Here, the victim, Burks, did not engage in the behavior contemplated by § 5K2.10. Burks’ physical blocking of the doorway of his home could not be considered sufficient physical contact to provoke the attack by Bigelow and Vaughan. Burks was at worst an unpleasant and untrustworthy person. This does not excuse beating him, nor the extortion of his funds. The court erred in departing downward based on these facts.
