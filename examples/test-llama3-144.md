The case at hand involves a sexual harassment claim brought by plaintiff Suzanne Lindblom against her former employer, The Challenger Day Program, Ltd., and Eleanor Flynn, the executive director. The plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to a hostile work environment by her coworker, Robert Salmons, and that her employer failed to take adequate measures to address the situation.

To determine whether the plaintiff's claim is actionable, the court must evaluate the totality of the circumstances. In Harris v. Forklift, the Supreme Court held that workplace harassment is actionable only if it is "sufficiently severe or pervasive 'to alter the conditions of [the victim's] employment and create an abusive working environment.'" 510 U.S. at 67, 106 S.Ct. 2399.

In this case, the plaintiff alleges that Salmons engaged in a range of inappropriate behaviors, including staring at her, touching her knee and shoulder, and asking her about her weekend. While these incidents may be considered inappropriate or unprofessional, they do not necessarily rise to the level of a hostile work environment. As the Seventh Circuit noted in Adusumilli v. City of Chicago, "too tepid or intermittent or equivocal to make a reasonable person believe that [the plaintiff had] been discriminated against on the basis of her sex." 164 F.3d at 362.

Furthermore, the plaintiff's allegations are somewhat limited in scope, focusing primarily on a single incident at a party and a series of isolated incidents in the classroom. While these incidents may be considered harassing, they do not necessarily create a hostile work environment. As the court noted in Scott v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., "relatively isolated and innocuous incidents will not support a hostile environment claim." 798 F.2d at 211.

In conclusion, the plaintiff's claim of sexual harassment is not actionable under Title VII. The incidents alleged by the plaintiff are not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment, and the plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.

gold_text: Similarly, in Weiss v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 990 F.2d 333, 337 (7th Cir.1993), the plaintiff complained of a hostile work environment caused by an overly amorous supervisor. On numerous occasions, the supervisor asked her for dates, called her a dumb blond, and put his hand on her shoulder. He attempted to kiss the plaintiff at a bar, and, on two occasions, he tried to kiss her in her office. The supervisor even placed an “I love you” sign in her work area. The Seventh Circuit held that these incidents did not amount to actionable sexual harassment because they were not sufficiently pervasive and severe from an objective perspective. Id. at 337. See also McKenzie v. Illinois Dept. of Transportation, 92 F.3d 473, 479-80 (7th Cir.1996) (holding that three sexually suggestive and offensive comments over a three-month period did not unreasonably interfere with the work environment from an objective perspective).
