The cases presented in the references highlight the complexities of modifying a consent decree. In United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U.S. 244 (1968), the Court imposed a variety of restrictions and conditions designed to recreate a competitive market. Similarly, in United States v. City of Chicago and Fraternal Order of Police, 663 F.2d 1354 (1981), the Court considered modifying a consent decree to address changing circumstances. However, in both cases, the Court emphasized the importance of exceptional circumstances and the need to weigh the equities.

In the instant case, plaintiffs seek to modify the consent decree to provide a Gautreaux set-aside out of the fiscal 1982 GNMA Tandem program. However, the Court finds that the circumstances are not exceptional and that the decree should not be modified. The Court notes that the future of the GNMA Tandem program is uncertain, and that plaintiffs' attempts to negotiate a set-aside into the decree in August 1980 were unsuccessful.

The Court also references Mayberry v. Maroney, 558 F.2d 1159 (1977), which highlights the importance of considering the interests of the class in determining whether a case or controversy exists. In this case, the Court finds that the interests of the class are not sufficient to justify modification of the decree.

Finally, the Court references United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106 (1932), and United States v. ITT Continental Baking Company, 420 U.S. 223 (1975), which emphasize the importance of considering the principles of contract and contract modification. In this case, the Court finds that the decree should not be modified because the parties did not negotiate the set-aside into the decree at the time of settlement.

In conclusion, the Court denies the plaintiffs' motion to modify the consent decree, finding that the circumstances are not exceptional and that the decree should not be modified. The Court's decision is guided by the principles of contract modification and the importance of considering the interests of the class.
