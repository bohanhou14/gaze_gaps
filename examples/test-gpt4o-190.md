Our assessment aligns with the precedent set forth in Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, establishing that ordinances impacting free expression must balance regulatory needs with constitutional protections. In the instant case, New Albany’s ordinance must be scrutinized to ensure it avoids infringing on First Amendment rights. The court's reliance on inadequate anecdotal evidence, such as assumptions about pornographic litter and theft risks, does not meet the threshold of empirical justification highlighted in 368 F.3d 1186, which requires substantive legislative evidence demonstrating adverse secondary effects specific to the regulated activity.

Moreover, as discussed in 466 U.S. 789, the mere potential for litter or minor visual clutter does not justify broad regulatory measures that intrude on protected speech. New Albany’s ordinance, by imposing a 1,000-feet restriction based on speculative harms, does not adequately demonstrate the adverse effects required under Alameda Books and therefore, fails to be constitutionally sustainable without substantial empirical evidence directly correlating these bookstores to the cited harms.

Thus, a remand for further evidentiary proceedings is warranted given the current lack of substantiating evidence, echoing the standards set in precedent cases.

gold_text: Pornographic litter is the City’s other principal basis. The printed word often is tossed away, but litter-control justifications have fared poorly as reasons to regulate pamphlets and other written materials. Compare Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 60 S.Ct. 146, 84 L.Ed. 155 (1939), with Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 808-10, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984). Perhaps smutty litter should be judged by different standards, but first it is necessary to know how serious the problem is. That one pedodontist in Spokane complained about litter from one bookstore, see World Wide Video of Washington, Inc. v. Spokane, 368 F.3d 1186, 1197 (9th Cir.2004), does not do much to establish that this is a serious problem in New Albany (or even in Spokane). The volume of complaints exceeds the number of genuine problems. There are thousands of adult bookstores; it should be easy to find out how much litter they generate, how much of this litter falls into the hands of minors, and whether this is a materially greater problem when one store carries 40% adult books than when lots of stores carry 10% apiece. (Many a convenience store, newsstand, or video rental outlet has an adult nook, which escapes regulation under New Albany’s statute.) Plaintiff has been in operation for a while now; is sexually themed litter a problem near its store?
