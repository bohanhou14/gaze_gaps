In evaluating Ivanov's claims of past persecution, it is essential to distinguish between mere harassment and actions that rise to the level of persecution. According to 154 F.3d 719, persecution involves "punishment" or "the infliction of harm" based on race, religion, nationality, group membership, or political opinion, which must surpass the threshold of mere harassment. Similarly, 105 F.3d 374 emphasizes that past persecution can create a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution unless evidence shows conditions in the home country have changed significantly. Here, substantial changes in Bulgaria's political landscape, as noted in the State Department’s advisory opinion, weaken Ivanov's claims of future persecution.

Furthermore, the evaluation of past persecution should be grounded on concrete and credible evidence, not generalized conditions of strife (222 F.3d 417). The lack of specific, corroborated incidents of mistreatment undermines the claim. Hence, based on precedents in 154 F.3d 719, 105 F.3d 374, and 222 F.3d 417, the BIA's decision to deny asylum and withholding of deportation is supported by substantial evidence and Ivanov’s failure to provide consistent and credible testimony about his past alleged persecution.

gold_text: Ivanov’s failure to credibly establish past persecution also undermines his argument of a well-founded fear of future persecution. If an alien establishes past persecution, there is a rebuttable presumption that he also has a well-founded fear of future persecution and therefore should be granted asylum. See 8 C.F.R. § 208(b); see also Asani v. INS, 154 F.3d 719, 722 (7th Cir.1998). But the reverse also often holds true: “Because the asylum laws assume that the past is often prologue to the future, petitioners’ failure to show past persecution, without more, bodes poorly for their attempt to show a well-founded fear of persecution.” Marquez v. INS, 105 F.3d 374, 380 (7th Cir. 1997). This is particularly true when evidence shows that conditions in the home country have changed so dramatically as to undermine the well-foundedness of that fear. Id. In denying eligibility, the IJ relied on an advisory opinion from the BHRHA concluding that country conditions in Bulgaria “have so altered as to remove the presumption that past mistreatment in the Communist years will lead to mistreatment in the future.” Indeed, the 1999 U.S. Country Report on Bulgaria observes that “[t]here were no reports of any prosecutions for simple membership in [UMO Ilinden].” We have recognized State Department reports as authoritative sources on the current political situation in foreign states and, therefore, helpful in determining whether an asylum applicant’s fear of future persecution is well-founded. See Tamas-Mercea v. Reno, 222 F.3d 417, 423 (7th Cir.2000). Ivanov offered no equally credible source of information to rebut the State Department’s assessment of the likelihood of persecution under the current regime.
