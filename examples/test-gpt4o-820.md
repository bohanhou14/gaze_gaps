**Generation:**

In this case, plaintiffs allege that defendant not only made affirmative misrepresentations but also failed to disclose its intentions regarding the VTP, thereby breaching its fiduciary duties. As noted in Anweiler v. American Elec. Power Serv. Corp., a duty to disclose material information arises when fiduciaries’ silence is misleading (3 F.3d 986, 991). Similarly, in Eddy v. Colonial Life Ins. Co., the fiduciary’s technically accurate yet incomplete information was found misleading because it prevented the beneficiary from understanding their options (919 F.2d 747, 750-51, 108 F.3d 810). Moreover, cases like Stanton v. Gulf Oil Corp., make it clear that fiduciaries are not required to disclose non-adopted plan changes unless such non-disclosure is misleading (792 F.2d 432, 81 F.3d 275). 

Here, plaintiffs argue they were misled about the availability of the VTP and denied essential information that could have influenced their retirement decisions. This aligns with the precedents indicating that ERISA fiduciaries must avoid misleading plan participants, even by omission (927 F.2d 539, 46 F.3d 512). Therefore, defendant’s failure to disclose its intentions regarding the VTP in response to plaintiffs' direct inquiries could constitute a breach of fiduciary duties under ERISA.

gold_text: Defendant correctly points out that the Seventh Circuit has also stated that a fiducia ry does not have a duty to investigate and advise as to the circumstances of each individual employee. Chojnacki v. Georgici-Pa-cific Corp., 108 F.3d 810, 817-18 (7th Cir.1997). However, defendant is incorrect when it argues that Chojnacki somehow casts doubt on the employer’s duty to refrain from misleading its employees, whether by affirmative misrepresentation or by silence. The Seventh Circuit considered that Chojnacki was “easily distinguishable” from Anweiler and Eddy, on the ground that there was no misrepresentation in that case, since the statements made to the employees regarding future benefits were accurate. Id. at 817. See also Swinney v. General Motors Corp., 46 F.3d 512, 520-21 (6th Cir.1995) (employer did not breach its fiduciary duty where it stated truthfully that employees were not eligible for a voluntary termination package and subsequently changed its mind); Barnes v. Lacy, 927 F.2d 539, 544 (11th Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 938, 112 S.Ct. 372, 116 L.Ed.2d 324 (1991). While a fiduciary may not be required to volunteer information, Pocchia v. NYNEX Corp., 81 F.3d 275, 278 (2d Cir.1996), he or she must give complete and accurate information in response to participants’ questions. Drennan, 977 F.2d at 251. In this respect, the duty to disclose is the flip side of the duty to refrain from affirmative misrepresentations.
