The district court did not err in denying Nichols' motion for recusal of the district judge. Nichols failed to present specific facts showing a legitimate basis for recusal under 28 U.S.C. § 144 or 28 U.S.C. § 455. The standard for recusal requires that a reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts would question the judge's impartiality (United States v. Studley, 783 F.2d 934, 939 (9th Cir.1986); Reference case 109 F.3d 1450). Nichols did not provide evidence of “deep-seated favoritism that would make fair judgment impossible” (Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 554-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1157, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994); Reference case 109 F.3d 1450).

Additionally, the assertion that the judge is likely to be a material witness under 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(5)(iv) is without merit as there is no indication that the judge would be required to testify on any material fact in the case (543 F.3d 1038). The district court’s decision to deny the recusal motion was within its discretion and consistent with established legal principles (543 F.3d 1038; 109 F.3d 1450).

Given these findings, the ruling of the district court is 

AFFIRMED.

Arsenault, 543 F.3d 1038, 1043-44 (9th Cir.2008) (setting forth standard of review and grounds for recusal); United States v.
