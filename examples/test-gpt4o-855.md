The crux of the plaintiffs' argument rests upon the protections afforded by the First Amendment, particularly in the realm of political speech. Limiting contributions infringes upon the freedom of expression and association, overlapping and blending the two rights, making any impediment on association an impermissible restraint on expression (454 U.S. 290). Furthermore, the Supreme Court has underscored the necessity of lifting restrictions on independent expenditures, as such limitations have a substantial and direct impact on political expression, which cannot be tolerated under the First Amendment (427 U.S. 347). Given that FFLF's independent operation forecloses any risk of quid pro quo corruption, the restrictions imposed by La.R.S. 18:1505.2(K) are not justifiable. Hence, FFLF’s constitutional challenge succeeds, warranting a permanent injunction to uphold its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, preventing irreparable harm through continued enforcement threats.

FFLF’s “ability to speak is undoubtedly limited when it cannot raise money to pay for speech.” See Texans for Free Enter., 732 F.3d at 539. The relief FFLF seeks would fill the gap that exists in the state campaign finance law, which pre-dates Citizens United and its progeny and does not define, or exclude from the law’s reach, independent expenditure-only committees. FFLF has established irreparable injury that cannot be compensated with post-election relief or after-the-fact money damages.
