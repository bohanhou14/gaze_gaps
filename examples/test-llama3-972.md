The case at hand involves a skilled nursing facility, Neighbors Rehabilitation Center, which was assessed a civil monetary penalty by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for inadequately addressing sexual interactions between three cognitively impaired residents. The penalty was $83,800, and Neighbors appealed the citation and penalty to the Departmental Appeals Board.

In reviewing the Agency's determination, we must determine whether the conclusion is supported by substantial evidence. The key issue is whether Neighbors' handling of the sexual interactions was inadequate or hazardous under then-regulation 42 C.F.R. ยง 483.25(h). Neighbors argues that its policies were sufficient to monitor residents' sexual interactions, but the record shows that staff did not investigate whether the interactions were consensual or whether the residents had the capacity to consent.

The Departmental Appeals Board noted that the citation was primarily supported by what Neighbors' staff did not do, such as not talking to residents about their feelings regarding the interactions, not documenting the residents' capacity for consent, and not discussing the developments with residents' responsible parties and/or families. This lack of investigation and follow-up is similar to the scenario in Rosewood Care Ctr. of Swansea v. Price, 868 F.3d 731 (7th Cir. 2017), where the court held that a facility's failure to investigate and address allegations of sexual abuse was a violation of regulations.

In United States v. Johnson, 743 F.3d 196 (7th Cir. 2014), the court held that a facility's failure to provide adequate care and supervision to a resident who was vulnerable to harm was a violation of regulations. Similarly, in this case, Neighbors failed to provide adequate care and supervision to the residents by not investigating and addressing the sexual interactions.

The Agency's determination is supported by substantial evidence, and we affirm the citation and penalty. Neighbors' handling of the sexual interactions was inadequate and hazardous, and the facility failed to provide adequate care and supervision to the residents.

gold_text: The ALJ repeatedly highlighted the serious cognitive deficits of R2 and R3 (which were documented in the record) and observed that these deficits created an even greater need to investigate whether any abuse was taking place. Yet the record reflects that no such investigation occurred. Neighbors would have us hold that it is appropriate to presume consent as long as there is no resistance. To do so would be to hold persons with dementia and Alzheimer's to a higher standard than we hold the average person. See, e.g. , United States v. Johnson , 743 F.3d 196, 199 n.1 (7th Cir. 2014) (noting that, under Illinois law, resistance is not necessary to prove sexual assault); see also United States v. Cobenais , 868 F.3d 731, 740 (8th Cir. 2017) (noting that, under 18 U.S.C. ยง 2241(a), the government need not show that a sexual abuse victim resisted).
