Petitioners argue that their counsel's performance was ineffective, rendering their trial fundamentally unfair. However, the mere incompetence or negligence of appointed counsel does not amount to a violation of the Sixth Amendment unless it creates an extreme case where the trial becomes a farce and mockery of justice (148 F.2d 667). The record, reviewed under the permissive scope of habeas corpus, shows that petitioners were not deprived of due process since they were afforded representation and the opportunity to cross-examine critical witnesses, as in the case where no specific prejudice resulted from the chosen military defense counsel (133 F.2d 528).

Petitioners also contend there was insufficient evidence leading to their conviction. In habeas corpus proceedings, courts generally cannot overturn judgments based on mere trial errors or insufficient evidence unless there is a complete lack of evidence to support jurisdiction (153 F.2d 834). Here, the deposition of Rhinefield, supplemented by stipulations and documentary evidence, sufficed to provide the tribunal with "power and authority to act," thus not warranting release on jurisdictional grounds (153 F.2d 834; 133 F.2d 528).

Considering the presence of a legally sufficient record and proper adherence to procedural rights, the petitioners' detention does not violate constitutional standards, following established precedents and permissible scope of judicial review.

gold_text: But regardless of what has been suggested or said, this court shares the view stated by the Circuit Court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Romero v. Squier, 133 F.2d 528, 531, 532 that an Army officer, admitted by a court-martial to practice the arts of a military defense, need not also be admitted to practice by some civil court and, when chosen by the litigant and accepted by the court-martial “to prosecute or defend litigation there, is the same kind of officer at the bar of that court as is one entitled to practice at the bar of any other court.” Moreover, the court record imports absolute verity, Thomas v. Hunter, 10 Cir., 153 F.2d 834; and it shows that these petitioners voluntarily elected to have Lt. Stout defend them. They were therefore bound by his acts and agreements, however inept, since no fraud, collusioh or corruption by him has either been alleged or proved. Cf. Altmayer v. Sanford, 5 Cir., 148 F.2d 161; Diggs v. Welch, 80 U.S. App.D.C. 5, 148 F.2d 667, 670. Whether he did, or failed to do, something which petitioners and learned counsel presently representing them think was improper or unwise is beside the point. As Judge Murrah of this (the Tenth) Circuit recently said, speaking for the court in Moss v. Hunter, 167 F.2d 683, 684, certiorari denied June 21, 1948, 334 U.S. 860, 68 S.Ct. 1519, 92 L.Ed. 1780:
