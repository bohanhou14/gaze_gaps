The primary issue in this case is whether the Small Business Administration's (SBA) decision to determine that Dani and Kennedy, franchisees of Norrell, are not small businesses is arbitrary and capricious. The SBA found that the franchisees were not independent entities due to the restraints provided for in the franchise agreement.

The court has already held that an agency's interpretation of its own regulations will be accepted unless it is plainly wrong (General Carbon Co. v. Occupational Safety and Health Rev. Comm'n, 860 F.2d 479, 483 (D.C.Cir.1988)). The SBA's interpretation of its regulations is reasonable and supported by the facts on the record.

The franchise agreement provides that Norrell has control over various aspects of the franchisees' business, including employees and billings. This is sufficient evidence of common management, which is a factor in determining control. (Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965)).

The SBA's determination was also based on the fact that the franchisees' rights in the relationship with Norrell were those associated with an agent, rather than an independent owner. (Hispanic Information & Telecommunications Network v. FCC, 865 F.2d 1289, 1296 (D.C.Cir.1989)).

In conclusion, the SBA's decision was not arbitrary and capricious. The agency's interpretation of its regulations is reasonable and supported by the facts on the record. The franchise agreement provides sufficient evidence of common management and control, and the SBA's determination was based on relevant factors.

This case is similar to Reference case 900 F.2d 318, in which the court held that the Secretary's interpretation of the Mine Act was controlling weight unless it was plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. Similarly, in Reference case 325 U.S. 410, the court held that the Administrator's interpretation of the regulation was controlling weight unless it was plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.

gold_text: An agency’s “interpretation of its own regulations is of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.” Secretary of Labor v. Western Fuels-Utah, 900 F.2d 318, 321 (D.C.Cir.1990) quoting Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., 325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945); Hispanic Information and Telecommunications Network v. FCC, 865 F.2d 1289, 1296 (D.C.Cir. 1989). The SBA’s interpretation and application of its regulations is clearly consistent both with the plain meaning of those regulations and with its Congressional mandate. Because that interpretation is in no way plainly erroneous, it must be given deference by this Court.
