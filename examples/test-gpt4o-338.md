In the present case, the thrust of petitioner’s argument parallels that of Alvin B. Lowe, asserting that any gain should be viewed as a capital adjustment rather than ordinary income. However, as established in reference case 50 T.C. 273, a gain realized from a completed transaction distinctly impacts tax treatment. Here, it is evident that Mr. Glassman’s forfeiture did not signify a completed sale but rather liquidated damages stemming from the memorandum agreement default, thus aligning with the principle in Ralph A. Boatman, 32 T.C. 1188.

Moreover, petitioner’s characterization of the payment is undermined by the decision in A. M. Johnson, 32 B.T.A. 156, highlighting the premise that uncompleted sales transactions yielding liquidated damages classify such gains as ordinary income. Therefore, consistent with these precedents, it is manifest that the $19,817 received due to Mr. Glassman’s withdrawal should be taxed as ordinary income.

Accordingly, in light of the evidence and applicable precedents, the petitioner's claim for capital gain treatment must be rejected, supporting our holding that the gain constitutes ordinary income.

gold_text: In our opinion, tMs case is distinguishable from Lowe. Here, no sale took place; there was merely a contract by the petitioner to sell stock to Mr. Glassman. The gain realized by the petitioner in 1963 resulted from the operation of paragraph 3 of the memorandum. Under that provision, if Mr. Glassman did not remain with the cor porations until be completed paying for bis interest in the stock, only a portion of the payments made by him were to be returned to him. In effect, the portion not returned to Mr. Glassman constituted liquidated damages payable as a result of bis failure to complete the purchase of Stock under the memorandum. On a number of occasions, we have held that such gain does not result from the sale or exchange of a capital asset and therefore must be treated as ordinary income. Harold S. Smith, 50 T.C. 273 (1968), affirmed per curiam 418 F. 2d 573 (C.A. 9, 1969); Ralph A. Boatman, 32 T.C. 1188 (1959); A. M. Johnson, 32 B.T.A. 156 (1935).
