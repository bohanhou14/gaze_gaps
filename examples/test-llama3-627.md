Here is the continuation of the case:

E.
In determining the validity of Wardrick’s sentence as an “armed career criminal,” we review de novo the district court’s legal determinations and for clear error its factual findings. United States v. Daughtrey, 874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir.1989). We have examined Wardrick’s prior convictions, and we agree with the district court that at least four of them constituted violent felonies under ACCA.

First, Wardrick’s 1983 Maryland conviction for common-law assault, which involved a threat by words or acts to do bodily harm to another, coupled with the apparent present ability to carry out the threat, constituted a violent felony. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Second, his 1984 Maryland conviction for escape, which involved a serious risk of physical injury to another, also qualified as a violent felony. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Third, his 1986 Maryland conviction for common-law battery, which required the use of physical force against the person of another, was a violent felony. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Fourth, his 1988 Maryland conviction for resisting arrest, which involved a serious risk of physical injury to another, was also a violent felony. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).

After considering the totality of the circumstances, including Wardrick’s violent criminal history, we affirm the district court’s determination that he was properly sentenced as an “armed career criminal” under ACCA.

In conclusion, we affirm the district court’s denial of Wardrick’s motion to suppress the evidence seized during the execution of the search warrant and his challenge to the warrant’s validity. We also affirm the district court’s determination that Wardrick was properly sentenced as an “armed career criminal” under ACCA.

Wardrick’s claims are without merit, and we deny his petition for appeal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.



citations: ['71 F.3d 115', '983 F.2d 1306']

gold_text: The district court also properly characterized Wardrick’s 1984 Maryland conviction for escape as a violent felony. As we have indicated, felony escape and attempted escape constitute violent felonies under ACCA- — even if accomplished by stealth. See generally United States v. Hairston, 71 F.3d 115 (4th Cir.1995) (holding felony escape in North Carolina to be crime of violence under ACCA because escape presents risk of injury to others); United States v. Aragon, 983 F.2d 1306, 1313 (4th Cir.1993) (holding attempt to rescue prisoner and assisting in escape to be crimes of violence because of inherent risk of force).
