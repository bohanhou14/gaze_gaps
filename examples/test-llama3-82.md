The cases provided highlight the importance of jurisdictional requirements in federal courts. In Reference Case 372 F.2d 817, the court held that local boards lacked authority to reclassify registrants for participating in a Vietnam War protest, as jurisdiction over offenses of this character is exclusively granted to the District Courts.

In Reference Case 405 U.S. 538, the court addressed the conflict between 28 U.S.C. § 1343 (3) and 28 U.S.C. § 1331, concluding that the supposed conflict does not exist. The court further emphasized that the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2), only grants jurisdiction over claims against the United States for money damages not exceeding $10,000, and does not extend to suits for equitable relief.

In Reference Case 92 S. Ct. 1113, the court ruled that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) does not provide an independent basis of jurisdiction. The court noted that mandamus jurisdiction lies when the act of a federal official, although authorized by statute, is alleged to violate the Constitution, but only when there is a clear statutory duty.

In the case at hand, plaintiffs assert that mandamus lies when the act of a federal official, although authorized by statute, is alleged to violate the Constitution, specifically the due process provision of the Fifth Amendment. However, the court concludes that mandamus does not lie in the absence of a clear statutory duty. The court also notes that the plaintiffs have not supported their allegations of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1361.

Finally, the court addresses the issue of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331(a), concluding that the matter in controversy exceeds $10,000 exclusive of interests and costs, but only if plaintiffs are entitled to survivor annuity benefits under § 8341(a)(3) (A). Thus, it appears to be a legal certainty that plaintiffs individually cannot recover the requisite jurisdictional amount.

In conclusion, the cases provided emphasize the importance of jurisdictional requirements in federal courts. The court's analysis highlights the need for a clear statutory duty and the threshold amount in controversy required for jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331(a).

gold_text: Cases such as the instant case, in which federal authorities allegedly interfere with rights guaranteed by the Constitution, are, as Judge Medina characterized them in Wolff v. Selective Service Local Board No. 16, 372 F.2d 817, 826 (2d Cir. 1967), “an unfortunate gap in the statutory jurisdiction of the federal courts . . . .” However, the Supreme Court in Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 547, 92 S. Ct. 1113, 1119, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972), dealt with this very problem stating:
