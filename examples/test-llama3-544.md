In the case of Companhia Hidro Eléctrica do Sao Francisco v. Companhia de Navegacao Lloyd Brasileiro, the court is faced with determining whether the six Westinghouse gas circuit breakers, which were partially packaged and mounted on a steel base, constituted a "package" within the meaning of § 4(5) of the United States Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA).

The court cites Aluminios Pozuelo Ltd. v. S.S. Navigator, 407 F.2d 152 (2d Cir. 1968), which defines a "package" as a class of cargo that has undergone some packaging preparation for transportation, which facilitates handling, but does not necessarily conceal or completely enclose the goods. The court also references Nichimen Company v. M.V. Farland, 462 F.2d 319 (2d Cir. 1972), which states that the parties must abide by the description of the items in the bill of lading, which in this case specified "NO. OF PKGS — 6".

The court concludes that the circuit breakers, which were at least partially packaged and mounted on a steel base, constituted a "package" within the meaning of § 4(5) of COGSA. The court's reasoning is based on the fact that the base served primarily to facilitate delivery and make the circuit breakers an article "put up * * * in a form suitable for transportation or handling".

In the reference case 451 F.2d 24, the court held that the limitation of liability provision in the bill of lading, which stated that the carrier's liability for loss or damage to cargo was limited to $500 per "package", was enforceable. The court in the present case follows this precedent and holds that the carrier's liability for the damaged circuit breakers is limited to $500 per "package".

In conclusion, the court in Companhia Hidro Eléctrica do Sao Francisco v. Companhia de Navegacao Lloyd Brasileiro held that the six Westinghouse gas circuit breakers, which were partially packaged and mounted on a steel base, constituted a "package" within the meaning of § 4(5) of COGSA, and that the carrier's liability for the damaged circuit breakers was limited to $500 per "package

gold_text: In other words packaging for protection, whether complete or partial, should be considered as constituting a package within § 4(5) of COGSA. The Court of Appeals has recognized that packaging may serve a dual purpose so that the existence of another purpose “does not necessarily negate the possibility that it is also packaging preparation made to facilitate handling in transportation.” Nichimen Company v. M.V. Farland, supra, 462 F.2d 319, 334; but see General Motors Corporation v. S.S. Mormacoak, 327 F.Supp. 666 (S.D.N.Y.), aff’d on other grounds, General Motors Corporation v. Moore-McCormack Lines, 451 F.2d 24 (2d Cir. 1971).
