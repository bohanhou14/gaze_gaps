In the context of bankruptcy law, a threshold issue is whether a court has jurisdiction to hear a particular case. In this regard, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has held that a court of appeals has jurisdiction only over final judgments and orders arising from a bankruptcy proceeding, whereas the district court may review interlocutory judgments and orders as well. (In re Walker, 515 F.3d 1204, 1210 (11th Cir.2008); 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)).

In the case of 532 F.3d 1134, the court considered whether the denial of a motion to dismiss for abuse was a final appealable order. The court held that the order was not final because it did not completely resolve all of the issues pertaining to a discrete claim, including issues as to the proper relief. (In re Atlas, 210 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2000)).

On the other hand, in the case of 866 F.2d 1372, the court considered whether a collateral bankruptcy order was reviewable. The court held that the order was reviewable because it met the criteria set forth in In re Regency, which requires that the order be independent and easily separable from the substance of other claims in the action, present a need to secure prompt review in order to protect important interests of any party, and be examined in light of practical, rather than narrowly technical considerations. (In re Regency, 686 F.2d 902 (11th Cir.1982)).

In conclusion, the jurisdiction of a court in a bankruptcy case depends on the type of order or judgment being appealed. Courts of appeals have jurisdiction only over final judgments and orders arising from a bankruptcy proceeding, whereas district courts may review interlocutory judgments and orders as well. The reviewability of a collateral bankruptcy order depends on whether it meets the criteria set forth in In re Regency. (866 F.2d 1372)
