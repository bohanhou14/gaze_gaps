This Court's ruling aligns with the precedent set forth in other cases addressing control over documents held by related corporate entities. In 194 F.R.D. 469, the Court presumes control where a sister corporation has access to documents in the ordinary course of business, despite SECO's failure to show such access. Similarly, this Court finds that Infineon NA has demonstrated sufficient control over documents held by Infineon AG.

Assuming such access is consistent with the rationale in Cooper, 102 F.R.D. 918, where control was found because the subsidiary had regular access to the documents in question. In this case, Infineon NA's integrated business operations and shared database system with Infineon AG strengthen the argument for presumed control.

Furthermore, the need for detailed affidavits as delineated in 102 F.R.D. 918 emphasizes the necessity for transparency in efforts to locate documents. Infineon NA must thus submit a similar affidavit detailing the steps taken if it cannot locate the documents sought by Choice. This ensures accountability and thoroughness in compliance with this order.

In conclusion, based on the factual background and procedurals similar to the referenced cases, it is clear that Infineon NA is obligated to produce documents in Infineon AG’s possession relevant to WMAC technologies while irrelevant documents regarding the PHY chip remain excluded.

gold_text: During oral argument, counsel for third-party Infineon NA cited Securities and Exchange Commission v. Credit Bancorp 194 F.R.D. 469 (S.D.N.Y.2000) for the proposition that it should not be required to produce documents on behalf of Infineon AG. The language relied upon by counsel for Infineon first appeared in Cooper v. British Aerospace 102 F.R.D. 918 (S.D.N.Y.1984), in which the court required an American corporation to produce documents on behalf of its British affiliate because it was “inconceivable that defendant would not have access to [the] documents and the ability to obtain them for its usual business.” Id., at 919-920 (S.D.N.Y.1984). The court in Cooper based its decision, in part, on the fact that the American corporation was the distributor and servicer of the British affiliate’s product in the United States.
