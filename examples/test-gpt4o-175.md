The defendant's reliance on the claim of coercion by his former counsel is unsubstantiated. Notably, in a comparable context, the case of Chandler v. United States, 171 F.2d 921, affirms the thoroughness and diligence of legal representation as critical. The defendant's counsel, in this instance, provided ample advisement and meticulously prepared a defense.

Furthermore, in alignment with Robert H. Best's case (184 F.2d 131), this court concludes that there is no merit in the argument that coercion or misrepresentation invalidated the plea. Best's conviction was sustained despite claims of coercion, as the court weighed detailed testimonies and affidavits from involved counsel, similar to our present case.

Upon reviewing all evidence, including defendant's voluminous affidavits and testimonies, it is evident that the defense counsel acted with due diligence and competence. Hence, the motion is denied, and the original conviction stands.
