The case at hand involves a dispute between Louis Marx & Co. (Marx) and Buddy L Corporation (Buddy L) over the infringement of a typewriter patent. Marx owns patent number 3,338,369, which was issued to W. E. Rexford and claims a flat piece consisting of three intersecting arms lying in a common plane. Buddy L's Easy Writer typewriter allegedly infringes on this patent. The Court found that the patent was invalid due to obviousness, citing the Burridge patent, which discloses a three-armed key lever with a similar design. The Court also found that Buddy L's Easy Writer does not infringe on the Kuramochi patent, which was another patent claimed by Marx.

In determining the question of obviousness, the Court applied the test established in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1 (1966), which considers the scope and content of the prior art, differences between the prior art and the claims at issue, and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art. The Court found that the invention was obvious at the time it was made and that the patent was invalid.

In its application for attorneys' fees, Buddy L argued that Marx's patent claims were so obviously devoid of substance that the company could not have had a bona fide belief in their validity. However, the Court found that Marx had a legitimate reason to rely on the presumption of validity of the patent and that the company was not acting in bad faith.

In conclusion, the Court's decision in this case is consistent with the principles established in reference cases such as 172 F.2d 150 and 523 F.2d 288. The Court's application of the obviousness test and its finding that the patent was invalid due to obviousness are also consistent with the guidance provided in Graham v. John Deere Co. (1966).

gold_text: . Plaintiffs primary challenge to the Court’s earlier disposition is on the unfair competition claim. See note 3 supra. Post trial, plaintiff became “aware of several court decisions,” changed its theory and argued that Buddy L had appropriated Marx’s trade secrets and was liable therefor for unjust enrichment whether or not it had knowledge, relying primarily upon Conmar Prods. Corp. v. Universal Slide Fastener, 172 F.2d 150 (2d Cir. 1949), and Koehring Co. v. National Automatic Tool Co., 257 F.Supp. 282 (S.D.Ind.1966), aff’d, 385 F.2d 414 (7th Cir. 1967) (per curiam), both cases involving trade secrets. Aside from plaintiff’s total failure to introduce any evidence whatsoever concerning the existence of any trade secrets in connection with the Marxwriter parts, neither case supports the plaintiffs position. Koehring was decided under Indiana law and involved that defendant’s hiring of plaintiffs former employees. In Conmar, concerning a fact situation similar to that in Koehring, the Court permitted recovery only for the defendant’s use of plaintiff’s trade secrets for the period after he learned of the employee’s breach of the secrecy agreement with plaintiff. Thus, even in Conmar, knowledge is essential, and as indicated in note 3 supra, plaintiff did not prove knowledge. Finally, any recovery under a Con-mar theory would be cut off as of the time that plaintiff offered the product embodying the trade secret for public sale. See Timely Prods. Corp. v. Arron, 523 F.2d 288, 304 (2d Cir. 1975); Conmar, supra, 172 F.2d at 155-56.
