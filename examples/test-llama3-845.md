I respectfully disagree with the panel majority's analysis. The issue at hand is whether Slocum Construction, L.L.C. ("Slocum") has a duty to defend against Robert Youngblood's counterclaim for willful trespass. Under Mississippi law, an insurer has no duty to defend an intentional tort. Youngblood's counterclaim alleges that Slocum intentionally and knowingly trespassed on his property. This is not an accident or an "occurrence" under Slocum's insurance policy.

In Delta Pride Catfish, Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., 697 So.2d 400, 403 (Miss.1997), the Mississippi Supreme Court held that an insurer has no duty to defend a claim outside the coverage of the policy. Similarly, in Architex Ass'n, Inc. v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., 27 So.3d 1148, 1161 (Miss.2010), the court noted that an insurer has no duty to defend intentional torts.

The panel majority incorrectly relies on Allstate Ins. Co. v. Moulton, 464 So.2d 507, 510 (Miss.1985), and United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Omnibank, 812 So.2d 196, 202 (Miss.2002), to argue that Slocum's intentional act of building the house was still an "occurrence" under the policy. However, these cases are distinguishable because they involved negligent or unintentional acts, not intentional torts.

In conclusion, Slocum has no duty to defend against Youngblood's counterclaim for willful trespass. The policy only covers accidents or unintentional acts, and Youngblood's counterclaim alleges intentional and knowing trespass. Therefore, the district court's summary judgment is affirmed.
