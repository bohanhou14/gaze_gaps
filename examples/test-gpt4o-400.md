The government's evidence, coupled with corroborating testimony, was sufficient to show Anthony's conspiracy with Ward Price and the other named defendants. The jury's evaluation of witness credibility is paramount, and it found Louis' testimony credible despite defense assertions to the contrary.

Anthony's argument regarding the omission of the term "cocaine base" at trial fails under plain error review. The appellate court found that the interchangeable use of "cocaine," "crack," and "cocaine base" was understood by all parties, thus dismissing this point of error in line with United States v. Pinto, 905 F.2d 47 (4th Cir.1990), and similar rulings (928 F.2d 365).

Regarding evidence exclusion, the trial court rightly rejected the "mentally unbalanced" notation absent its author's testimony to establish a rational basis for the opinion per Fed.R.Evid. 701. Our case law supports that only testimony following a proper foundation can be admissible (909 F.2d 1443; United States v. Madrid, 673 F.2d 1114).

Anthony's final ground for appeal concerns Rule 32(c)(3)(D) compliance in his sentencing. The district court followed procedural mandates appropriately, referencing in camera materials and affirmed the presentence report's factual findings. As per United States v. Strayer, 846 F.2d 1262 (10th Cir.1988), the court must either validate the challenged evidence or state its irrelevance, which was adhered to in this instance.

Thus, we find no reversible error in the district court's proceedings.

gold_text: From the record before us it would appear that the district court did not make the findings or determinations required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D). In United States v. Alvarado, 909 F.2d 1443, 1445 (10th Cir.1990), decided after sentence was imposed in the instant case, we held that Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D) requires that when a defendant challenges information in his presentence report, the district court must either make a factual finding regarding the accuracy of the challenged information or expressly state that in imposing sentence he is not taking into consideration the challenged statement. In Alvarado, we remanded for resentencing, commenting that such findings or determinations must be made not only for use by the correctional system, but also so that “we know the facts upon which the district judge relie[d].” Id. at 1445. See also United States v. Forker, 928 F.2d 365 (11th Cir.1991) (citing Alvarado).
