The case at hand involves the admission of a deposition from a civil proceeding in a subsequent criminal trial. The court held that the deposition was inadmissible under both Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) and the Confrontation Clause.

The court found that the defendants did not have a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine the witness, Sanburg, at the deposition. The witness had agreed to testify against the defendants in exchange for immunity, and the defendants were not aware of this agreement at the time of the deposition. The court also found that the deposition was not admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) because the parties did not have a similar motive to develop the testimony at the deposition and the stakes were different.

The court further held that the admission of the deposition violated the Confrontation Clause because there was no guarantee of the witness's credibility. The witness's testimony was self-serving, and the court found that the government had not disclosed all the consideration it had held out to the witness.

In addition, the court held that the trial was held too quickly, violating the Speedy Trial Act. The new indictment added new counts, including a RICO count and a forfeiture count, which required additional preparation time for the defense.

The court also addressed several other issues, including alleged improper closing arguments by the prosecutor, comments on the defendant's failure to testify, and the admission of prior similar acts. However, it found no error in these matters.

Overall, the court ruled that the deposition was not admissible and that the trial was held too quickly, requiring a new trial. The decision is consistent with the holdings in cases such as Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, and United States ex rel. Haywood v. Wolff, 658 F.2d 455.

gold_text: The Sanburg deposition was the heart of the prosecution’s case against the co-defendants. At the time of the deposition, however, no criminal charges were pending against Feldman and Martenson, they had no reason to suspect that they should cross-examine Sanburg, and there was no party at the deposition who could be deemed a predecessor in interest to Feldman or Martenson. The trial court therefore erred in admitting the deposition under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1). The admission of the deposition also violated the Confrontation Clause because the deposition did not bear sufficient indicia of reliability as articulated in Ohio v. Roberts, 1980, 448 U.S. 56, 65-66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, 607-08, and in United States ex rel. Haywood v. Wolff, 7 Cir.1981, 658 F.2d 455, 463, cert. denied, 1981, 454 U.S. 1088, 102 S.Ct. 649, 70 L.Ed.2d 625. We therefore reverse the convictions of the defendants. We also find reversible error in the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(2) (1982) because the RICO count in the new indictment pushed the indictment beyond the “same offense” contemplated in id, § 3161(h)(6). We reject the co-defendants’ remaining arguments on appeal. The convictions of the co-defendants are therefore REVERSED and the cause REMANDED for a new trial consistent with this opinion.
