In the context of the legal cases, the concept of "private education" and "compulsory attendance" is a crucial aspect of the debate. In the case of 411 U.S. 1, the court held that the state's compulsory attendance statute was unconstitutional because it did not provide for the right of parents to educate their children privately. In contrast, the case of 268 U.S. 510 held that the state's compulsory attendance statute was constitutional because it did not interfere with the right of parents to educate their children privately.

In the case at hand, the plaintiffs seek to challenge the constitutionality of the Illinois Compulsory Attendance Act, which requires children to attend public school. The plaintiffs argue that this statute infringes upon their fundamental right to educate their children privately and in accordance with their own beliefs and values. They argue that this right is protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

The court must carefully consider the plaintiffs' arguments and weigh them against the state's interest in providing a compulsory education to its citizens. The court must also consider the precedent set by previous cases, such as Pierce v. Society of Sisters, which held that the state's compulsory attendance statute was constitutional because it did not interfere with the right of parents to educate their children privately.

In conclusion, the court must carefully consider the plaintiffs' arguments and the precedent set by previous cases in order to make a determination on the constitutionality of the Illinois Compulsory Attendance Act. The court must balance the plaintiffs' interest in educating their children privately with the state's interest in providing a compulsory education to its citizens. Ultimately, the court must determine whether the statute is reasonable and constitutional under the United States Constitution.

gold_text: In Count II, plaintiffs claim that the statute deprives them of equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment as applied to them, in that defendants distinguish between parents who educate their children in either a public or institutional private school, and those who, like plaintiffs, educate their children privately at home. It is true that defendants administratively presume that parents who educate their children at home are in violation of the statute. Plaintiffs do not assert, however, that this distinction operates to the peculiar disadvantage of any suspect class. Moreover, it should be clear, for the reasons stated above and in accord with the recent Supreme Court decision in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 29-39, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973), that the defendants’ actions do not interfere with the exercise of any “fundamental” right. In Rodriguez, the court held that education is not a constitutionally protected fundamental right, the impingement of which would necessitate subjecting the State’s action to strict judicial scrutiny. This court need therefore apply only the traditional standard of review, which “requires only that the State’s system be shown to bear some rational relationship to legitimate state purposes.” 411 U.S. at 40, 93 S.Ct. at 1300. It is clear that the State is empowered to reasonably “regulate all schools, to inspect, supervise and examine them, their teachers and pupils.” Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925). The distinction in treatment by the State between parents who send their children to institutional schools and those who educate them at home directly relates to the difficulty that the State would surely face in supervising, at considerable expense, a host of facilities and individuals, widely scattered, who might undertake to instruct their children at home; as compared with the less difficult and expensive supervision of teachers and facilities in organized public and private schools, moreover, the legislature might have concluded that institutional private schools are under the direct supervision of their school authorities at all times, and their students would thus presumptively qualify for the statutory exemption. People v. Turner, 121 Cal.App.2d Supp. 861, 263 P.2d 685 (1953), appeal dismissed, 347 U.S. 972, 74 S.Ct. 785, 98 L.Ed. 1112 (1954); State v. Hoyt, 84 N.H.38, 146 A. 170 (1929).
