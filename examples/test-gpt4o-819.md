In determining whether the Plaintiffs' tortious interference claim can avoid mandatory abstention under 28 U.S.C. § 1334(c)(2), the Court turns to Section 1367(a), which governs supplemental jurisdiction. According to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), district courts have supplemental jurisdiction over all claims that are so related to the original claims that they form part of the same case or controversy. The application of this principle to bankruptcy jurisdiction has been explicitly recognized (see Publicker Indus. v. United States, 980 F.2d 110, 114-15 (2d Cir.1992); In re TXNB Internal Case, 483 F.3d 292, 300 (5th Cir.2007)).

In Edge’s case, the Fifth Circuit underscored the breadth of federal jurisdiction when bankruptcy claims are involved, outlining the non-applicability of abstention where claims are integral to the core bankruptcy proceedings (483 F.3d 292).

Similarly, Walker v. Cadle Co. (In re Walker), 51 F.3d 562 (5th Cir.1995) established that bankruptcy courts might not exercise supplemental jurisdiction, aligning with the principles set forth in Section 1334(b). Here, ADP asserts that the intertwining nature of the Plaintiffs' state law claims and the Trustee’s bankruptcy claims provide an independent basis for jurisdiction under Section 1367(a), justifying abstention refusal (483 F.3d 292).

Moreover, the Court notes that this aligns with the principles of supplemental jurisdiction described in other federal statutes (28 U.S.C. § 1367(a) and (c); McCoy v. Webster, 47 F.3d 404, 406 n. 3 (11th Cir. 1995); 198 B.R. 401). Given these considerations, the Plaintiffs' request for mandatory abstention under 28 U.S.C. § 1334(c)(2) is unsupported.

Accordingly, the Motion to Abstain is DENIED.

Although the section addresses jurisdiction over closely related claims, it is not clear that this provision for supplemental jurisdiction extends to the Bankruptcy Court.
