The case discussed in the reference articles appears to be a trade adjustment assistance (TAA) case, where the plaintiff is seeking certification for trade adjustment assistance benefits. The plaintiff alleges that the increased imports of "articles like or directly competitive" with articles produced at the Marion plant caused his unemployment.

After reviewing the administrative record, the court concludes that the Secretary's denial of certification for the production workers other than those in Departments 225 and 230 is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. However, the court remands the case regarding the service workers to the Secretary for redetermination, as the evidence does not support the Secretary's determination that the service workers' contribution to the certified departments is significantly less than 25 percent of their contribution to the entire plant.

Regarding the plaintiff's allegations of unequal protection, the court finds that the Secretary's determination does not result in dissimilar treatment of similarly situated workers without a rational basis. The court concludes that the Secretary's determination is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.

In another case, Bennett v. United States Secretary of Labor, the court addressed the issue of whether the Department of Labor's negative determination denying certification for trade adjustment assistance eligibility was supported by substantial evidence. The court found that the Department's determination was based on substantial evidence and was in accordance with law.

The court also addressed the issue of whether the Department's methodology was flawed, and found that the Department's efforts to interview witnesses and collect data were sufficient to support its determination.

In conclusion, the cases discussed in the reference articles demonstrate the importance of reviewing the administrative record and ensuring that the determination is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. The cases also highlight the need for a nuanced approach to determining the eligibility for trade adjustment assistance benefits, taking into account the specific circumstances of each case.

gold_text: Plaintiff was a support service worker to Allied Signal’s production and therefore was not a production worker himself. Citing Abbott v. Donovan, 6 CIT 92, 570 F. Supp. 41 (1983), Labor argues that service workers such as plaintiff are eligible for certification when (1) their separation is caused by a reduced demand for their services from a production department whose workers independently meet the statutory criteria for certification, and (2) the reduction directly relates to the import-impacted article. Labor points to the overall decrease in military imports to establish that the requirement of increased imports under 19 U.S.C. § 2272(a)(3) could not have been met. Furthermore, even if relevant commercial imports had increased, the [ ] in Allied Signal’s commercial sales would have failed the requirement of decreased sales under 19 U.S.C. § 2272(a)(2). These two factors demonstrate that no independent certification of production workers could have obtained. In addition, the small amount of production diverted to Singapore and the shift in reliance from in-house tool workers to domestic subcontractors reinforce the fact that imports did not contribute importantly to plaintiffs separation.
