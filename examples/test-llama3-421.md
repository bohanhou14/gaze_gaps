PER CURIAM:

We affirm the district court's decision to impose a sentence of 235 months' imprisonment on defendant Brandon Bivins. Bivins was convicted of possessing a firearm and ammunition after being convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g).

The district court's sentencing decision was procedurally sound, and the sentence was substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. The court considered the ยง 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the kinds of sentences available. The court also gave due deference to the district court's decision that the ยง 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justified the extent of the variance from the guidelines range.

The sentence was within the guidelines range, and the court did not apply a presumption of unreasonableness. Under Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the court may consider the extent of any variance from the guidelines range, but must give due deference to the district court's decision.

In this case, the district court's sentence was reasonable given the circumstances. Bivins had a significant criminal history, including prior convictions for violent felonies and drug offenses. The court also considered the seriousness of the offense, the need to deter criminal conduct, and the need to protect the public. The sentence was not outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.

Accordingly, we affirm the district court's sentence of 235 months' imprisonment. United States v. Tome, 611 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.2010), cert. denied, - U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2587, 183 L.Ed.2d 547 (2012).

gold_text: Bivins does not challenge his guidelines calculations, but Bivins does argue that his 235-month sentence was substantively unreasonable. We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A defendant challenging his sentence bears the burden of showing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the ยง 3553(a) factors. United States v. Tome, 611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). Although this Court does not presume that a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a within-guidelines range sentence will be deemed reasonable. United States v. Gonzalez, 550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).
