We look to the allegations in the complaint to determine whether NBCI has a duty to defend. The factual allegations of the complaint determine whether that duty arises, as established in Delta Pride Catfish, Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., 697 So.2d 400, 403 (Miss.1997). In the underlying case, Youngblood's countersuit against Slocum is for trespass, which is an intentional tort under Mississippi law that requires entering another’s property without right for one’s own purpose (Saucier v. Biloxi Reg’l Med. Ctr., 708 So.2d 1351, 1357 (Miss.1998)). Therefore, to trigger coverage under the policy, Slocum must have accidentally committed trespass, analogous to the ruling in Architex Ass’n, Inc. v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., 27 So.3d 1148, 1159 (Miss.2010).

However, Slocum's actions were intentional, even if based on mistaken ownership, akin to the “negligent actions that are intentionally caused by the insured” as noted in OmniBank, 812 So.2d 196, 202 (Miss.2002). Consequently, NBCI has no duty to defend since intentional acts, even when negligent, are not accidents under the policy language (Moulton, 464 So.2d 507, 509 (Miss.1985)). 

Given the intentional nature of the trespass, the district court’s summary judgment in favor of NBCI is affirmed. NBCI does not owe a duty to defend or indemnify Slocum in this case.
