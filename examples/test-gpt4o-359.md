VI.
Finally, we address the procedural aspect of the case concerning the transferee court's application of law. In reference to Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 639 (1964), the transferee court must apply the law of the state where the suit was originally filed, including that state's choice-of-law rules. This principle was reaffirmed in Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 243 (1981). Therefore, the law that governs is the law of the state where the policy was initially made, which in this case necessitates the application of Michigan law as per the rationale in reference case 141 F.3d 612 concerning the interpretation of contracts.

Further, according to the ruling in Ferens v. John Deere Co., 494 U.S. 516, 523 (1990), if a plaintiff moves for a transfer under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), the transferee court should apply the same choice-of-law rules as the transferor court. The district court, in initially applying Virginia law, erred in ignoring this requisite approach.

For these reasons, the district court's application of law under the declaratory judgment action is reversed, and the case is remanded for proper proceedings in line with Michigan law as required by these precedents.

gold_text: . The district court found that Michigan’s choice-of-law principles apply to this case. But because this case was transferred on convenience grounds, 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), there is good reason to question that determination. See Northland Ins. Co. v. Guardsman Prods., 141 F.3d 612, 616 (6th Cir.1998) (noting that when a diversity case is transferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), the "transferee court must apply the law of the state where the suit was originally filed, including that state’s choice of law rules”) (quoting Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 639, 84 S.Ct. 805, 11 L.Ed.2d 945 (1964)); see also Ferens v. John Deere Co., 494 U.S. 516, 519, 110 S.Ct. 1274, 108 L.Ed.2d 443 (1990). Nevertheless, the parties have applied Michigan’s choice-of-law principles.
