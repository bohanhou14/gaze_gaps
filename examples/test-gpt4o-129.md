This case demonstrates the discretionary power of federal courts in exercising jurisdiction, particularly relevant when other concurrent jurisdictions like state courts are involved. It aligns with the principle established in **285 U.S. 413**, emphasizing that courts may decline jurisdiction if litigation can be more appropriately conducted in another tribunal, especially when it involves foreign or non-resident parties. This discretion is also illustrated in **103 F.2d 613**, which discusses a court’s duty to exercise jurisdiction but acknowledges that this is not absolute, especially when another remedy is available. The use of declaratory relief, as a discretionary power, should not result in piecemeal litigation and should respect concurrent jurisdiction principles.

Moreover, the procedural complexities and potential for jurisdictional overlap call to mind the **102 F.2d 288** case, where the existence of an "actual controversy" was crucial for maintaining federal jurisdiction. Here, the absence of a bona fide controversy between the plaintiff and insured, as seen via realignment principles, prevents federal jurisdiction. The District Judge's discretion not to exercise declaratory relief in favor of maintaining state jurisdiction aligns with previously established judicial principles, reiterating the judicial preference for non-interference when adequate remedies are available in state courts.

This case affirms that federal courts are judicious in exercising discretionary jurisdiction, especially to avoid redundant litigation and uphold the comity between state and federal judicial systems.
