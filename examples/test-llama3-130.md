In the context of patent law, the enablement requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112 states that a patent specification must provide a written description of the invention and its manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. The Supreme Court has emphasized that enablement is a question of law, and the burden is on the patent applicant to establish that the specification is enabling.

In the case of 802 F.2d 1367, the court held that an applicant's claim for a process of making a live, non-pathogenic vaccine against a pathogenic RNA virus was not enabled because the specification only provided a single working example of a vaccine against a particular strain of avian RNA virus, and the applicant failed to establish that the success of this example could be extrapolated to other strains of RNA viruses.

Similarly, in the case of 559 F.2d 595, the court rejected a claim for a process of producing a live, non-pathogenic vaccine against a pathogenic RNA virus, citing the lack of enablement in the specification. The court noted that the specification did not provide sufficient guidance for one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention without undue experimentation.

In the present case, the examiner and the board correctly pointed out that the specification of Wright's application did not provide sufficient enablement for the appealed claims. The specification only provided a general description of the invention and a single working example of a vaccine against a particular strain of avian RNA virus, and failed to establish that the success of this example could be extrapolated to other strains of RNA viruses. The board's decision to sustain the examiner's rejection is therefore affirmed.

gold_text: . In his appeal to this court, Wright all too frequently slips into using the present tense to discuss the state of the art and what a skilled artisan would believe given Wright’s success with one avian virus. We note, however, that the issue is not what the state of the art is today or what a skilled artisan today would believe, but rather what the state of the art was in February of 1983 and what a skilled artisan would have believed at that time. Hybritech Inc. v. Monoclonal Antibodies, Inc., 802 F.2d 1367, 1384, 231 USPQ 81, 94 (Fed.Cir.), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 947, 107 S.Ct. 1606, 94 L.Ed.2d 792 (1987); In re Hogan, 559 F.2d 595, 604, 194 USPQ 527, 535 (CCPA 1977). Wright's tendency to employ the present tense often makes it difficult to determine whether Wright is asserting that certain information was known prior to February of 1983 or simply that that information is now known in the art.
