The School Board's authority to discipline Aaron for his off-campus speech is supported by the principles discussed in 420 U.S. 308, where the Court noted the necessity for school officials to act promptly in reliance on information that might subsequently be determined as factually insufficient. Additionally, the importance of qualified immunity for officials making such decisions (420 U.S. 308) ensures they are not unduly burdened by judgments made in good faith to maintain order.

Furthermore, the Court's reasoning in 490 U.S. 386 underscores that the assessment of the reasonableness of the School Board's actions should be an objective inquiry. The decision to suspend Aaron was objectively reasonable given the circumstances and the potential for substantial disruption. Just as in 490 U.S. 386, where officers' actions in high-pressure situations must be judged on their objective reasonableness, the School Board's measures must be evaluated based on the real and foreseeable consequences of Aaron’s conduct.

Thus, the District Court's affirmation rests on a solid legal foundation that respects both the need for prompt, decisive action by school officials and the objective standard of reasonableness in addressing potentially threatening student behavior.

gold_text: Whether these aspects of reasonable foreseeability are considered issues of law or issues of fact as to which, on this record, no reasonable jury could disagree, foreseeability of both communication to school authorities, including the teacher, and the risk of substantial disruption is not only reasonable, but clear. These consequences permit school discipline, whether or not Aaron intended his IM icon to be communicated to school authorities or, if communicated, to cause a substantial disruption. As in Morse, the student in the pending case was not disciplined for conduct that was merely “offensive,” Morse, — U.S. at —, 127 S.Ct. at 2629, or merely in conflict with some view of the school’s “educational mission,” id. at 2637 (Alito, J., with whom Kennedy, J., joins, concurring). Although the Appellants contend that the First Amendment barred the imposition of any discipline, they make no distinct challenge to the extent of the discipline. Thus, we need not determine whether such a challenge would have to be grounded on the First Amendment itself or the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Cf. Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (“Because the Fourth Amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against this sort of physically intrusive governmental conduct, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of ‘substantive due process,’ must be the guide for analyzing these claims.”). And we are mindful that “[i]t is not the role of the federal courts to set aside decisions of school administrators which the court may view as lacking a basis in wisdom or compassion.” Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 326, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975). However, in the absence of a properly presented challenge, we do not decide whether the length of the one semester suspension exceeded whatever constitutional limitation might exist. We rule only that the First Amendment claims against the School Board and the Superintendent were properly dismissed, and that the state law claims were properly left for whatever state court adjudication might be available. We need not rule on the Superintendent’s defense of qualified immunity.
