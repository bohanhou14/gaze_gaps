Based on the provided references, the case at hand involves Charles Crawley, who was convicted of voter fraud and embezzlement. Crawley appeals his conviction and sentence, arguing that the district court erred in admitting evidence of his 1999 voter fraud, utilizing his salary and pension as a measure of "dollar loss" under the advisory Guidelines, and ordering restitution.

Regarding the admission of evidence, Crawley argues that the district court violated Rule 404(b) by permitting the Government to present proof regarding his participation in the 1999 voter fraud. However, the court held that the extrinsic evidence was offered to demonstrate Crawley acted with the same specific intent in 2002 as he had in 1999, and the district court gave a limiting instruction to the jury. This finding is plausible in the light of the entire record, and the court did not err in admitting the evidence.

In calculating the "dollar loss" under the advisory Guidelines, the district court used Crawley's entire salary and pension as intended loss. Crawley argues that this was error, citing United States v. Burns, 104 F.3d 529 (2d Cir.1997), which held that any dollar loss for the period utilized must be reduced by the amount of services he legitimately rendered. However, the court in Burns acknowledged that the district court could have plausibly regarded all of defendant's salary as a loss, and the court in this case logically determined that it was appropriate to include Crawley's entire salary and pension in its loss calculation, given that his position as president had been procured by fraud.

Finally, Crawley challenges his restitution award, arguing that it was based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. However, the court's finding that intended loss equals Crawley's salary and pension was not clearly erroneous, and the restitution award is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Therefore, Crawley's challenges to his conviction and sentence are without merit. References: 496 F.3d 371, 411 F.3d 591.

gold_text: Crawley contests the restitution of $121,478.86 (salary and pension from 2003 and the $20,000 kickback) because he claims that amount was not actually lost by Local 988. Under the Mandatory Victim Restoration Act (MVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, “[a] defendant ... is only responsible for paying restitution for the conduct underlying the offense for which he was convicted”. United States v. Wright, 496 F.3d 371, 381-82 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Inman, 411 F.3d 591, 595 (5th Cir.2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). When, as here, a fraudulent scheme is an element of the conviction, the court may award restitution for “actions pursuant to that scheme”, with the restitution for the underlying scheme to defraud being limited to the specific temporal scope of the indictment.
