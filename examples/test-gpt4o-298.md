**Generation:**

Shively and Pardee's defenses were not only antagonistic but mutually exclusive, akin to the situation in United States v. Johnson, 478 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir.1973) and further elucidated in United States v. Wilson, 500 F.2d 715 (5th Cir. 1974). In those cases, it was held that defenses which are irreconcilable and mutually antagonistic to the extent that each defendant implicates the other create a compelling prejudice that necessitates severance (581 F.2d 489). Here, Shively's defense was essentially, "Pardee did it," while Pardee claimed he acted under Shively’s assurances, creating a scenario where each defendant served as the other's prosecutor, thereby denying both a fair trial (690 F.2d 1289). Under such conditions, severance should have been granted to avoid severe prejudice and ensure a fair trial for each defendant.

gold_text: But Shively also casts his argument for severance in a more conventional form by appealing to a line of cases which hold that if codefendants have inconsistent defenses severance must be granted if — but only if — the defenses “conflict to the point of being irreconcilable and mutually exclusive.” United States v. Crawford, 581 F.2d 489, 491 (5th Cir.1978). See, e.g., United States v. Kopituk, 690 F.2d 1289, 1316 (11th Cir.1982). The danger is that in a case of irreconcilable and mutually exclusive defenses the jury is quite likely to convict at least one of the defendants without carefully weighing the evidence of his guilt. This is not such a case. The principal discrepancy between the two defendants’ stories was that Pardee testified that Shively had assured him that the loan was authorized even though the proceeds were intended for Pardee; this falls short of the type of conflict of which cases like Crawford and Kopituk speak. At all events, we do not think that Shively was made appreciably worse off by being tried with Pardee. Pardee made a rather appealing defendant since he had not profited personally from the various crimes that were charged and some of the jury’s expected sympathy for him might have lapped over to Shively. More important, Shively’s story which Pardee contradicted — that the loan was a bona fide loan for Pardee’s business needs, unrelated to Pardee’s personal loan to him — was incredible, and would not have been believed even if Pardee had not testified.
