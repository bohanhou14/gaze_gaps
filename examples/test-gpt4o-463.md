In FOIA cases, agencies sometimes invoke a Glomar response, neither confirming nor denying the existence of records when doing so would reveal protected information. This principle emerged from Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009 (D.C. Cir. 1976), surrounding a request for records on the "Glo-mar Explorer." The courts have upheld Glomar responses to protect against unwarranted invasions of privacy under Exemption 7(C), especially when requests involve confidential informants or sensitive law enforcement details.

In the context of the FOIA requests for information about Ishmael "Chuku" Brathwaite and Alvin "Tatoo" Hodge to agencies like the FBI, DEA, and EOUSA, Glomar responses were issued. As argued by the agencies, confirming or denying the existence of records related to these individuals could inadvertently disclose their status as informants, thus exposing them to danger or harassment. The FBI and DEA, citing privacy concerns, refused to process the requests in line with the legal precedent that supports the importance of protecting personal privacy through Glomar responses (71 F.3d 885, 546 F.2d 1009).

Accordingly, the Court finds that the agencies appropriately applied Glomar responses to FOIA requests regarding Brathwaite and Hodge. This decision aligns with the need to shield sensitive information and individuals involved in law enforcement activities, as established in Phillippi and related cases.

In conclusion, the Glomar responses issued by the agencies in this case are justified under Exemption 7(C), ensuring both compliance with legal standards and the protection of individual privacy.

gold_text: If an individual is the target of a FOIA request, the agency to which the FOIA request is submitted may provide a “Glomar” response: the agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records or information responsive to the request on the ground that even acknowledging the existence of responsive records constitutes an unwarranted invasion of the targeted individual’s personal privacy. See Nation Magazine v. United States Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885, 893 (D.C.Cir. 1995); Phillippi v. Central Intelligence Agency, 546 F.2d 1009, 1014-15 (D.C.Cir. 1976). Citing such privacy concerns, the FBIHQ, EOUSA and DEA neither confirmed nor denied the existence of records pertaining to Mr. Brathwaite and Mr. Hodge on the ground that their disclosure without the subjects’ written authorization could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of their personal privacy.
