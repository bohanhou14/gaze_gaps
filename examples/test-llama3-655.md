The reference cases provided have shed light on the legal framework surrounding the anti-trust laws and the statute of limitations. In case 273 U.S. 359, the court ruled that the venue of a civil action in a federal court in one district can be fixed by the discretion of the court, and the process can be issued to another district where the defendant resides or is found. This case sets the precedent for the jurisdictional defenses in this case.

In case 234 U.S. 579, the court discussed the application of the statute of limitations in anti-trust cases. The court held that the local law applies to the statute of limitations, and in this case, the two-year period of limitations must be applied. The court also noted that the treble damages provision in the Clayton Act defines a new liability, and the statutory liability is not a codification of a common law right.

In the present case, the court must determine whether the defendants' refusal to sell their goods to the plaintiff at dealers' discounts was in furtherance of a purpose to monopolize and constituted an actionable wrong. The court must also consider whether the statute of limitations bars the claim. The court's ruling will be guided by the principles set forth in the reference cases, particularly with regard to the application of the statute of limitations.

In conclusion, the reference cases provide important guidance for the legal analysis of this case. The court must carefully consider the jurisdictional defenses and the application of the statute of limitations in determining the outcome of this case.

gold_text: As a matter of fact, within the meaning of the Clayton Act, the-Illinois corporation was transacting business in the State of Montana during all the period complained of and up to the filing of the complaint herein. Though the West Virginia corporation operated the branch houses, they were, as I have stated, nevertheless subject to the supervision of division managers employed by the Illinois corporation; the Illinois corporation employed car route salesmen who solicited business in certain areas in the eastern part of Montana throughout the period complained of and as late as the middle of 1934. These salesmen were empowered not only to solicit orders but to execute contracts of sale. It was not necessary for them to obtain the confirmation of such sales by any officer or official of the home office. In addition they made collections of payments due from the customers of the Illinois corporation with whom they were doing business. Such activities clearly constituted business transacted within the State of Montana, Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Co., 273 U.S. 359, 47 S.Ct. 400, 71 L.Ed. 684. During the entire period it was entirely possible, under the provisions of the Clayton Act, to bring suit not only in the judicial district of which it was an inhabitant but also in any district where it could have been found or transacted business, and all process in such cases may be served in the district of which the corporation is an inhabitant or wherever it may be found.
