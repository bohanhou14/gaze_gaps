The case at hand involves a petition for a contempt adjudication against the defendant for violating a final decree in an action. The decree prohibited the defendant from advertising, offering for sale, or selling plaintiff's products at prices less than the minimum prices established by plaintiff's fair trade agreements. The defendant is accused of using Masters Mail Order House, a separate corporation, to evade the decree by selling plaintiff's products to New York residents at cut prices.

In considering the defendant's contention that the injunction decree does not apply to its interstate transactions, the court notes that the MacGuire Act, which altered the Wentling rule, was in full force and effect by the time of the alleged violations. The court also cites the case of General Electric Company v. Masters, Inc., which held that the injunction decree could not be interpreted to exclude defendant's interstate transactions.

The court finds that the central issue is whether Masters Mail Order House was organized and used by the defendant to evade the decree, and if so, whether the defendant's activities in New York in connection with the sale and advertising of plaintiff's products from the Washington store were and are being utilized to achieve an illegal objective. The court concludes that the application cannot be decided on the papers submitted and orders a full hearing, with the appointment of a special master to explore the issues.

The court's decision is guided by the principles outlined in cases such as Krentler-Arnold Hinge Last Company v. Peterson, 284 U.S. 448, which emphasized the importance of enforcing injunctive decrees to maintain the authority of the court and do equity toward those in whose favor a decree has been rendered. The court also considers the rulings in cases such as Dadirrian v. Gullian, 182 F.2d 604, and Harvey v. Bettis, 9 Cir, 35 F.2d 349, which addressed the issue of contempt and the importance of considering the intent and purpose behind an act.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of enforcing injunctive decrees and the need to consider the intent and purpose behind an act in determining whether a contempt has been committed. The court's reliance on cases such as Krentler-Arnold Hinge Last Company v. Peterson and General Electric Company v. Masters, Inc. demonstrates its commitment to upholding the authority of the court and doing equity toward those in whose favor a decree has been rendered. <
