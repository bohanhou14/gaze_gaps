In the case of Haynsworth v. United States, the court was faced with the issue of whether a defendant who had been convicted of a felony in violation of his right to counsel could deny ever having been convicted in order to obtain a firearm. The court held that the defendant's prior felony convictions were sufficient evidence to support the conviction, even though the convictions were obtained in violation of the right to counsel.

The court relied on the decisions in United States v. Lufman, 488 F.2d 724, and United States v. DuShane, 435 F.2d 187, which held that a conviction obtained in violation of the right to counsel could not be used to support a conviction or enhance punishment under a recidivist statute. However, the court distinguished these cases and held that the prior felony convictions were sufficient evidence to support the conviction in this case.

The court also relied on the decision in United States v. Cody, 529 F.2d 564, which held that a conviction obtained in violation of the right to counsel could not be used to support a conviction or enhance punishment under a recidivist statute. However, the court distinguished this case and held that the prior felony convictions were sufficient evidence to support the conviction in this case.

In conclusion, the court held that a defendant who had been convicted of a felony in violation of his right to counsel could deny ever having been convicted in order to obtain a firearm, but only if the defendant had received a full pardon or had successfully attacked his prior conviction in court.
