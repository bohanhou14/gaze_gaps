In evaluating Burress's subjective complaints of pain and syncope symptoms, the ALJ must adhere to the standards set forth in Polaski v. Heckler, 739 F.2d 1320, 1322 (8th Cir.1984), as cited in the reference case 133 F.3d 583. This requires considering factors such as Burress's daily activities, the intensity and frequency of her symptoms, medication effects, and any inconsistencies in her testimony. The ALJ discredited Burress’s complaints without adequately addressing these factors or detailing the inconsistencies, which is required for a proper credibility determination.

Furthermore, in accordance with reference case 739 F.2d 1320, the absence of objective medical evidence supporting the degree of severity claimed by Burress should not be the sole factor in evaluating her credibility. The ALJ failed to give full consideration to all the evidence, including observations from Burress's treating physicians who described her condition as "very symptomatic."

Given these shortcomings, the record does not reflect substantial evidence needed to uphold the ALJ’s decision, as substantial evidence on the record as a whole includes evaluating and balancing all relevant evidence. Therefore, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with these legal standards.

gold_text: In addition to the medical evidence, the ALJ also considered, and largely discredited, Burress’s testimony regarding her subjective limitations. Applying the considerations set forth in Polaski v. Heckler, 739 F.2d 1320, 1322 (8th Cir.1984), cert. granted and judgment vacated on other grounds by Bowen v. Polaski, 476 U.S. 1167, 106 S.Ct. 2885, 90 L.Ed.2d 974 (1986), the ALJ determined that Burress’s limitations were less severe than she claimed. Although an ALJ may reject aclaimant’s subjective allegations of pain and limitation, in doing so the ALJ “must make an express credibility determination detailing the reasons for discrediting the testimony, must set forth the inconsistencies, and must discuss the Polaski factors.” Kelley v. Callahan, 133 F.3d 583, 588 (8th Cir.1998).
