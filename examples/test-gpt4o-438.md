First, FNBEA contends that under the VISA Member-Merchant Agreement, it essentially stepped into the shoes of the credit card holders, thereby becoming an assignee of their claims. FNBEA cites that the agreement's terms demonstrate such an assignment and thus seeks priority status that an assignee should receive. 

Second, FNBEA argues that its role is akin to that of Brooks in the referenced cases (667 F.2d 1244, 667 F.2d 1244), where the court treated the party as an assignee, not a subrogee, thereby allowing priority treatment. FNBEA emphasizes that like Brooks, which was allowed priority treatment under § 507(a)(3) due to the assignment, it too should not be precluded from priority under § 507(d).

In contrast, the debtor draws attention to the legal principles clarified in cases such as In re P.J. Nee Co., 36 B.R. 609 (Bankr. D. Md. 1983), where similar contexts were treated under subrogation. The debtor insists that FNBEA's position is fundamentally one of subrogation, where FNBEA reimbursed the credit card holders and pursued the claims as a subrogee, thus falling squarely within 11 U.S.C. § 507(d) that denies priority for subrogees.

Given these perspectives, the final determination underlines a nuanced interpretation of the agreements and the Bankruptcy Code provisions, informed by case precedents like those under 667 F.2d 1244, distinguishing between the capacities of assignee versus subrogee.

gold_text: First, FNBEA argues that it is an assign-ee pursuant to the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in the case of Wilson v. Brooks Supermarket, Inc. (In re Missionary Baptist Found. of America, Inc.), 667 F.2d 1244, 1246 (5th Cir.1982). The Fifth Circuit case involved a claimant who voluntarily cashed payroll checks for employees of a debtor without any liability to do so. The court found that the claimant was not a subrogee, but an assignee of the employees and, therefore, 11 U.S.C. § 507(d) did not bar the claim of priority. Wilson v. Brooks Supermarket, Inc. (In re Missionary Baptist Foundation of America, Inc.), 667 F.2d 1244 (5th Cir.1982), citing In re Stultz Bros., 226 F. 989 (S.D.N.Y.1915). The facts in the instant case are distinguishable because FNBEA did not act voluntarily when it “reversed” the credit card holders’ charges, but was required by law to credit the accounts in the amounts of the disputed claims. Since FNBEA’s actions were required by law, its claim arises from subrogation rather than assignment.
