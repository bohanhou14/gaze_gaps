**Generation:**

Plaintiff contends that defendants' actions constitute unfair competition, alleging that the sale of the professional “Satin-Set” hair spray misleadingly suggests it is suitable for consumer use, damaging the plaintiff's reputation and goodwill. As in Cheney Bros. v. Gimbel Bros., 280 F. 746, where misrepresentations about product quality justified injunctive relief, plaintiffs argue that defendants' sale of the professional product as a consumer item similarly misrepresents its suitability, leading to public deception and potential injury. 

Furthermore, plaintiff emphasizes that under established unfair competition principles, actual deception or specific loss of sales need not be demonstrated. As recognized in 162 F.2d 893, the mere potential for public deception suffices for asserting unfair competition claims. The packaging similarities and extensive advertisement of both “Satin-Set” products enhance the likelihood of confusion, underscoring the need for preventive measures to protect the plaintiff's reputation. Consequently, plaintiff seeks injunctive relief based on the probable risk of public deception and resultant harm to its brand equity.

gold_text: The defendants have relied on a host of cases to sustain their position that the plaintiff must show actual public deception and specific loss of trade in order to be entitled to injunctive relief, but this Court concludes that none of these decisions govern the instant case and that only the cases of United-Detroit Theaters Corp. v. Colonial Theatrical Enterprise, Inc., 280 Mich. 425, 273 N. W. 756; American Washboard Co. v. Saginaw Mfg. Co. (C.C.A.6), 103 F. 281, 50 L.R.A. 609; and California Apparel Creators v. Wieder (C.A.2), 162 F.2d 893, 174 A.L.R. 481, merit any discussion.
