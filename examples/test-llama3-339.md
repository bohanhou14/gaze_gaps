The jurisdictional issue at hand is complex, with multiple courts involved. The SEC issued a subpoena to Bank of the West, a disinterested third-party custodian of records, for all records related to Gewerter's client trust account. The subpoena was issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, while the records are maintained in Nevada. Gewerter, a Nevada attorney, filed a motion to quash the subpoena in the Nevada district court, arguing that the subpoena was overly broad, oppressive, and unduly burdensome.

The Nevada district court denied Gewerter's motion to quash without prejudice, concluding that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(c)(3), it had no authority to quash a subpoena that was issued by a court in another district. Gewerter appeals, citing cases such as 949 F.2d 228 and 141 F.3d 337.

In 949 F.2d 228, the court held that a nonparty deponent's motion for a protective order pending action by the trial court, and deferring to the trial court's resolution of that motion, may well allow similar abstention on a motion to quash, followed by deference to the trial court's decision on a motion for a protective order. Similarly, in 141 F.3d 337, the court explained that the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 26(c) recognizes the power of the court in the district where a deposition is being taken to make protective orders.

In this case, Gewerter's motion to quash the subpoena should have been adjudicated by the California district court, which issued the subpoena. The California district court's decision should be deferred to, as it is the only court with the power to order enforcement. We therefore affirm the Nevada district court's denial of Gewerter's motion to quash.

gold_text: On the basis of the clear language of Rule 45, we must hold that the court that issued the subpoena, and not the court where the underlying action is pending, can entertain a motion to quash or modify a subpoena. Our holding is consistent with the decisions of two other Circuits that have decided this issue. See In re Digital Equip. Corp., 949 F.2d 228 (8th Cir.1991) (holding that the South Dakota district court, where the underlying action was pending, did not have jurisdiction to rule on the objections to a subpoena issued by the Oregon district court); In re Sealed Case, 141 F.3d 337, 341 (D.C.Cir.1998) (noting that “[sjubpoenas are process of the issuing court, ... and nothing in the Rules even hints that any other court may be given the power to quash or enforce them” (citations omitted)).
