The issue of summary judgment is crucial in determining whether a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In this case, both the plaintiff and defendant have filed motions for summary judgment. To determine whether summary judgment is appropriate, the court must consider whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

In the case of Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986), the Supreme Court held that a party seeking summary judgment must demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.

In this case, the plaintiff has presented evidence that it is the owner of Notes 1 and 2, and that it has complied with Louisiana Revised Statutes 13:3740 and 13:3741. The defendant has not presented any evidence to dispute these facts. Therefore, the court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

In the case of Beck v. Somerset Technologies, Inc., 969 F.2d 1559 (5th Cir. 1992), the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a party seeking summary judgment must produce evidence that negates the existence of a material element in the non-moving party's claim or defense. The court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.

In this case, the defendant has not presented any evidence to dispute the plaintiff's ownership of Notes 1 and 2, or its compliance with Louisiana Revised Statutes 13:3740 and 13:3741. Therefore, the court finds that the defendant has failed to produce evidence that negates the existence of a material element in the plaintiff's claim.

Based on the evidence and the law, the court finds that summary judgment is appropriate in this case. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issues of its ownership of Notes 1 and 2, and its compliance with Louisiana Revised Statutes 13:3740 and 13:3741.

Therefore, IT IS ORDERED that the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted. The defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a
