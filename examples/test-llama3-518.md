The case at hand involves a claim of substantive and procedural due-process violations against David Arnold, the Interim Executive Director of the Mahoning County Children’s Services Board. The plaintiff, Engler, alleges that Arnold failed to investigate or report allegations of child abuse, which increased the risk of harm to the child, T.F.

To establish a claim under the state-created-danger theory, Engler must show that Arnold's affirmative acts created or increased the risk of harm to T.F. However, the complaint fails to provide sufficient factual matter to support this claim. The court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accept all factual allegations as true, but the allegations must contain sufficient factual content to allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that Arnold is liable for the misconduct alleged.

In DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 197, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989), the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause does not impose on the state an affirmative duty to protect individuals against private acts of violence. The court also recognized two exceptions to this general rule: a duty to protect may arise when an individual is placed in the custody of the state, and a state-created-danger theory, where state actors may be held liable if their affirmative acts create or increase the risk of harm.

However, the complaint fails to provide sufficient facts to support the state-created-danger theory. The court cannot draw the reasonable inference that Arnold's affirmative acts created or increased the risk of harm to T.F. because the complaint lacks sufficient factual content. The court must also consider that a state official's failure to investigate or report allegations of child abuse does not constitute an affirmative act, as held in Langdon v. Skelding, 524 Fed.Appx. 172, 176 (6th Cir. 2013).

In conclusion, the complaint fails to state a claim for substantive and procedural due-process violations against Arnold. The court affirms the district court's dismissal of this claim, citing McPherson v. Kelsey, 125 F.3d 989, 995-96 (6th Cir. 1997), and Citizens Awareness Network, Inc. v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 59 F.3d 284, 293-94 (1st Cir
