In determining the district court's award of prejudgment interest, we align with the guidelines established in General Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp., 461 U.S. 648. The statute at hand, 35 U.S.C. ยง 284, stipulates that interest shall be "fixed by the court," thus granting the court discretion in awarding prejudgment interest (461 U.S. at 656-57). Our review focuses on whether the district court abused its discretion in this regard (862 F.2d 267).

The district court awarded Oiness prejudgment interest at the Colorado statutory rate of 8%, despite Oiness's request for a higher rate of 16.52%. The Supreme Court has emphasized that prejudgment interest should typically be awarded to ensure full compensation for the patent owner (807 F.2d 964). However, it is within the court's purview to limit or deny interest based on equitable considerations, such as undue delay by the patentee (717 F.2d 1380).

The district court provided justified reasons for its decisions, including considerations of the statutory guidelines and equitable factors. Given the established jurisprudence and the evidence presented, there is no indication that the district court abused its discretion in setting the interest rate. Therefore, this court affirms the district court's decision on prejudgment interest.
