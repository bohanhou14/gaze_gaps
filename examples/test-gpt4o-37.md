Statutory Construction of 25 U.S.C. § 1631(b)(1)

In determining whether the IHS's action complies with the statutory conditions imposed by 25 U.S.C. § 1631(b)(1), we must consider the principles of statutory interpretation, particularly those applicable to Indian law. It is a well-established canon that statutes concerning Indian tribes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians, and ambiguous provisions are to be interpreted to their benefit (Reference case 411 U.S. 164, 174). Furthermore, the unique trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes mandates this approach (Reference case 470 U.S. 226, 247).

Applying these principles, the discontinuation of inpatient services without proper consultation with the tribe and failure to meet the contingencies set forth in the PJD, such as ensuring the Wagner Community Memorial Hospital’s JCAHO accreditation and Indian representation on its board, violates the statutory requirements. The Wagner facility's services were reduced without satisfying the necessary procedural safeguards, contradicting the intended statutory protection.

As noted in Reference case 471 U.S. 759, the consent of the affected tribe is paramount and must be clearly manifested before any action adversely affecting the tribe's interests is taken. The absence of individual notice and hearings further underscores the non-compliance with § 1631(b)(1) and the related statutory and regulatory obligations.

Thus, given the statutory and judicial precedents, the actions of the IHS in phasing out inpatient and emergency services at the Wagner IHS Health Care Facility, without adhering to mandated consultative procedures and tribal protections, cannot stand.
