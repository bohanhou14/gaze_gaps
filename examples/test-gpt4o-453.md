Lindquist asserts that the district court’s reliance on his prior convictions without requiring jury determination violated the Sixth Amendment. However, as established in United States v. Yahnke, facts presented in the PSR are deemed admitted unless the defendant objects (411 F.3d 906). Additionally, Johnson confirms that the Sixth Amendment does not mandate that a jury determine the fact of a prior conviction (411 F.3d 928). Further, in Marcussen, it was upheld that the characterization of these convictions as crimes of violence is a legal matter for the court (403 F.3d 982).

Therefore, Lindquist’s contention that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment fails. The district court appropriately included his prior convictions in its calculations without expanding jury determinations beyond what the amendment requires. Accordingly, we affirm this aspect of Lindquist’s sentence.

gold_text: . Lindquist also argues that the district court violated the Sixth Amendment when it found facts necessary to categorize § 714.7 as a crime of violence. We have consistently rejected the applicability of Booker to the fact of a prior conviction, see, e.g., United States v. Paz, 411 F.3d 906, 909 (8th Cir.2005), and to the legal determination of whether a prior conviction may be categorized as a crime of violence, see, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 411 F.3d 928, 931-32 (8th Cir.2005). Indeed, in both Booker and Shepard v. United States, - U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the ability of the sentencing court to take notice of a defendant’s criminal history and, as a matter of law, determine whether any prior conviction is properly categorized as a crime of violence. See United States v. Marcussen, 403 F.3d 982, 984 (8th Cir.2005).
