Based on the provided reference cases, the court's action in imposing sanctions on the attorney, James M. Smith, is justified. In the case of 501 U.S. 32, the court held that the attorney's conduct was sanctionable, and the fact that the attorney refused to be deterred did not render the court's action an abuse of discretion.

Similarly, in the case of 197 F.R.D. 212, the court imposed sanctions on the attorney for failing to comply with court orders and for causing unnecessary delay in the trial date. The court's discretion in imposing sanctions was not abused, and the sanctions were tailored to the particular wrong committed by the attorney.

In this case, Smith failed to prepare and submit a timely proposed pre-trial order, which compromised the court's ability to manage its docket and shepherd the case to trial. This failure was not substantially justified and was not harmless. The court's imposition of sanctions on Smith is therefore justified, and the sanctions are tailored to the particular wrong committed by the attorney.

The court's discretion in imposing sanctions is not abused, and the sanctions are reasonable given the circumstances. The court's goal is to ensure that attorneys comply with court orders and to prevent unnecessary delay in the trial date. The imposition of sanctions on Smith achieves this goal and is therefore justified.
