The issue at hand is whether the preliminary injunction should be granted to preserve the status quo ante litem. In Reference case 747 F.2d 511, the court held that the function of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo ante litem, pending a determination of the action on the merits. (Tanner Motor Livery, Ltd. v. Avis, Inc., 316 F.2d 804, 809 (9th Cir.1963). In this case, the status quo ante litem is that SFI's Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of poison pill warrants to protect the Company's shareholders from unfair or coercive takeovers.

The plaintiff argues that the issuance of the warrants is a breach of the fiduciary duty of the directors to act in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. However, the court has held that the business judgment rule is applicable in this case, as the directors acted in good faith and exercised due care in ascertaining the relevant facts and law before acting. (Whittaker Corp. v. Edgar, 535 F.Supp. 933, 950 (N.D.Ill.1982). The directors' decision to issue the warrants was made after careful consideration and advice from investment bankers and law firms.

In conclusion, the preliminary injunction should not be granted as it would disrupt the status quo ante litem and interfere with the Company's ability to protect its shareholders from unfair or coercive takeovers. The business judgment rule is applicable in this case, and the directors' decision to issue the warrants was made in good faith and exercised due care. (Reference case 747 F.2d 511, 316 F.2d 804)
