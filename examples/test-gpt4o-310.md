The exclusion of evidence is a pivotal issue in this appeal. In addressing the defendants' claim that their right to present a full defense was compromised by the district court's refusal to admit expert testimony, it is critical to consider the application of Rule 403 and other relevant precedents. In the reference case 878 F.2d 608, it was established that evidence admissible under one purpose, such as explaining lawful tax practices, could still be excluded if it posed a risk of unfair prejudice or confusing the jury. Similarly, the U.S. Supreme Court in 475 U.S. 673 has emphasized that a fair trial does not guarantee the admission of all proffered evidence, particularly where the evidence might distract the jury from the central issues of the case.

Moreover, in 543 F.2d 1042, it was held that intermediary transactions or explanations that significantly diverge from the core claims and defenses might not only confuse but also dilute the factual determinations required for a just verdict. Here, such exclusions are aimed at preventing the jury from being misled by peripheral issues.

Applying these principles, the trial court's decision falls within its discretion, as the potentially confusing nature of long-defunct tax rules regarding foreign trusts might overshadow the relevant facts of the conspiracy to defraud the IRS. Thus, the exclusion of Palmer’s testimony does not constitute reversible error.

gold_text: We see no basis to disturb the district court’s ruling on the proffered testimony of the defense expert. The proffer was made after the testimony of Quirini, Morrison and Mrs. Fletcher but before that of Fletcher. At the time of the proffer, there was no testimony as to any foreign corporations and Quirini, Morrison and Mrs. Fletcher had testified that no money had been placed in trust accounts. Later, while Fletcher testified that the use of foreign corporations and trusts had been discussed by the conspirators and that, in substance, such use had lawful tax advantages, he testified that he did not have a trust account or own a corporation in the Bahamas. In view of this testimony, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding largely irrelevant evidence as to foreign trust tax effects in the United States that ceased to exist four years prior to the time of the acts alleged in the indictment and as to foreign corporation tax consequences which were not at issue in this case. The district court was not “manifestly erroneous” in excluding the proffered testimony as irrelevant under Fed.R.Evid. 401, United States v. Diaz, 878 F.2d 608, 616 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 110 S.Ct. 543, 107 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989); United States v. Kraeger, 711 F.2d 6, 7-8 (2d Cir.1983), especially because explaining the tax law is generally within the purview of the court, not expert witnesses. See, e.g., Kraeger, 711 F.2d at 7-8. Nor did the district court compromise the fifth amendment’s guarantee of due process. See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1436, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986); United States v. Corr, 543 F.2d 1042, 1051 (2d Cir.1976). The district court also did not err in excluding the expert evidence pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 702. The most such evidence could have done would have been to lend credence to Fletcher’s claim, fully presented to the jury, that when foreign trusts and foreign corporations owned by United States citizens were discussed, he believed there were lawful tax advantages to such vehicles. But this marginal assistance to Fletcher would likely have contributed to jury confusion, not enlightenment, in view of Fletcher’s testimony that he did not have a trust account or own a corporation in the Bahamas. Rule 702 predicates the admissibility of expert testimony on its assisting the jury. The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the Palmer testimony in this case.
