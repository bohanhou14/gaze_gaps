Montgomery also asserts that Officers Owens, Ropp, and Crippen acted with deliberate indifference by failing to promptly enter her home to provide assistance. Like the district court, we find this argument unpersuasive. 

The Due Process Clause does not apply to a State’s failure to protect an individual from private acts of violence unless specific conditions are met, such as the State creating the danger or having custody over the individual (362 F.3d 1089). In the present case, the police department’s perimeter establishment and wait for the emergency response team reflect a policy aimed at securing the safety of both officers and civilians in potentially volatile situations. Such procedures, based on known risks, do not meet the standard for deliberate indifference as the officers acted within the scope of regular police protocols, analogous to the reasoning in 905 F.2d 1386, which held that police actions in response to reported violence do not inherently impose a special duty of protection.

Furthermore, mere failure to act immediately does not constitute a constitutional violation unless the delay is proven to be conscience-shocking and extremely unreasonable (235 F.3d 275). Here, the officers’ cautious approach under uncertain conditions about Bailey’s status and location, drawing reasonable inferences in their favor, does not shock the conscience. Thus, the claim against Officers Owens, Ropp, and Crippen lacks substantive merit.

Therefore, we hold that summary judgment in favor of the City Defendants was appropriate, reaffirming the absence of any law-breaking conduct on their part.

gold_text: We also affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment for Officers Owens, Ropp, and Crippen. Montgomery’s complaint against these defendants is that they “failed to timely respond to [her] medical needs.” The claims fail because nothing the officers did — or did not do — established either a state-created danger or special relationship that imposed on them an affirmative duty to protect Montgomery from third-party harm. See Gatlin ex rel. Estate of Gatlin v. Green, 362 F.3d 1089, 1093 (8th Cir.2004). Without a state-created danger or special relationship, a failure to respond does not violate due process. See DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 197, 109 S.Ct. 998; Weeks v. Portage Cnty. Exec. Offices, 235 F.3d 275, 277-79 (6th Cir.2000); Bryson v. City of Edmond, 905 F.2d 1386, 1392-93 (10th Cir.1990).
