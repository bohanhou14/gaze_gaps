gold_text: With respect to the remaining documents listed in the district court’s order, Reliance’s letter cited pages 2-81 to 2-82 among the documents it contended would be unfair to disclose. But Reliance did not inform the Commission why this would be unfair. In this court appellants have not explained the nature of Reliance’s objections to these documents; so far as we can tell, they did not do so in the district court. We therefore decline to review the district court's order regarding these pages. See McBride v. Merrell Dow & Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 800 F.2d 1208, 1210-11 (D.C.Cir.1986); Carducci v. Regan, 714 F.2d 171, 177 (D.C.Cir.1983), quoting Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(4); Railway Labor Executives’ Ass'n v. U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, 749 F.2d 856, 859 n. 6 (D.C.Cir.1984).
