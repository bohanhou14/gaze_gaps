In examining whether the general court-martial had jurisdiction and acted within its powers, it is pertinent to reference Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65, which established that a court-martial's decision within its jurisdiction cannot be reviewed by civil courts. Additionally, Johnson v. Sayre, 158 U.S. 109, confirms that procedural missteps do not strip a court-martial of its jurisdiction if these do not affect the core fairness of the trial.

Furthermore, in light of In re Yamashita, 339 U.S. 103, the only point of inquiry is whether the court-martial had jurisdiction over the person and the offense and acted within its lawful powers. The case's circumstances show compliance with this standard, as the plaintiff was provided due notice and the trial conducted under proper authority. Finally, from 177 U.S. 496, we understand that military courts are final arbiters within their jurisdiction, and civil courts do not have the authority to overturn their decisions due to procedural errors, unless jurisdiction is surpassed.

Therefore, despite the procedural discrepancies claimed by the plaintiff, the general court-martial acted within its jurisdiction and lawful powers, affirming the validity of its findings and sentence.
