The case at hand involves an appeal from a jury conviction for unlawful possession of stolen mail matter. The trial court provided an instruction that possession of property recently stolen, if not satisfactorily explained, can be inferred that the person in possession knew the property had been stolen. The court also instructed that the same inferences may reasonably be drawn from a false explanation of possession of property recently stolen.

The appellant argues that the latter part of the instruction was unsupported by the evidence and could only serve to confuse the jury. However, the court points out that the witnesses offered explanations regarding the appellant's acquisition and possession of the stolen credit card, and even if the jury disbelieved their testimony, they could still draw the same inference from their "false explanations".

The court further instructed the jury on the appellant's constitutional right not to testify and that possession may be satisfactorily explained through other circumstances. The court holds that the jury could not be confused by the instruction and that the appellant's argument is specious and devoid of merit.

In regards to the trial court's instruction defining the term "stolen", the appellant objects that it is too broad, but fails to specify why. Under Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, error may not be assigned to any portion of a charge unless the complaining party states distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection. Since the appellant's objection does not meet this requirement, it is precluded from appellate review.

Furthermore, the trial court did not err in not declaring a mistrial following a question asked a witness by the prosecution concerning her viewing the appellant in a police line-up. The court sustained the appellant's objection and instructed the jury to disregard the question. The court holds that the questioning was not intended to imply that the appellant had prior criminal involvement, but rather was a legitimate inquiry into the witness's identification of the appellant.

In conclusion, the court holds that the trial court did not err in its instructions and that the appellant's arguments are without merit. The court relies on the principles set forth in reference cases such as 351 F.2d 111 and 453 F.2d 422, which emphasize the importance of sufficient evidence and the need to avoid confusing the jury with improper instructions.

United States, 351 F.2d 111 (CA8 1965). See also United States v. Straughan, 453 F.2d 422, 426 (CA8 1972) (and cases cited in fn. 3). Under the circumstances present, however, we fail to see how what transpired could have intimated a prior criminal involvement in the appellant’s past. The reference to a police line-up obviously related to the present charge against Sargis; to suggest otherwise is unfounded speculation. At most, the question constituted an unnecessary but harmless attempt to bolster the witness’ identification testimony given on direct examination.
