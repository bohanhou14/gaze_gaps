Based on the reference cases, it is clear that the constitutional right to counsel is not absolute and can be subject to certain limitations. In the case of Samuel Mays, the disqualification of his chosen attorney, Henry K. Jarrett, III, was not arbitrary or without adequate reasons. The government's representations that Jarrett had represented seven government witnesses during the grand jury investigation and had represented two of Samuel Mays' codefendants were undisputed, supporting an inference of actual or potential conflict of interest warranting disqualification (466 U.S. 648).

Furthermore, the delay of nearly five months before new counsel was appointed did not constitute reversible error. The deposition testimony was not introduced at the trial, and the witness was terminally ill and dying, so any delay might have deprived all of the litigants of the opportunity to depose a witness with relevant information (399 U.S. 42).

In addition, the District Court's refusal to give instructions on lesser included offenses was consistent with the test established in United States v. Moore, 917 F.2d 215, 228 (6th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 963, 111 S.Ct. 1590, 113 L.Ed.2d 654 (1991). The evidence of intent was overwhelming, and the District Court did not err in refusing to instruct on the lesser included offense.

In conclusion, the District Court did not err in denying the motions for severance, admitting the prejudicial hearsay testimony, or failing to grant a mistrial due to cumulative error. The constitutional rights of the defendants were not violated, and the convictions were supported by the evidence presented. Therefore, the judgments of the District Court are AFFIRMED.

gold_text: Finally, defendant argues that his 142-day delay without counsel amounted to a per se violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. But for delay in appointing counsel to violate the Sixth Amendment, the defendant must generally prove prejudice. United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 658, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2046, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984)(“Absent some effect of challenged conduct on the reliability of the trial process, the Sixth Amendment guarantee is generally not implicated.”); Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 54, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 1982-83, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970)(“[W]e are not disposed to fashion a per se rule requiring reversal of every conviction following tardy appointment of counsel_”). Having failed to show prejudice by the nearly five-month delay before he was appointed new counsel, Samuel Mays is not entitled to reversal of conviction on this ground.
