After reviewing the reference articles, it appears that the case 603 F.2d 182 is related to a legal dispute where the plaintiff made false statements to a government agent. The court found that the plaintiff's misstatements were intentionally misleading and upheld the agency's decision to dismiss the plaintiff.

In a similar vein, the case 603 F.2d 182 discusses the concept of substantial evidence and how it relates to the Merit Systems Protection Board's decision to uphold an employee's removal. The court states that substantial evidence means "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." This concept is also relevant to the case at hand, as the agency's decision to remove the employee was based on substantial evidence that the employee falsified government documents and attempted to defraud the government.

Furthermore, the case Boyce v. United States, 211 Ct. Cl. 57, 543 F.2d 1290 (1976), also discusses the concept of intent or willfulness in relation to an employee's actions. The court in this case found that the employee's misstatements were not made in good faith and therefore were not a mere good faith error. This is similar to the case at hand, where the employee's misstatements were also not made in good faith and were intentionally misleading.

In conclusion, the reference articles 603 F.2d 182 and Boyce v. United States, 211 Ct. Cl. 57, 543 F.2d 1290 (1976), provide valuable insights into the legal concepts relevant to the case at hand. The court's decision to uphold the agency's decision to remove the employee was based on substantial evidence and the employee's intentional misleading statements. The reference articles also highlight the importance of intent or willfulness in relation to an employee's actions.

gold_text: Petitioner argues that there is no substantial evidence to support the finding of intent to defraud the government with respect to Iberia Flight 943 because there was no written policy in effect defining the exact time to close a plane inspection. The case petitioner cites for support, Wise v. United States, 603 F.2d 182, 221 Ct.Cl. 105 (1979), does not go so far as to require a written policy. Wise holds that intent had not been shown when the individual had no reason to know of the agency policy. We hold that petitionerâ€™s prior suspension for the same misconduct now charged was adequate notice of the behavior expected of him. We are satisfied that there was sub stantial evidence of record to support the board finding of intent.
