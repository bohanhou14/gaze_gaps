In this case, the company petitioned the court for review of two orders issued by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on March 3, 1980, and September 30, 1980. The NLRB found that the company had committed numerous unfair labor practices during the employees' organizational drive. The Board also issued a Gissel bargaining order, which the company refused to comply with.

The court upheld the NLRB's findings of unfair labor practices and its conclusion that the company's refusal to bargain with the union was unlawful. The court also held that the company's discharge of Terry Boyter, a union activist, was unlawful and in violation of Section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act.

The court noted that the company's actions were contrary to the NLRB's holding in Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), which held that a bargaining order may issue where there is a finding of pervasive employer misconduct and the possibility of erasing the effects of such misconduct through traditional remedies is slight. The court also noted that the company's refusal to bargain with the union was similar to the situation in American Cable Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 608 F.2d 988, which held that a bargaining order is appropriate where the employer has committed numerous unfair labor practices and the employees' majority status has been eroded.

In conclusion, the court held that the NLRB's orders were supported by substantial evidence and were consistent with the NLRB's holdings in Gissel and American Cable Systems. The court also held that the company's refusal to comply with the NLRB's orders was unlawful. The court's decision underscores the importance of compliance with labor laws and the need for employers to engage in fair and respectful labor practices.

gold_text: The Board, relying on NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), issued an order requiring that the election be set aside if a tally of the ballots showed that the union had lost the election and requiring that the company bargain with the union. Under Gissel, a bargaining order without an election is proper if the company is found to have committed outrageous and pervasive unfair labor practices. If, however, the unfair labor practices are found not to have been egregious, a bargaining order is proper only if it is shown that the union once had a majority support, that such support had been dissipated by the employerâ€™s pervasive misconduct, and that the possibility of erasing the effects of the unfair labor practices and ensuring a fair election is slight. NLRB v. Appletree Chevrolet, Inc., 608 F.2d 988 (4th Cir. 1979). The Board found that this case fell within the latter category-
