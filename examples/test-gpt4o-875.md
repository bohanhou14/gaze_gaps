In this case, Krause argues that whether his statements were material should have been determined by the jury, not as a matter of law by the judge. This contention, however, is not supported by prevailing judicial standards. In reference case 322 F.2d 523, the court affirmed that materiality is indeed a question of law, supporting the notion that such determinations fall within the purview of the judiciary, not the jury. Likewise, reference case 231 F.2d 699 elucidates that the test for materiality hinges on whether the false statement had a natural tendency to influence or was capable of influencing the decision of the tribunal. There is significant jurisprudence, including Sinclair v. United States, 279 U.S. 263, and United States v. Clancy, 276 F.2d 617, which consistently upholds this legal principle. Applying the established test from Blake v. United States, 323 F.2d 245, Krause’s false statement about the contract signing date undeniably had a natural tendency to influence the NLRB's decision under the "contract in bar" rule. Thus, the trial court correctly prohibited evidence and summation regarding the general irrelevance of unsworn statements, affirming that materiality in this context is a legal determination.

gold_text: Virtually without exception, materiality has been held to be a matter of law. See, e. g., United States v. Ivey, 322 F.2d 523 (4th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 953, 84 S.Ct. 444, 11 L.Ed.2d 313 (1963); Weinstock v. United States, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 365, 231 F.2d 699 (D.C.Cir. 1956). Nevertheless, in the case before us, the judge charged the jury as to the standard for materiality and repeatedly referred to materiality as a jury question. But the judge excluded examination of Donald R. Holley on the question of whether a regional director can consider unsworn testimony in making his decision. The judge also indicated his intention to charge the jury that statements made by a person who appears before a hearing officer of the NLRB need not be sworn in order to be considered by the regional director. Since Krause’s statement cannot be material unless it was — or could have been — considered, the judge effectively decided the question of materiality as a matter of law. Appellant now asks us to remand this case in order to enable him to argue to the jury that Krause’s statement was not and could not have been considered by the regional director and therefore was not material. We decline to do so.
