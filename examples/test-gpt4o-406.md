Likewise, Boston cannot show that it was unreasonable for the Appellate Court of Illinois to uphold the trial court’s factual determination that no discrimination occurred. In support of this, the court noted, similar to the findings in 162 F.3d 481, the striking of multiple African-American jurors alone does not automatically indicate discrimination if the prosecutor provides race-neutral explanations. Here, the trial court accepted the reasons such as lack of long-term community ties and insufficient personal crime experience, reminiscent of the reasons provided in 476 F.3d 426 for why trials often encounter varied non-racially motivated juror exclusions. Additionally, the panel's decision aligns with the principle established in 375 F.3d 643, suggesting that an existing procedural framework was adequately followed to determine the voluntariness and neutrality of the prosecutor's reasons.

Moreover, the trial court's detailed review and the pattern of strikes observed do not reach the egregious level as in the case discussed in 368 F.3d 246, where the evidence of racial motivation was notably compelling. In Boston's case, the trial court’s experience with the prosecutor and thorough review of the voir dire records supported the conclusion that the strikes were part of legitimate trial strategy rather than racial discrimination. Thus, Boston has not provided "clear and convincing evidence" to contradict the presumption of factual correctness granted to the state court's findings. As such, we affirm the district court's denial of Boston’s § 2254 petition.

gold_text: Court of Illinois to affirm the trial court’s conclusion that the peremptory strikes were not motivated by race. The trial court was permitted to conclude that the strikes were race neutral based on (1) the circumstantial evidence culled from the voir dire transcript supporting the state’s race-neutral justifications for the strikes; and (2) the prosecutor’s description of his general practices in jury selection. See Morse v. Hanks, 172 F.3d 983, 984-85 & 985 n. 1 (7th Cir.1999); Mahaffey v. Page, 162 F.3d 481, 484 n. 1 (7th Cir.1998); cf Hardcastle v. Horn, 368 F.3d 246, 256-57 & 257 n. 4 (3d Cir.2004) (“ ‘[W]e are unprepared to hold ... that the state’s burden can never be carried without direct evidence from the decisionmaking prosecutor regarding his or her state of mind.’ ” (citations omitted)). This conclusion is “ ‘a pure issue of fact’ accorded significant deference,” Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 364, 111 S.Ct. 1859, and presumed correct unless Boston shows by clear and convincing evidence that it is not, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1); Rice, 546 U.S. at 338-39, 126 S.Ct. 969; Lamon, 467 F.3d at 1102; see also Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 n. 21, 106 S.Ct. 1712. Boston points to no such evidence, either in his § 2254 petition or his submissions to this court. Rather, he merely asserts—without elaboration—that the prosecution challenged the six prospective jurors because of their race; such a conclusory declaration alone is insufficient to establish on collateral attack a constitutional violation. See Rice, 546 U.S. at 338-39, 126 S.Ct. 969; Purkett, 514 U.S. at 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769 (per curiam); see also Daniels v. Knight, 476 F.3d 426, 434 (7th Cir.2007); Conner v. McBride, 375 F.3d 643, 652 (7th Cir.2004).
