The Defendant's argument that varying managerial policies and supervisor actions prohibit collective determination lacks merit. This aligns with the principle highlighted in the reference case 705 F.3d 770, where differences among supervisors' oversight did not negate the collective nature of FLSA violations. Just as in that case, where it was concluded that uniform unlawful practices by the employer were sufficient grounds for a collective action, the similarities in job duties, pay structure, and overtime encouragement by FleetCor outweigh any minor differences in supervisory practices.

Additionally, as in reference case 564 F.3d 1256, the entanglement of class certification issues with the merits of the case does not warrant decertification. The distinctions mentioned by Defendants, such as individual timesheets and specific managerial interactions, are more appropriate for damages calculation rather than liability determination. The court must prevent unnecessary convolution by separating these discrete factual variations from the overarching uniform policies alleged to violate the FLSA.

The court reiterates that the collective action remains an efficient means to adjudicate the claims of inside sales representatives at FleetCor. Consequently, the motion for decertification is denied in light of the substantial similarities in the employment conditions that give rise to the collective legal claim.

Therefore, the court DENIES Defendant’s motion for decertification [146].

gold_text: Although the court has denied Defendant’s motion for decertification, the parties apparently anticipate filing motions for summary judgment. It is possible that as the parties develop further evidence and potentially narrow liability ' issues, the court might have a different view of the suitability of a collective action. After resolution of any motions for summary judgment, if necessary, the court may require the parties to file trial briefs outlining the manner in which they intend to try/ defend the case before the jury. See, e.g., Espenscheid v. DirectSat USA, LLC, 705 F.3d 770, 775-76. (7th Cir.2013) (Posner, J.) (FLSA case); Vega v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 564 F.3d 1256, 1278-79 & n. 20 (11th Cir.2009) (Rule 23 class)
