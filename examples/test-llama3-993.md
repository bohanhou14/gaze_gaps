The legal cases referenced provide insight into the admissibility of evidence in criminal proceedings. In the case of Jackson v. United States (311 F. Supp. 1245), the court held that an illegal arrest does not render the evidence obtained as a result of the arrest inadmissible. Similarly, in United States v. Zimple (318 F.2d 679), the court found that evidence seized during an illegal search was admissible because the search was not conducted in bad faith.

In the present case, the issue is the admissibility of physical evidence seized during a search of apartment 10B at premises 400 Central Park West. The search was conducted after the defendant Vega was taken into custody, and the evidence seized included a brown paper bag containing heroin and cocaine. The defendant challenges the admissibility of this evidence, arguing that the search was illegal and that the evidence was obtained as a result of an illegal arrest.

The court must consider the admissibility of this evidence in light of the legal precedents referenced above. In United States v. Zimple, the court held that evidence seized during an illegal search is admissible if the search was not conducted in bad faith. Similarly, in Jackson v. United States, the court held that an illegal arrest does not render the evidence obtained as a result of the arrest inadmissible.

Applying these precedents to the present case, the court finds that the search of apartment 10B was not conducted in bad faith, and therefore the evidence seized during the search is admissible. Furthermore, the court finds that the evidence obtained during the search is not tainted by the illegal arrest of the defendant, and therefore it is admissible.

In conclusion, the court finds that the physical evidence seized during the search of apartment 10B is admissible in evidence. The defendant's illegal arrest does not render the evidence inadmissible, and the search was not conducted in bad faith. The court therefore overrules the defendant's motion to suppress the evidence.

The evidence seized, however, is inadmissible against Vega since the seizure is not relevant to the issues. It is only when the relationship between Vega and Washington is shown that the evidence is pertinent.
