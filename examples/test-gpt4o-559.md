In reviewing Sargis' contention regarding the trial court's denial of a mistrial following a prosecution question implying prior police involvement, it is essential to consider established precedents. The introduction of evidence or statements that may impeach a defendant's character without proper foundation can have prejudicial effects, as noted in 351 F.2d 111. In that case, the court emphasized that evidence damaging to a defendant’s character outside the scope of the charges can unduly influence a jury, necessitating a careful assessment of its admissibility.

Further, in 453 F.2d 422, the court highlighted the significant impact of erroneously admitted character evidence. Any such error, if not harmless, mandates reversal, particularly when it casts doubt on the fairness of the proceeding. Here, while the trial court immediately mitigated potential prejudice by sustaining the objection and instructing the jury to disregard the question, the initiation of this line of questioning could be construed as an attempt to introduce prejudicial character evidence indirectly, similar to the concerns raised in 453 F.2d 422.

However, the trial court's prompt corrective action aligns with the principle that cautionary instructions can sometimes suffice to cure the prejudicial effect of improper statements. Given the existing guidance and the mitigating measures employed, Sargis' argument for a mistrial, while not without some foundation, ultimately fails to demonstrate a substantial influence on the jury's verdict that warrants the conviction's reversal.

Therefore, considering the corrective actions taken and the relevant precedents, we uphold the trial court's decision not to declare a mistrial.

United States, 351 F.2d 111 (CA8 1965). See also United States v. Straughan, 453 F.2d 422, 426 (CA8 1972) (and cases cited in fn. 3). Under the circumstances present, however, we fail to see how what transpired could have intimated a prior criminal involvement in the appellant’s past. The reference to a police line-up obviously related to the present charge against Sargis; to suggest otherwise is unfounded speculation. At most, the question constituted an unnecessary but harmless attempt to bolster the witness’ identification testimony given on direct examination.
