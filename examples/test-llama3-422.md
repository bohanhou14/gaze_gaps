The case at hand involves a dispute between a plaintiff and a defendant regarding the termination of a contract and alleged First Amendment violations. The plaintiff, an independent contractor, claims that his contract was terminated due to his political beliefs and seeks damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

In considering the defendant's motion for summary judgment, the court must determine whether the plaintiff's First Amendment claims are viable. The court notes that the Supreme Court has extended First Amendment protection to public employees in cases such as Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), and Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983). However, it remains unclear whether this protection extends to independent contractors.

The Seventh Circuit has explicitly declined to extend Elrod-Branti protection to independent contractors in LaFalce v. Houston, 712 F.2d 292 (1983). The court in LaFalce noted that independent contractors have different interests and relationships with the government, and that extending Elrod-Branti protection to them would invite a flood of cases. The Third Circuit has also distinguished between independent contractors and public employees in Horn v. Kean, 796 F.2d 668 (1986).

In contrast, the Eighth Circuit has extended Elrod-Branti protection to independent contractors in certain circumstances. In Sweeney v. Bond, 669 F.2d 542 (1982), the court held that a politically motivated dismissal of independent contractors did not violate the First Amendment. Similarly, in Fox & Co. v. Schoemehl, 671 F.2d 303 (1982), the court found that an independent contractor's claim of First Amendment retaliation was not viable.

The court in this case finds that the plaintiff's claims are not viable under the First Amendment. The court is persuaded by the reasoning in LaFalce and Horn, and holds that independent contractors are not entitled to the same level of First Amendment protection as public employees. The defendant's motion for summary judgment is hereby granted.

gold_text: Similar reasoning to LaFalce and Horn has also been applied in other Circuits. The Eighth Circuit was unwilling “to extend the patronage decisions to cases which do not involve public employees.” Sweeney v. Bond, 669 F.2d 642, 545 (8th Cir.1982), cert. denied sub nom., Schenberg v. Bond, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S.Ct. 174, 74 L.Ed.2d 143 (1982). The Sixth Circuit, in a ease concerning qualified immunity, held no extension of the Elrod-Branti decisions to independent contractors had been “ ‘clearly established’ in 1983.” Lundblad v. Celeste, 874 F.2d 1097 ,1102 (6th Cir.1989), reh., 924 F.2d 627 (6th Cir.1991), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1250, 111 S.Ct. 2889, 115 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1991).
