In the case of 982 F.2d 633, the court ruled that a "likelihood of confusion" is not necessary for a gray market claim under the Lanham Act. The court held that the presence or absence of a material difference between the goods is the pivotal determinant of Lanham Trade-Mark Act infringement in a gray goods case.

In the present case, ACBC's claims for trademark infringement and unfair competition were dismissed by the district court. The court held that there were no material differences between the black and gray circuit breakers, and that the gray circuit breakers were "genuine" products.

The court's decision is consistent with the principle of territoriality of trademarks, which was established in A. Bourjois & Co. v. Katzel, 260 U.S. 689 (1923). The Katzel decision marked a shift from the principle of universality of trademarks to the principle of territoriality, under which a trademark has a separate legal existence in each country and receives the protection afforded by the laws of that country.

The court's decision is also consistent with the K Mart case, 486 U.S. 281 (1988), which held that gray market goods are those that are foreign-manufactured, bear a valid United States trademark, and are imported without the consent of the United States trademark holder.

In conclusion, the district court's dismissal of ACBC's claims is consistent with the principles of territoriality of trademarks and the definition of gray market goods. The court's decision is also consistent with the K Mart case, which held that gray market goods are those that are foreign-manufactured, bear a valid United States trademark, and are imported without the consent of the United States trademark holder.

gold_text: In the end, whether this is technically classified as a gray market case or not does not drive the solution. Ultimately, what is at issue is whether there is a likelihood of confusion as to source under the well established precedent of §§ 32 and 4B(a) of the Lanham Act. Neither Katzel nor K Mart preclude a finding of trademark infringement as a matter of law in this context. As McCarthy notes, “the ultimate issue in a trademark infringement suit against the importer of gray market imports is the factual question of likelihood of confusion of U.S. customers.” McCarthy, supra, § 29.46; see Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entm’t Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1053 (9th Cir.1999) (“The core element of trademark infringement is the likelihood of confusion, i.e., whether the similarity of the marks is likely to confuse customers about the source of the products.”) (citations omitted); New West Corp. v. NYM Co., 595 F.2d 1194, 1201 (9th Cir.1979) (“Whether we call the violation infringement, unfair competition or false designation of origin, the test is identical is there a ‘likelihood of confusion?’ ”); see also Societe Des Produits Nestle v. Casa Helvetia, Inc., 982 F.2d 633, 640 (1st Cir.1992) (“Whether the fulcrum of plaintiffs’ complaint is perceived as section 32(l)(a), section 42, or section 43(a), liability necessarily turns on the existence vel non of material differences between the products of a sort likely to create consumer confusion.”).
