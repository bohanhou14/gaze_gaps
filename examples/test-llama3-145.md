MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

The court finds that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and that the class representatives have satisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. The proposed settlement provides for refunds of 100% of the post-closing fee plus interest to each eligible claimant, and does not contain any provisions that would indicate unfairness or prejudice to any class member.

The court also finds that the class representatives have adequately represented the interests of the class, and that their claims are typical of the claims of the other class members. The class representatives have also demonstrated a sufficient level of involvement in the litigation to ensure that their interests are adequately represented.

The court further finds that the questions of law and fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.

The court notes that the settlement was the result of arm's length negotiations between the parties, and that the parties have agreed to a comprehensive settlement that provides for refunds to class members and payment of attorneys' fees.

Accordingly, the court grants preliminary approval of the proposed settlement and certifies the class for settlement purposes.
