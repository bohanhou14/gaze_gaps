In reviewing the case, it appears that the court has made an error in directing a verdict for the defendants. As stated in Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 411 F.2d 365, the court should consider all evidence, including that which supports the non-mover's case, in determining whether a directed verdict is appropriate. In this case, the plaintiff produced evidence that the defendant's turn signal was flashing, which could reasonably be inferred to indicate an intention to turn right. Additionally, the defendant was driving in the right-hand lane, slowing down as he approached the intersection, and actually began to turn his vehicle. These factors, combined with the plaintiff's testimony that he was familiar with the intersection, had stopped his vehicle before reaching the highway, and had looked at the truck the whole time, suggest that the jury could reasonably find that the defendant's actions were negligent.

As discussed in Alman Brothers Farms & Feed Mill, Inc. v. Diamond Laboratories, Inc., 5 Cir. 1971, 437 F.2d 1295, and Taylor v. Bair, 5 Cir. 1969, 414 F.2d 815, the court must consider the entire record and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it. In this case, the record suggests that the defendant's actions were negligent and that the plaintiff was unaware of the danger. Therefore, the court should not have directed a verdict for the defendants.

In conclusion, the court's decision to direct a verdict for the defendants was error. The plaintiff produced evidence that the defendant's turn signal was flashing, which could reasonably be inferred to indicate an intention to turn right. Additionally, the defendant's actions were negligent and the plaintiff was unaware of the danger. Therefore, the case should be remanded for a new trial. See, e.g., North Biver Insurance Co. v. Hubbard, 5 Cir. 1968, 391 F.2d 863; Employers Mutual Casualty Co. v. Mosqueda, 5 Cir. 1963, 317 F.2d 609.

gold_text: The Boeing case was meant to end the controversy regarding when the jury may be evicted from a case, but once again we have before us a case of unwarranted jury displacement. Although we are without the use of a computer to afford us a complete statistical survey, we nevertheless suspect that such cases are legion and that their ranks are increasing. See, e. g., Trawick v. Manhattan Life Ins. Co., 5 Cir. 1971, 447 F.2d 1293. In a case such as we have here, where shards of evidence have been produced on opposite sides of almost every issue, jury exile should be almost as rare as a museum piece. Boeing Co. v. Ship-manâ€™s guidelines are as engrained upon our jurisprudence as Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 1938, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188. Its every precept and inference was not heeded in the trial below, and we must therefore reverse and remand.
