In the context of the unseaworthiness doctrine, it is crucial to examine the provisions of both the bareboat charter and the time charter agreements. As previously established, the bareboat charter transferred full control and possession to Chaplin, making Chaplin the owner pro hoc vice and therefore responsible for the vessel’s seaworthiness at the time of the incident. Following the principles laid out in Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, and Morales v. City of Galveston, 370 U.S. 165, a ship’s gear, appurtenances, and manner of stowage must be reasonably fit for their intended purpose.

In addressing Plaintiff's allegations, it must be noted that the condition leading to the Plaintiff's injury must be attributable to the vessel's unseaworthy state rather than an isolated act of negligence by fellow crew members. As highlighted in 400 U.S. 494, an individual act of negligence does not render a vessel unseaworthy. Therefore, any claim of unseaworthiness must relate to inherent vessel deficiencies existing at the time of the charter’s inception or subsequently arising due to the charterer’s conduct.

With regards to the incineration barrel, the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to show that the vessel’s condition per 373 U.S. 206 was inherently unseaworthy at the time of the accident. The burn barrel itself does not appear to constitute an unseaworthy condition under the standards applied in earlier cases.

Based on the evidence and the precedents discussed, the movement for summary judgment by Chaplin on the grounds of unseaworthiness is not substantiated. Consequently, the motion for summary judgment by Mon River on grounds of the vessel's alleged unseaworthiness is GRANTED.

IV. 
In sum, the bareboat charter agreement effectively transferred ownership responsibilities to Chaplin, and no substantial evidence indicates unseaworthiness from Mon River’s side that would breach the express warranty concerning seaworthiness at delivery. Therefore, the court GRANTS the summary judgment for Mon River and DENIES Plaintiff's claim against Chaplin on the grounds presented.

It is so ordered.

Waterman Steamship Corp., 1963, 373 U.S. 206, 83 S.Ct. 1185, 10 L.Ed.2d 297, 1963 A.M.C. 1649, the Supreme Court concluded that ‘things about a ship, whether the hull, the decks, the machinery, the tools furnished, the stowage, or the cargo containers, must be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are to be used.’ Id. at 213, 83 S.Ct. at 1190, 10 L.Ed.2d at 303. More recently, in Usner v. Luckenbach, 1971, 400 U.S. 494, 91 S.Ct. 514, 27 L.Ed.2d 562, 1971 A.M.C. 277, the Supreme Court said that: ‘A vessel’s condition of unseaworthiness might arise from any number of circumstances. Her gear might be defective, her appurtenances might be in disrepair, her crew unfit. The number of men assigned to perform a shipboard task might be insufficient. The method of loading her cargo, or the manner of its stowage, might be improper. For any of these reasons, or others, a vessel might not be reasonably fit for her intended service.’ Id. at 499, 91 S.Ct. at 517-18, 27 L.Ed.2d at 562.”
