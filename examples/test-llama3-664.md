In this case, we are concerned with the applicability of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, which prohibit fraudulent practices in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. The appellants, who are shareholders of the Penn Central Company, argue that the exchange of shares pursuant to the 1969 reorganization was a "purchase or sale" of securities within the scope of Section 10(b).

The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, holding that the exchange of shares was not a "purchase or sale" of securities. The court relied on the Supreme Court's decision in National Securities, Inc. v. SEC, 393 U.S. 453 (1969), which held that a merger between two corporations constitutes a "purchase or sale" of securities. However, the court distinguished the present case from National Securities, Inc. because the reorganization in this case did not involve the combination of two existing corporations.

The appellants also argued that the reorganization affected their basic rights and interests, including the loss of their appraisal rights and their inability to participate in the bankruptcy proceedings of the Penn Central Transportation Company. However, the court held that these changes were internal corporate management decisions and not "purchases or sales" of securities.

The court also rejected the appellants' argument that the reorganization was a "purchase or sale" of securities because it enabled the holding company to diversify into non-railroad lines of business. The court held that the shareholders were not making a significant economic decision by means of their vote and that the added potential for diversification was in the nature of internal corporate restructuring.

In conclusion, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. The court's decision is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in National Securities, Inc. and with the analysis in Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 F.2d 461 (2d Cir. 1952). The court's decision also recognizes that the reorganization was an internal corporate management decision and not a "purchase or sale" of securities within the scope of Section 10(b).

In Eason, plaintiff shareholders had personally guaranteed liabilities of their corporation given in connection with the corporationâ€™s purchase of a business. When the business failed and the corporation went bankrupt, plaintiffs were held to have a 10(b) cause of action for fraud against the seller of the business.
