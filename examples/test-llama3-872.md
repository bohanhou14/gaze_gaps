Regarding the case, I agree with the court's decision in United States v. Moyer, 973 F.2d 857. The court correctly applied the armed career criminal guideline, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4, to enhance Moyer's sentence based on his three prior convictions for violent felonies.

Additionally, I believe the court properly declined to apply U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3(b) as the state and federal convictions did not involve the same course of conduct. This is in line with the decision in United States v. Johnson, 40 F.3d 1079, which held that § 5G1.3(b) only applies when the defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state court for the same course of conduct.

Furthermore, I agree with the court's decision to remand the case for resentencing, as the district court mistakenly believed it was required to impose a consecutive sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3(a). On remand, the district court should consider the directives set forth in U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3(c) and the application notes.

Finally, I would like to note that the court's decision highlights the importance of correctly applying the sentencing guidelines and avoiding plain error. This is in line with the decision in United States v. Vance, 938 F.2d 1096, which held that the error in enlarging the sentence in the absence of the defendant constituted plain error which can be noticed at any stage.

In conclusion, the court's decision in United States v. Moyer is well-reasoned and consistent with existing case law. I believe the court correctly applied the armed career criminal guideline and declined to apply U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3(b). The decision to remand the case for resentencing and the emphasis on avoiding plain error are also well-supported by the record.

gold_text: In United, States v. Johnson, this court concluded that the application of § 924(e)(1) is mandatory and “does not require government action to trigger its application nor does it vest discretion in the sentencing court not to apply its mandate.” 973 F.2d 857, 860 (10th Cir.1992). Based on our conclusion, supra, that Moyer’s three Wyoming felony convictions are “violent felonies,” it is clear that Moyer’s sentence should have been calculated by applying § 924(e)(1), not § 924(a)(2). Because the ten-year sentence imposed by the district court does not reflect the mandatory minimum mandated by § 924(e)(1) and Johnson, it is an illegal sentence. See United States v. Wainwright, 938 F.2d 1096, 1098 (10th Cir.1991) (defining an illegal sentence as one which “omits a term required to be imposed by statute”); see also U.S.S.G. § 5Gl.l(b) (“Where a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.”).
