I address the WMVDL claims first. Plaintiffs’ claims in paragraphs 24a(A) and (F) assert that GM unfairly allocated GMC trucks in violation of § 218.0123. To state a claim under the WMVDL, the plaintiff must provide well-pleaded factual allegations, and mere conclusory statements are insufficient (see 69 F.3d 123). Here, plaintiffs have not provided specific factual details to show how GM's truck allocations were unfair, nor have they alleged concrete facts that support their assertion of discrimination, which is necessary to withstand a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) (see 565 F.2d 1194).

In regard to the coercion claim under paragraph 24a(D), plaintiffs allege that GM forced them to order commodities or services they did not want. However, the WMVDL requires specific allegations showing how the coercive conduct directly caused the claimed harm. The conclusory nature of plaintiffs’ allegations does not meet the pleading requirements to survive the motion to dismiss, as mere unsupported conclusions are not admitted (see 925 F.2d 1555).

Thus, GM's motion to dismiss the claims in paragraphs 24a(A), (D), and (F) is granted for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

gold_text: While pleadings must be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and all well-pleaded facts accepted as true, a plaintiff is required to plead sufficient facts from which it may be inferred that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Northern Trust Co. v. Peters, 69 F.3d 123, 129 (7th Cir.1995). Allegations containing unsupported conclusions of fact or mixed fact and law are not accepted as true. Tamari v. Bache & Co. (Lebanon) S.A.L., 565 F.2d 1194, 1198-99 (7th Cir.1977). Further, conclusory statements are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. See Nelson v. Monroe Regional Medical Center, 925 F.2d 1555, 1559 (7th Cir.1991).
