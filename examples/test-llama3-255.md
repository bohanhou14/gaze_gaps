In reviewing the case, it is clear that the court's decisions were guided by established precedents. In the reference case 424 F.2d 1209, the court held that the introduction of testimony not sanctioned by the rules of evidence can be prejudicial error. Similarly, in the reference case 103 F.2d 876, the court noted that the admission of certain evidence not connected to the appellants could be prejudicial error.

In the present case, the court's decision to allow testimony concerning the defendant's reliance on his constitutional right to silence was deemed harmless error. This decision was supported by the United States Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Wick, 416 F.2d 61 (7th Cir. 1969).

Regarding the defendant's claim that the government's comments on her refusal to testify were prejudicial error, the court found that the evidence obtained via a valid search warrant and the defendant's own admissions of knowledge of the missing cartons were sufficient to support the verdict.

Furthermore, the court held that the defendant's claim that she was denied her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was made for the first time on appeal and was therefore barred by the principle that an appellant is in no position to complain of error when he made no objection during the trial.

In conclusion, the court's decisions were guided by established precedents and were supported by the evidence presented in the case. The verdicts were therefore affirmed. <answer>

gold_text: In so ruling, we recognize that error in the form of Agent Aros’ testimony and the closing remarks of the government’s counsel is a part of the record. United States v. Allsenberrie, 424 F.2d 1209 (7th Cir. 1970); United States v. Sprengel, 103 F.2d 876 (3rd Cir. 1939). Nevertheless, we are satisfied that what error was injected in the trial proceedings was “harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Appellant was apprehended at the border driving an automobile containing 266 pounds of contraband. Her testimonial profession that she was without any knowledge of the illicit cargo’s presence was inferentially refuted by the testimony of her daughter. In light of this evidence, we are satisfied that the three statements in controversy did not influence the jury’s decision. United States v. Wick, 416 F.2d 61 (7th Cir. 1969), cert. den. 396 U.S. 961, 90 S.Ct. 430, 24 L.Ed.2d 425 (1969).
