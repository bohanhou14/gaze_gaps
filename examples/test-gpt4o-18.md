**Generation:**

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a duty to ensure that advertising claims are not deceptive, false, or misleading, as highlighted in **186 F.2d 821**, where the court analyzed the deceptive claims made by Arrid regarding its effectiveness as a deodorant. Similarly, in the present case, the Commission finds that petitioners’ advertisements for Kleerex impliedly represented it as an effective treatment for pimples – a claim not supported by substantial evidence. 

The Commission’s reliance on Dr. Scott’s limited testimony and lack of practical testing or expertise with Kleerex does not provide a robust factual basis to substantiate their conclusions. In **288 U.S. 212**, the Supreme Court highlighted that unsupported findings on the effectiveness of a product can lead to an unwarranted conclusion. Here, although the ingredients of Kleerex exhibit properties like drying up lesions and decreasing the number of organisms on the skin, they do not substantiate the claim of overnight effectiveness. 

Moreover, as in the Royal Milling case (**288 U.S. 212**), the judicial review must ascertain if the Commission has made an “allowable judgment in its choice of remedy.” The examiner's sensible recommendation to correct the scope of the advertisements rather than issue an overarching cease and desist order aligns with fairness and practicality, and the Commission’s decision to reject this advice demonstrates overreach akin to making “a mountain out of a pimple.”

In conclusion, given the substantial evidence standard, the FTC's findings should be re-evaluated, considering the trial examiner’s original recommendations.
