**Generation:**

The analysis here is congruent with precedents established in prior cases. In **562 F.2d 1016**, federal law is applicable when there is a significant federal interest, particularly in SBA-related matters. Although in the instant case, the Ninth Circuit mandates the application of state law, the federal interest in recovering SBA loans remains a pivotal consideration. 

In **382 U.S. 341 (Yazell)**, the Supreme Court underscored that a federal interest in loan recovery does not automatically override state laws, especially when dealing with intricately negotiated transactions. This principle aligns with my decision to apply Washington’s statutes and rigorous standards for commercial reasonableness.

Moreover, **515 F.2d 1269** involved similar SBA loan default scenarios, which affirmed that the federal government can seek recovery against guarantors but must adhere to lawful and reasonable procedures in collateral disposition.

Given these precedents, it is clear that the SBA’s commercially unreasonable sale significantly impacts guarantor liability, thereby necessitating a reduction in their obligations. This approach ensures adherence to both federal interest and state law standards.

Yazell, 382 U.S. 341, 86 S.Ct. 500, 15 L.Ed.2d 404 (1966), and Chief Judge Coffin’s opinion in United States v. Olsen, 515 F.2d 1269, 1271 (1st Cir. 1975).
