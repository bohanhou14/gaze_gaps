The case of Briscoe v. United States involves a controversy surrounding the admission of evidence in a joint trial. The defendant, Nash, was convicted of drug trafficking offenses and appealed the decision. He argued that the district court erred in denying his motion for continuance and mistrial, and that the admission of certain evidence violated the Bruton rule.

Regarding the denial of the motion for continuance, the court held that Nash failed to demonstrate that the recent production of certain information regarding Officer Williams impaired his right to a fair and impartial trial. The court noted that Williams did not testify at the trial, and that the evidence of Nash's guilt was overwhelming.

As for the denial of the motion for mistrial, the court concluded that Nash's right to a fair and impartial trial was not impaired by the district court's limitations on his ability to engage in discovery regarding, or to present evidence at trial of, Detective Williams' alleged misconduct or the investigation thereof by the DEA or the OCPD.

The court also held that the admission of certain statements made by Kinchion, Nash's codefendant, violated the Bruton rule. The statements were incriminating and referred directly to Nash, despite not mentioning his name. The court noted that the context in which the statements were made and recounted to the jury admitted of no other possible inference.

In reference to the case of Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), the court held that the admission of a nontestifying codefendant's confession implicating the defendant at their joint trial violates the defendant's Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights. The court also noted that the rule announced in Bruton is a limited one, and that it only applies to statements that are so inculpatory as to the defendant that the "practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored."

In reference to the case of Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222 (1971), the court held that the admission of a statement made by a codefendant that was not directly incriminatory, but rather inferentially incriminating, did not violate the Bruton rule. The court noted that the decision in Harris placed outside the scope of Bruton's rule those statements that incriminate inferentially.

In conclusion, the court's decision in Briscoe v. United States was correct in denying the motion for continuance and mistrial

Florida, 405 U.S. 427, 430, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 31 L.Ed.2d 340 (1972). Reversal is unnecessary if “we can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the constitutional error was harmless.” Sarracino, 340 F.3d at 1160. The test for determining whether the error was harmless is “whether the jury would have returned the same verdict absent the error.” Washington v. Recuenco, — U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2546, 2552, 165 L.Ed.2d 466 (2006). In applying this standard, we review the record de novo, and our judgment is informed by the context in which the Bruton statement was admitted, how it was used at trial, and how it compares to the properly admitted evidence. Sarracino, 340 F.3d at 1160. “ ‘Our judgment must be based on our own reading of the record and on what seems to us to have been the probable impact of the ... confession ] on the minds of an average jury.’ ” Id.
