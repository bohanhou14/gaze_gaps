6. Admission of Statements After Arrest

Appellants further argue that any statements made by co-conspirators after their arrests should not have been admissible. However, as established in United States v. Marques, 600 F.2d 742, 750 (9th Cir. 1979), and reaffirmed in United States v. Wentz, 456 F.2d 634, 637 (9th Cir. 1972), a conspiracy is generally deemed to persist until the objectives of the conspiracy have been achieved or abandoned. Therefore, statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy can be admissible against all conspirators until the very end of the conspiracy.

In this case, the government demonstrated that the conspiracy did not end with Pinto's arrest; his co-conspirators were unaware and continued their activities. Thus, the statements made by co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy remain admissible per Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) as long as the conspiracy was ongoing (684 F.2d 1293).

Given that the conspiracy was still operational after Pinto's arrest, Taylor’s post-arrest recorded conversation seeking his commission with Thomas was proper evidence within the scope of the ongoing conspiracy (456 F.2d 634). Thus, the district court's decision to admit these statements was consistent with established precedent.

gold_text: Although Taylor’s phone conversation with Thomas occurred after Pinto and Omega had been arrested, it was nonetheless admissible against Taylor because the statements constitute admissions by him. See Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A). The conversation also was admissible against Pinto as co-conspirator statements. Although statements made by a co-conspirator after his arrest cannot be used against fellow conspirators, see United States v. Saavedra, 684 F.2d 1293, 1298 (9th Cir. 1982), the converse is not true; statements made by an unarrested co-conspirator who is still operating in furtherance of the ongoing conspiracy may be introduced against the arrested conspirator. Id.; United States v. Wentz, 456 F.2d 634, 637 (9th Cir.1972). Taylor was unaware that the plan to sell the blank bonds had ended with the arrest of Pinto and Omega. Absent such knowledge, the conspiracy remained in operation as Taylor was seeking to carry out its next step — receipt of his commission for introducing the buyer and seller. Consequently, there was sufficient evidence to support the district court’s conclusion that the statements by Taylor were made in furtherance of the conspiracy.
