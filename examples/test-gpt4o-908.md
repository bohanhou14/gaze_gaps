Petitioner's contention for in forma pauperis status is unavailing. He avers indigence warrants appellate review without prepayment of costs. Our analysis aligns with referenced cases requiring objective standard for "good faith" appeals (369 U.S. 438). The subjective belief in merit by the petitioner isn't sufficient. The Court must find the appeal non-frivolous to sanction in forma pauperis status. As per 261 F.2d 215, courts must avoid inundation with meritless appeals driven by lay perceptions of injustice.

Petitioner’s prior denied motions exemplify the consistent rejection of his claims by multiple judges. The frivolous nature of the appeal pervades this case’s narrative, as repetitive claims on swift trial rights have been substantively addressed and dismissed. Additionally, no new grounds or substantial evidence altering previous judgments were presented.

Given these precedents and findings, we deny the petitioner’s request for in forma pauperis status and sustain the dismissal of his appeal. The sanctity of judicial efficiency mandates we adhere to statutes guiding the dismissal of appeals attempting to exploit the system (369 U.S. 438; 261 F.2d 215).

The motion is thereby denied.
 
So ordered.
MacMAHON, District Judge.

This court will not authorize an appeal in forma pauperis under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a), and under the cited section certifies herewith that any appeal is not taken in good faith. In this context, good faith is judged by an objective standard, and if an appeal is frivolous it is not taken in good faith. Coppedge v.
