**Generation:**

Due to Frey not appealing his 2010 order, his habeas petition in July 2012 was time-barred. Relying on reference cases 163 F.3d 909 and 172 F.3d 381, Frey must demonstrate "actual innocence" to overcome this procedural default. “Actual innocence” means factual innocence, evidenced by showing that no reasonable juror would have convicted him (163 F.3d 909). 

The Supreme Court’s decision in McQuiggin v. Perkins allows a claim of actual innocence to bypass the statute of limitations (reference case 172 F.3d 381). Given the district court did not evaluate Frey’s innocence claim, our court remands for reassessment in light of Perkins. Regarding the 2011 proceeding, although the district court focused solely on the 2010 proceeding, Frey's allegations of ineffective assistance and Brady violations apply to 2011. We remand to assess whether Frey exhausted state remedies and, if so, to evaluate the merits of his habeas claims.

CONCLUSION
We VACATE the district court’s judgment and REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion. We express no opinion on the ultimate disposition of Frey’s § 2254 petition.

gold_text: . It is true that our court, albeit not in the Perkins context, has sometimes decided and rejected actual innocence claims in the first instance. See e.g., United States v. Torres, 163 F.3d 909, 912 (5th Cir.1999). But see United States v. Jones, 172 F.3d 381, 385 (5th Cir.1999) (remanding for a determination of actual innocence). In the instance circumstance, we elect to allow the district court to consider Frey’s claim in the first instance. See Ram-sukh v. INS, 203 F.3d 827, 1999 WL 1234713 at *2 (5th Cir.1999) (unpublished) ("[W]e believe that sound and orderly judicial procedure counsel remand to the district court to address in the first instance the merits, if any, of the petition.").
