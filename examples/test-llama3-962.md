The reference case 417 F.2d 1116 provides that in a conspiracy trial, the trial judge must decide the applicability of a technical exclusionary rule based on the non-hearsay evidence. The case 493 F.2d 359 states that the government must introduce sufficient independent evidence of the existence of a conspiracy and of the defendant's participation therein before the judge may allow declaration of a co-conspirator to go before the jury.

In the case at hand, the government's evidence, independent of the hearsay statements of Maige, is insufficient to prove the existence of a conspiracy and the defendant's participation therein. The evidence presented by the government includes the defendant's presence in a crowd to which Maige made an initial inquiry as to the possible purchase of cocaine, telephone records indicating calls between numbers listed to Maige in Ft. Lauderdale and to the defendant in Key West on June 27, 1972, the date of the sale, and the circumstance that the defendant, in the beige Cadillac, followed Maige into the parking lot adjacent to Maige's apartment shortly before the delivery of the cocaine.

However, the evidence presented by the government is not sufficient to support a finding that the defendant was himself a conspirator. The evidence is circumstantial and does not show that the defendant and Maige ever discussed the sale of cocaine to the government agents, that the defendant ever agreed to supply Maige with cocaine, or that the defendant ever actually furnished Maige with cocaine. No cocaine was ever shown to be in the defendant's possession.

In conclusion, the government's evidence, independent of the hearsay statements of Maige, is insufficient to prove the existence of a conspiracy and the defendant's participation therein. The necessary predicate was lacking, and hence the hearsay testimony detailing Maige's statements about his people from Key West should not have been permitted to go before the jury. Without the benefit of this hearsay, the government's conspiracy charge falls, and the aiding and abetting distribution of cocaine conviction under Count V collapses also. The judgment of conviction appealed from is reversed, with directions to the lower court to dismiss the indictment.

gold_text: . We recognize that this approach, at first blush, appears to render submission of the hearsay declarations for the consideration of the jury superfluous. As the Second Circuit has pointed out, however: “Although the proof aliunde may suffice for submission to the jury, the jury might not be convinced, by it and the utterances might tip the scale.” United States v. Geaney, 2 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 1116, 1120, cert. denied sub nom. Lynch v. United States, 1970, 397 U.S. 1028, 90 S.Ct. 1276, 25 L.Ed.2d 539. It should be noted that the Second Circuit has expressly refused to adopt the prima facie test for admissibility of co-conspirator hearsay. That court relies instead on a determination whether, weighing all the evidence, the government has proved the defendant’s participation in the alleged conspiracy by “a fair preponderance of the evidence independent of the hearsay utterances.” Id. If so, then the hearsay is admissible. Accord, United States v. D’Amato, 2 Cir. 1974, 493 F.2d 359.
