**Generation:**

Applying the standards articulated in reference cases 145 F.3d 286 and 272 F.3d 722, our review necessitates an examination first of the legal correctness of the Plan Administrator’s interpretation and second of whether there was an abuse of discretion. The Plan Administrator adhered to a uniform interpretation consistent with a fair reading of the Plan, particularly by excluding from coverage injuries sustained during “travel to and from work,” which aligns with the legal principles in both cases mentioned.

In our de novo review, we must also determine whether the administrator's decision is supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary. The absence of limiting language such as “every day” found in other cases (referenced in Duffer) supports the administrator's strict interpretation of "travel to and from work." As reasoned in both reference cases, the Plan Administrator’s methodology—seeking detailed employment records and confirming job duties—demonstrates adherence to ERISA’s requirement for reasoned decision-making based on relevant evidence.

Given that the Plan Administrator was vested with discretion, had no conflict of interest, and applied consistent interpretations, our evaluation concludes that there was neither legal error nor abuse of discretion. As emphasized in 145 F.3d 286, the court’s task is not to substitute its own judgment but to ensure reasonableness—a benchmark the Plan Administrator's decision comfortably meets.

Thus, in line with our precedents, we hold that the Plan Administrator did not err legally or abuse discretion. We reverse the district court's judgment and render a decision in favor of defendants.
