**Generation:**

Debtor's reliance on his testimony alone to prove the mailing of his tax returns is insufficient. According to 26 U.S.C. ยง 7502, the only method for proving delivery of non-received documents is by registered or certified mail. As the debtor did not send his returns using either of these methods, his testimony cannot suffice.

This position is consistently upheld by case law. In Miller v. United States, 784 F.2d 728 (6th Cir.1986), the court emphasized that delivery must be proven through evidence of mailing by registered or certified mail for claims not received by the IRS. Similarly, in Deutsch v. Commissioner, 599 F.2d 44 (2d Cir.1979), the court stated that testimony or circumstantial evidence is not adequate to establish the mailing date when section 7502 applies, further supported by Shipley v. Commissioner, 572 F.2d 212 (9th Cir.1977), and Drake v. Commissioner, 554 F.2d 736 (5th Cir.1977).

The precedent set forth in these cases underscores the necessity of objective proof, as reaffirmed in the recent case 909 F.2d 148, which reinforces that such strict criteria are in place to maintain consistency and avoid subjective disputes over mailing dates.

Therefore, the debtor's objection to the IRS's claim fails due to lack of concrete evidence as mandated by ยง 7502 and established case law, such as 77 B.R. 967 and Miller v. United States.
