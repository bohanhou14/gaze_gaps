Petitioner’s argument that the Ohio Court of Appeals ignored the Supreme Court’s guidance in Dominguez Benitez is not persuasive. The court’s analysis did consider the context and circumstances surrounding the change of plea hearing. Furthermore, the petitioner failed to demonstrate that, but for his counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance, he would not have pleaded guilty and instead insisted on going to trial, as required by Strickland and Hill. As highlighted in McGowan’s case (788 F.3d 510), similar claims of misunderstanding the plea deal were dismissed due to lack of credible evidence that the trial court would have accepted alternative sentencing. Moreover, in Hodges (727 F.3d 517), claims of ineffective counsel were dismissed given the failure to show how the alleged deficiency would have altered the outcome significantly.

Accordingly, the state court's application of Strickland's prejudice prong is not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, nor is it based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. Therefore, the district court’s decision to dismiss the habeas corpus petition is affirmed.

gold_text: First, it was not an unreasonable application of federal law to give more weight to petitioner’s contemporaneous expressions of unwillingness to proceed to trial— in the context of the trial court inquiring whether he wished to pursue a trial on the affirmative defense, no less — than a subsequent repudiation made after an adverse ruling and an opportunity to second-guess the decision. See McGowan v. Burt, 788 F.3d 510, 517 (6th Cir.2015), cert. denied — U.S. —, 136 S.Ct. 415, 193 L.Ed.2d 328 (2015) (mem.) (“[CJonsonant with Strickland’s cautionary note about a defendant’s natural tendency to second-guess his attorney’s assistance after an adverse judgment, the state court scrutinized [the petitioner’s] asserted misunderstanding in light of what was said at the time he rejected the plea offer without the distorting effects of hindsight.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Hodges v. Colson, 727 F.3d 517, 539 (6th Cir.2013) (“A self-serving statement ... filed as a required part of [the petitioner’s] verified petition for post-conviction relief, cannot establish a reasonable probability that [he] would have pled not guilty but for the advice of counsel, where all objective evidence points unequivocally to the contrary.”).
