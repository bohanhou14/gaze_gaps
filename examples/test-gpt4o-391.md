The issue at hand involves the trustees' failure to pursue arbitration as a prerequisite to filing suit. Reference case 740 F.2d 160 highlights the importance of analyzing collective bargaining and trust agreements to determine the applicability of arbitration provisions. The court in Schneider Moving & Storage Co. v. Robbins concluded that arbitration clauses must explicitly include trustees to impose such requirements on them. Here, the court similarly found that the general arbitration provisions did not apply to the trustees, as they referred only to claims by the employer, the union, or the Association. This aligns with the reasoning of Schneider Moving Co., confirming that the exclusion of trustees was deliberate.

Furthermore, reference case 701 F.2d 1238 reinforces federal courts' authority to enforce the exhaustion of administrative remedies. Despite plaintiffs' arguments, overriding well-established federal policy favoring exhaustion, especially in ERISA cases, is insufficient. Therefore, without exhausting the arbitration process, the trustees' suits are procedurally flawed. Thus, plaintiffs' reliance on their fiduciary status under ERISA does not absolve them of their duty to follow the trust agreements' arbitration requirements.

Since the trustees did not comply with the arbitration prerequisites specified in the agreements, their actions violate both the Taft-Hartley Act and ERISA's stipulations for joint administration and majority decision-making (29 U.S.C. §§ 186(c)(5), 1104(a)(1), 1102(a)(1), 1144(d)). Accordingly, the dismissal of the suits was justified.

Considering the firmly established federal policy and relevant case law, the trustees must first seek arbitration to resolve internal deadlocks before pursuing judicial remedies.

gold_text: The plans involved in these suits have expressly provided a remedy for deadlock among the trustees on the question whether to sue under the trust agreements for contributions. Before pursuing judicial remedies, the trustees must comply with the arbitration procedures. See O’Hare v. General Marine Transport Corp., 740 F.2d 160, 168 (2d Cir.1984), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1181, 84 L.Ed.2d 329 (1985). Permitting the Union-appointed trustees to sue without first submitting the issue to arbitration would violate the firmly established federal policy favoring exhaustion of administrative remedies in ERISA cases. See Kross v. Western Electric Co., 701 F.2d 1238, 1244 (7th Cir.1983). Because the trustees have not exhausted their administrative remedies, their actions are premature and were properly dismissed.
