Following the rationale in LaFalce and Horn, other circuits have similarly refused to extend First Amendment protections to independent contractors. For instance, the Eighth Circuit has consistently held that politically motivated dismissals of independent contractors do not violate the First Amendment. In Sweeney v. Bond, 669 F.2d 542, the court concluded that independent contractors do not enjoy the same First Amendment protections as public employees (874 F.2d 1097). Additionally, in Fox & Co. v. Schoemehl, 671 F.2d 303, it was determined that the termination of a city auditor, categorized as an independent contractor, did not infringe on First Amendment rights (671 F.2d 303).

More recently, the Seventh Circuit acknowledged that while the Supreme Court in Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois expanded First Amendment protections for government employees, it did not extend those protections to independent contractors (938 F.2d 705). This underscores the prevailing judicial sentiment that there is a clear distinction between public employees and independent contractors regarding First Amendment protections (892 F.2d 583).

Given the weight of authority and consistent judicial reluctance to blur the lines between public employees and independent contractors, this Court finds that extending free speech protections to independent contractors, as argued by the plaintiff, is unwarranted. Based on existing case law and the specific facts of this case, the Defendant is entitled to summary judgment.

gold_text: Similar reasoning to LaFalce and Horn has also been applied in other Circuits. The Eighth Circuit was unwilling “to extend the patronage decisions to cases which do not involve public employees.” Sweeney v. Bond, 669 F.2d 642, 545 (8th Cir.1982), cert. denied sub nom., Schenberg v. Bond, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S.Ct. 174, 74 L.Ed.2d 143 (1982). The Sixth Circuit, in a ease concerning qualified immunity, held no extension of the Elrod-Branti decisions to independent contractors had been “ ‘clearly established’ in 1983.” Lundblad v. Celeste, 874 F.2d 1097 ,1102 (6th Cir.1989), reh., 924 F.2d 627 (6th Cir.1991), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1250, 111 S.Ct. 2889, 115 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1991). For other decisions refusing to extend Elrod-Branti protection to independent contractors see Downtown Auto Parks, Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, 938 F.2d 705, 710 (7th Cir.1991) (“All circuits considering the question of whether to extend the holdings of Elrod and Branti to independent contractors have declined.”), cert., denied, — U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 640, 116 L.Ed.2d 657 (1991); Triad Associates, Inc. v. Chicago Housing Authority, 892 F.2d 583 (7th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 845, 111 S.Ct. 129, 112 L.Ed.2d 97 (1990); Fox & Co. v. Schoemehl, 671 F.2d 303 (8th Cir.1982).
