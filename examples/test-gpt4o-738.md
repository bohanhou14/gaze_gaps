With regard to the increased sentence for Sanya on remand, it is imperative to consider the principles laid out in the key cases. In **395 U.S. 711 (Pearce)**, it is established that due process requires that any vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the subsequent sentence. The Court stipulated that reasons for any increased sentence must "affirmatively appear" and be based on objective information concerning identifiable conduct by the defendant occurring after the original sentencing.

Similarly, in **490 U.S. 794**, the Court emphasized the necessity of avoiding any presumption of vindictiveness unless the reasons for the harsher sentence are clear and justified by new, objective information. The underlying rationale is to prevent any deterrent effect on the defendant’s right to appeal.

However, in **444 F.3d 250**, it was noted that valid reasons associated with the need for flexibility and discretion in sentencing could justify a longer sentence without a presumption of vindictiveness. As long as the reasons are transparently recorded and linked to the defendant’s conduct, and there's no reasonable likelihood the sentence was based on actual vindictiveness, such a sentence stands.

Applying these standards, in Sanya’s case, there is no indication of judicial vindictiveness. The reasons for the sentences, as recorded, are tied to Sanya’s conduct and supported by the presented evidence. Moreover, the district court's detailed explanation for the consecutive sentences reflects a thoughtful application of the sentencing guidelines and relevant case law, ensuring procedural fairness and due process.
