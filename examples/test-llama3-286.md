Based on the provided references, I will summarize the key points and provide a concise answer.

The references primarily focus on whether a district court can withdraw a reference to a bankruptcy court sua sponte, without showing cause, after its appellate jurisdiction has been invoked. In the case of 910 F.2d 1160, the Third Circuit held that the district court may withdraw the reference only for cause shown, citing 28 U.S.C. § 157(d).

In another case, 777 F.2d 992, the Fifth Circuit emphasized the importance of promoting uniformity in bankruptcy administration, reducing forum shopping and confusion, fostering the economical use of the debtors' and creditors' resources, and expediting the bankruptcy process.

In the context of the current case, the adversary action is a core proceeding under 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(A), as it concerns causes of action which arose post-petition under an insurance contract formulated post-petition. The bankruptcy court is familiar with the parties, the factual background of the case, and the legal issues involved.

Considering the reasons above, I conclude that the district court's reference should be withdrawn for cause shown, as it would promote judicial economy. The bankruptcy court is well-equipped to handle the adversary action, and the parties have already invested time and resources in the case.

The court's denial of Travelers' Motion to Withdraw Reference should be reconsidered, as it would prevent manifest injustice. Travelers' Answer with a Jury Demand and its plea that it does not consent to a jury trial conducted by the bankruptcy judge further support the need for reconsideration.

gold_text: Although there is no statutory definition of what constitutes “cause shown” under 28 U.S.C. § 157(d) for permissive withdrawal of a reference, “the statute requires in clear terms that cause be shown before the reference can be withdrawn.” In re Pruitt, 910 F.2d 1160, 1168 (3d Cir. 1990). The Third Circuit has set forth several factors which the District Court should consider when deciding whether to withdraw the reference in order to promote judicial economy: (1) promoting uniformity in bankruptcy administration; (2) reducing forum shopping and confusion; (3) fostering the economical use of the debtors’ and creditors’ resources; and (4) expediting the bankruptcy process. Id. at 1165 (adopting Holland Am. Ins. Co. v. Succession of Roy, 777 F.2d 992, 999 (5th Cir.1985)). In determining whether cause is shown, courts generally begin by considering the threshold question of whether the matter to be withdrawn is “core” or “non-core” to the bankruptcy case. In re Pelullo, No. 95-22430, 1997 WL 535155 (E.D.Pa. Aug.15, 1997). Another factor to consider when determining whether cause is shown for withdrawal is whether or not there has been a jury demand and, if so, whether the party demanding the jury trial is entitled to a trial by jury. This Court has already determined that the adversary action is core. Therefore, in the matter sub judice, this Court must first determine if Travelers is entitled to a jury trial. If Travelers is entitled to a jury trial, then this Court must decide whether the principles of judicial economy would be better served by withdrawing the reference to the Bankruptcy Court.
