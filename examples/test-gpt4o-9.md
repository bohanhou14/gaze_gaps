Section 455(a) of 28 U.S.C. mandates that any justice, judge, or magistrate must disqualify themselves in any proceeding where their impartiality may reasonably be questioned. Similar principles were applied in the case referenced as 261 F.3d 1075, where motions for recusal were denied based on the argument of perceived partiality due to earlier rulings and a law clerk’s previous employment at a related law firm. This case emphasizes that impartiality must be assessed based on reasonableness and factual basis.

Moreover, the Supreme Court in 384 U.S. 563 reaffirmed the essential principle that bias and prejudice necessitating recusal must stem from an extrajudicial source, not from a judge's participation in the case or their judicial conduct therein. In my questioning of Ms. Gwynn's compliance with the Local Rules, there was no external influence or bias; rather, the actions were within judicial discretion to ensure adherence to procedural norms.

Given these precedents, none of Ms. Gwynn’s allegations meet the statutory or jurisprudential threshold for recusal under 28 U.S.C. § 455. The mere fact that judicial decisions were adverse to her or included rigorous procedural enforcement does not establish bias or partiality warranting disqualification.

gold_text: As noted above, recusal under § 455(a) is required “in any proceeding in which [a judge’s] impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” thus requiring re-cusal where the judge has acted in such a way as to give the appearance of partiality to a reasonable person. A judge’s rulings and expressions of opinion generally fail to justify recusal. As the Eleventh Circuit has put it, “adverse rulings alone do not provide a party with a basis for holding that the court’s impartiality is in doubt.” Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1075, 1103 (11th Cir.2001). Of course judges hold and express opinions about the litigants and issues that they have formed during court proceedings. But as the Supreme Court succinctly stated in United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966): “The alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source ... other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.”
