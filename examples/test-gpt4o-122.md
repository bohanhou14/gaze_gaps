In light of the aforementioned facts, it is essential to consider precedent where an unconditional pardon was issued to restore civil rights forfeited by court-martial proceedings. In 107 Ct. Cl. 650 and 69 F. Supp. 205, the court overruled demurrers where the plaintiff was granted a full and unconditional pardon by the President upon the recommendation of the Secretary of War. These cases illustrate the impact and potential nullification of court-martial proceedings following an unconditional pardon. Here, however, the elements of the alleged conflict of interest in representation and procedural fairness must be critically examined. Neither the pardoning precedent nor subsequent reviews mitigate the principle established in 315 U.S. 60 regarding the appellate review's finality and conclusiveness. These references collectively underscore the stringent review mechanisms and limitations of rectifying errors post-conviction, emphasizing the discretionary nature of judicial relief in such cases.

gold_text: One thing we may be sure of: if Captain Sullivan (as counsel for Gallagher alone) had done what it is now said he should have, and if it had turned out badly, the outcry against Captain Sullivan would have been equally as great as it now is. The whole setup seems unfortunate and well calculated to assure that assigned defense counsel will never dare take the bold and imaginative steps by which paid defense counsel so often achieve the effects they do. We assume that denying an accused soldier the right to counsel denies him a constitutional right. Shapiro v. United States, 107 Ct. Cl. 650, 69 F. Supp. 205 (1947), and further that assigning counsel with a conflict of interest is constitutionally equivalent to denying counsel. Glosser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60 (1942). The fact still remains, unless the mere assertion of a conflict of interest is to be constitutionally the equivalent of its actuality, someone must determine if the conflict is real or based on speculations too remote for any substantial influence on decisions. The presumption of propriety of official acts obliges us to suppose that those con cerned intended Gallagher to be defended by .counsel who would be able to give him undivided loyalty. The facts giving rise to the alleged conflict being as apparent as they ever became from the statements of Gallagher and Hughes to the C.I.D., long before the trials, we must further suppose, nothing to the contrary appearing, that the asserted conflict of interest was then deemed insubstantial so far as it was adverted to at all. The Board of Beview necessarily determined, in its turn, though without opinion, that the conflict was insubstantial. We think such determinations are in an area where a tribunal which daily reviews courts-martial might be hoped to have better antennae for the imponderable and the unspoken than we would.
