The denial of a certificate of appealability as it pertains to the other claims is grounded in the applicability of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c), which mandates that a prisoner must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right to obtain certification for appeal (193 F.3d 913). In this regard, the district court's assessment mirrors previous precedents, such as Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, and Davis v. Borgen, 349 F.3d 1027, emphasizing that only claims demonstrating that reasonable jurists could find the district court's rulings debatable can proceed (641 F.3d 830).

Furthermore, Dooley's appeal did not present any new information to challenge the district court's decision. His ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails to meet the Strickland v. Washington standard, as Dooley has not shown that the lawyer’s actions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance, nor that any alleged deficiencies prejudiced the outcome of the trial (466 U.S. 668). Since non-certified claims are not properly before this court, following Ramunno v. United States, 264 F.3d 723, and Schaff v. Snyder, 190 F.3d 513, the court declines to address these additional uncertified claims (641 F.3d 830).

Thus, we affirm the district court’s decision without requiring an evidentiary hearing, consistent with established jurisprudence under AEDPA regulations (193 F.3d 913).

gold_text: Finally, Dooley argues that the district court erred by concluding that he failed to substantiate his accusations that the government used fraudulent evidence to secure his convictions. But this contention is outside the scope of our certificate of appealability, and so we decline to review it. See 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(3); Lavin v. Rednour, 641 F.3d 830, 832 (7th Cir.2011); Rodriguez v. Scillia, 193 F.3d 913, 920 (7th Cir.1999).
