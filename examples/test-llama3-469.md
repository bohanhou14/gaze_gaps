In the context of legal cases, fraudulent joinder refers to the act of joining a party to a lawsuit solely to defeat diversity jurisdiction. In other words, a party joins a nondiverse defendant to a lawsuit with the intention of preventing the case from being removed to federal court. The courts have established a strict standard for determining fraudulent joinder, which requires the removing party to show that there is no possibility that the plaintiff could establish a cause of action against the nondiverse defendant.

In the case of 893 F.2d 98, the court held that the removing party bears the burden of demonstrating fraudulent joinder. The court also established the standard for judging fraudulent joinder claims, which requires the court to determine whether the nonremoving party has any possibility of recovery against the party whose joinder is questioned.

In the case of 882 F.2d 187, the court emphasized that fraudulent joinder must be proved "with particularity and supported by clear and convincing evidence" by the removing party. The court also stated that a party will be considered fraudulently joined "when the plaintiff has not stated a claim for relief or does not intend to secure a judgment against that defendant."

In the context of the case presented, the removing party, Miles, argues that the nondiverse defendants, Dr. Andres and Tulane, were fraudulently joined because the plaintiffs failed to convene a medical-review panel before filing suit. However, the court holds that the plaintiffs did not fraudulently join Dr. Andres and Tulane because they have stated a viable cause of action under which the doctor or Tulane could be found liable, if the evidence supports their claims. The court also notes that the obligation to narrowly construe removal jurisdiction and the burden of proving fraudulent joinder are heavy ones.

In conclusion, fraudulent joinder is a serious issue that can have significant consequences for the parties involved. The courts have established a strict standard for determining fraudulent joinder, and the removing party bears the burden of demonstrating fraudulent joinder. In this case, the court holds that the plaintiffs did not fraudulently join Dr. Andres and Tulane because they have stated a viable cause of action under which the doctor or Tulane could be found liable, if the evidence supports their claims. Therefore, the case must be remanded to state court.
