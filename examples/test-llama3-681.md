The case at hand is a complex antitrust issue, and it is crucial to carefully examine the facts and the applicable legal principles. The exclusivity clause in question has been challenged by U.S. Healthcare as a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act. The clause, which was adopted by Healthsource, requires doctors to agree not to serve any other HMO other than Healthsource.

In analyzing this claim, we must consider the per se and "quick look" rules. However, as the Supreme Court has held in cases such as Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Ass'n v. United States, 234 U.S. 600, 34 S.Ct. 951, 58 L.Ed. 1490 (1914), and Fashion Originators' Guild of America, Inc. v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 61 S.Ct. 703, 85 L.Ed. 949 (1941), exclusivity arrangements are not inherently suspect and may be justified by legitimate business purposes.

Furthermore, the Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 81 S.Ct. 623, 5 L.Ed.2d 580 (1961), decision emphasizes the importance of considering the probable effect of the exclusivity contract on the relevant area of effective competition. The court must weigh the potential impact of the clause on competition, taking into account various factors such as the probable immediate and future effects which pre-emption of that share of the market might have on effective competition therein.

In this case, U.S. Healthcare has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the exclusivity clause has had a substantial foreclosure effect on competition. The clause may have provided an incentive for doctors to remain loyal to Healthsource, but this does not necessarily mean that it has significantly limited the ability of new HMOs to enter the market.

In conclusion, based on the evidence presented, the exclusivity clause does not violate section 1 of the Sherman Act. The court's decision is consistent with the principles established in cases such as United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940), and Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 105 S.Ct. 2613,

gold_text: Whether the law requires such a further showing of likely impact on consumers is open to debate. Our own case law is not crystal clear on this issue. Compare Interface Group, Inc. v. Mass. Port Authority, 816 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir.1987), with Corey v. Look, 641 F.2d at 36. Ultimately the issue turns upon antitrust policy, where a permanent tension prevails between the "no sparrow shall fall" concept of antitrust, see Klor's, 359 U.S. at 213, 79 S.Ct. at 710 (violation "not to be tolerated merely because the victim is just one merchant whose business is so small that his destruction makes little difference to the economy"), and the ascendant view that antitrust protects "competition, not competitors". See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 488, 97 S.Ct. 690, 697, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977). We need not confront this issue in a case where the cardinal requirement of a valid claim — significant foreclosure unreasonably restricting competitors — has not been demonstrated.
