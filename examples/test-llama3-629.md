In the context of the reference case 451 U.S. 504, it is clear that the DRG system, as a state regulatory system, is preempted by federal law because it interferes with HCP's ability to operate effectively as an HMO. The court must consider the federal program's goals and whether the state regulation frustrates those goals.

In Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 414 U.S. 117, the court considered whether state regulations were preempted by federal law. The court held that federal regulation of a field of commerce should not be deemed preemptive of state regulatory power in the absence of persuasive reasons.

In this case, the DRG system, as a state regulatory system, is preempted by federal law because it frustrates the goal of the federal program to provide decent health care at a reasonable price. The federal program's goals are to promote the financial success of HMOs and to make affordable health care available to the public. The DRG system, by reducing the financial incentives for HMOs to negotiate per diem contracts with hospitals, frustrates these goals.

Furthermore, the court must consider the federal program's involvement with HCP, including the grant of federal qualification and the provision of financial aid. The court finds that the DRG system is a direct impediment to repayment of HCP's loans and to the provision of services to its subscribers.

In conclusion, the DRG system is preempted by federal law because it interferes with HCP's ability to operate effectively as an HMO and frustrates the goals of the federal program. The court grants HCP's request for declaratory and injunctive relief.

gold_text: Plaintiff contends that the existence of per diem contracts has been the reason why HCP has kept its costs down and the reason why the public would be induced to enroll as members of HCP. The per diem contracts, also, had given HMOs like HCP a competitive advantage over more traditional sources of medical care, because they had given HCP physicians a financial inducement to reduce the amount of time spent in hospitals by HCP subscribers. Under the DRG system, the advantage derived from the shortening of hospital stays shifts to the hospitals themselves, along with the inducement to do so. Nevertheless it cannot be said that HCP has thereby lost its entire competitive advantage. By the use of pre-hospitalization testing and by emphasis on preventive care, HMOs remain in a unique position to minimize the costs to its subscribers. Moreover, there is no basis for the assertion that Congress intended to give HMOs a competitive advantage in the medical marketplace. The act dealing with HMOs contains several provisions which set HMOs on an equal footing with other medical care suppliers, see, 42 U.S.C. section 300e-10, 300e-ll, but there is no provision which is aimed at guaranteeing that they will forever thrive in the competitive marketplace. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that state regulation is not to be displaced by a federal program unless “Congress has unmistakably so ordained.” Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U.S. 504, 101 S.Ct. 1895, 1905, 68 L.Ed.2d 402 (1981). Because Congressional intent to preempt state laws is not to be lightly inferred, e.g., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Ware, 414 U.S. 117, 127, 94 S.Ct. 383, 389, 38 L.Ed.2d 248 (1973), the court declines to give the expansive reading to the federal statutes which the plaintiff advocates.
