The federal copyright claim in this case centers around the issue of whether DT's 3-D rendition of the PlumbBob as a USB flash drive is entitled to copyright protection as a derivative work. The court holds that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the manner in which DT designed the USB flash drive to fit into the PlumbBob object was artistic and non-functional, warranting a jury trial.

The court also finds that the question of originality warrants a jury trial, as there is a dispute over whether EA exercised control over the design of the USB drive. The court notes that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that EA was merely in a position to offer suggestions, but did not ultimately "give effect to the idea" of how the USB flash drive fit into the PlumbBob object.

In the alternative, EA argues that even if the differences between the 2-D and 3-D PlumbBobs were not trivial, DT was not a joint author as required by the Copyright Act. The court holds that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DT was sufficiently in control of its artistic contribution to qualify as a joint author.

In contrast, the California trade secret claim is affirmed, as the court finds that DT did not make affirmative efforts to maintain the secrecy of its prototype. The court also affirms the denial of attorneys' fees, as the district court did not clearly err or abuse its discretion in denying EA an attorneys' fee award.

In conclusion, the court reverses the district court's grant of summary judgment on the copyright claim and remands for further proceedings. The court affirms the district court's grant of summary judgment on the trade secret claim and affirms the denial of attorneys' fees. The case is remanded for further proceedings, and each party shall bear its own costs on appeal. (Refs: 345 F.3d 1140, 207 F.3d 402)

(stating that the differences between a guitar based on Prince's symbol and Prince’s symbol may be "nothing more than the functional difference between a two-dimensional symbol and a guitar in the shape of that symbol,” but also positing that perhaps “the juxtaposition of the symbol and the guitar is enough to confer on the ensemble sufficient originality” for copyright protection).
