I've reviewed the reference cases provided, specifically 495 F.2d 221 and 52 F.2d 831, and I'll address the legal issues presented. The first case, 495 F.2d 221, discusses the importance of allegations of jurisdiction in a federal court. The court emphasizes that allegations of jurisdiction must appear affirmatively in the pleadings and that the burden of demonstrating clearly that there is no genuine issue of fact lies with the movant. This is particularly relevant in the context of the current motion for summary judgment.

Regarding the motion for summary judgment, I agree with the court's decision to deny it. The court correctly notes that a genuine issue of fact remains as to the height of the truck involved in the accident. The plaintiff's reliance on res ipsa loquitur to establish negligence is also a valid concern, as the doctrine cannot be applied unless there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact controlling its application.

The second case, 52 F.2d 831, is also relevant in the context of the current motion. The court's discussion of the burden of demonstrating clearly that there is no genuine issue of fact is particularly noteworthy. In this case, the movant has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of fact as to the height of the truck, but the court finds that this burden has not been met.

In conclusion, I agree with the court's decision to deny the motion for summary judgment. The court's analysis of the burden of demonstrating clearly that there is no genuine issue of fact is well-reasoned, and the court's finding that a genuine issue of fact remains as to the height of the truck is supported by the evidence. <answer>

gold_text: The factual affidavit supporting the third-party defendant’s motion for an additional postponement of trial herein reflects that its counsel has plans to participate in “a year’s end office meeting” in a state far removed from this district which offers attraction as a resort area. The action of a trial judge in refusing a requested continuance on the ground that a trial counsel had withdrawn his assistance was approved. Sanden v. Mayo Clinic, C.A.8th (1974), 495 F.2d 221, 227[2]. The same rule of discretion obtains where a continuance was claimed because of the death of a party’s counsel. Hunter v. Fairfax’s Devisee (1796), 3 U.S. (Dali) 305, 1 L.Ed. 613. And, it also applies where a party’s representative was ill. Speers Sand & Clay Works v. American Trust Co., C.C.A.4th (1931), 52 F.2d 831, 832-833[2], certiorari denied (1932), 286 U.S. 548, 52 S.Ct. 500, 76 L.Ed. 1284.
