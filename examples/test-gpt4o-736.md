This interpretation aligns with the Supreme Court's reasoning in the landmark case of Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U.S. 585 (1991). The Court emphasized that forum-selection clauses, particularly those in form passage contracts, are generally enforceable unless the opposing party can prove fundamental unfairness or fraud. In Marin's case, there is no indication that Xerox included the forum clause to discourage legitimate claims or that it obtained the plaintiff’s agreement through fraud.

Further supporting this position, the decision in Rodriguez v. PepsiCo Long Term Disability Plan, 926 F.2d 116 (1991), reinforces that arbitration agreements and forum-selection clauses in ERISA plans are not inconsistent with ERISA's legislative intent. The Ninth Circuit in Rodriguez held that nothing in ERISA's text or legislative history suggests an intent to foreclose such clauses, emphasizing that they do not undermine the statute’s goal of providing ready access to federal courts.

Given these precedents and the provided forum-selection clauses in the updated plan, the motion to transfer is granted. Consequently, this matter will be transferred to the Western District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a).

IT IS SO ORDERED.

M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407, U.S. 1, 15, 92 S.Ct. 1907, 32 L.Ed.2d 513 (1972); Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U.S. 585, 593-94, 111 S.Ct. 1522, 113 L.Ed.2d 622 (1991) (finding venue selection clauses to be binding even if the contract in question was not negotiated). In Laasko, a district court in the Central District of California found that the specific forum selection clause at issue in this case was not fundamentally unfair and did not contravene public policy. 566 F.Supp.2d at 1023-24. In fact, the court stated “enforcement of the forum selection clause in this case actually advances one of the purposes of ERISA by ‘bringing a measure of uniformity in an area where decisions under the same set of facts may differ from state to state.’ ” Id. at 122 (citing Bird v. Shearson Lehman/American Express, Inc., 926 F.2d 116, 122 (2d Cir.1991)). This district has similarly found that “limiting claims to one federal district encourages uniformity in the decisions interpreting that plan, which furthers ERISA’s goal of enabling employers to establish a uniform administrative scheme” Rodriguez, 716 F.Supp.2d at 861 (internal citations omitted).
