In this case, the question is whether Halpern is a prevailing party under the Equal Access to Justice Act ("EAJA"). The Veterans' Court concluded that Halpern was not a prevailing party because the remand was solely due to a change in case law during the pendency of the appeal. However, Halpern argues that the Veterans' Court erred in its application of the law.

As mentioned in Reference Case 351 F.3d 1381, the Supreme Court has set a high threshold for a party to achieve prevailing party status. In order to be a prevailing party, a party must receive at least some relief on the merits of their claim. In this case, the Veterans' Court remanded the case to the Board with directions to dismiss, but the Court did not retain jurisdiction.

Reference Case 371 F.3d 1362 states that when there is a remand to the agency which grants relief on the merits sought by the plaintiff, and the trial court does not retain jurisdiction, the securing of the remand order is itself success on the merits. However, in this case, the remand was solely due to a change in case law during the pendency of the appeal, and the Veterans' Court did not grant relief on the merits sought by Halpern.

Accordingly, we conclude that Halpern is not a prevailing party under EAJA. The Veterans' Court correctly applied the law in this case, and the remand was solely due to a change in case law during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, we affirm the decision of the Veterans' Court denying Halpern's EAJA application. <answer>

gold_text: Our jurisdiction in veterans cases is limited by statute. See 38 U.S.C. § 7292(d)(2) (2000). We have recognized, however, that where adoption of a particular legal standard dictates the outcome of a case based on undisputed facts, we may address that issue as a question of law. Brandenburg v. Principi, 371 F.3d 1362, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2004); Bailey v. Principi, 351 F.3d 1381, 1384 (Fed.Cir.2003) (“[W]hen the material facts are not in dispute and the adoption of a particular legal standard would dictate the outcome of the equitable tolling claim, this court has treated the question of the availability of equitable tolling as a matter of law that we are authorized by statute to address”). Given the standards for prevailing party status articulated above, the undisputed facts in this case dictate the outcome.
