In reviewing the legal cases, we must consider the principles of reasonableness and plain error. As stated in United States v. Talley, 431 F.3d 784, when evaluating a sentence for reasonableness, we must recognize that there is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose, and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.

In the case at hand, the district court did not err in imposing a 364-month sentence on Quang Van Nguyen for conspiracy to possess methamphetamine with intent to distribute. The evidence was sufficient to show that Nguyen conspired to distribute methamphetamine, and the jury was free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.

Moreover, the district court did not plainly err by failing to give a jury instruction on the buyer-seller relationship, as stated in United States v. Lively, 803 F.2d 1124. The conspiracy instruction adequately addressed the substance of the requested instruction and covered the buyer-seller relationship.

Additionally, the district court did not err in using facts found by a judge and not by the jury in determining Nguyen's sentence. Nguyen admitted to the facts in the pre-sentence investigation report used to calculate his sentence, and district courts are permitted to find facts by a preponderance of the evidence to use in calculating the advisory guideline range.

Finally, the district court imposed a procedurally and substantively reasonable sentence, taking into account the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors. The sentence was not abusive of the district court's discretion, and we find no error in the sentence imposed.

In conclusion, the district court's sentence was reasonable and did not violate Nguyen's Sixth Amendment rights. The court's use of facts found by a judge and not by the jury in determining Nguyen's sentence was proper, and the court's calculation of the drug quantity failed to consider the effect of a long distribution period on the quantity of drugs. We affirm the district court's sentence.
