In analyzing the validity of the refusal by the Treasury Department and the Civil Service Commission to grant the plaintiff's retirement benefits, it is essential to understand the scope of discretionary power as established by precedent. As the Supreme Court elucidated in a reference case, "whenever a statute gives a discretionary power to any person, to be exercised by him, upon his own opinion of certain facts, it is a sound rule of construction, that the statute constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of those facts" (310 U.S. 371). This principle was reaffirmed where the judgment of an officer exercising such discretion was deemed not subject to review (60 S. Ct. 944).

The facts reveal that the Treasury Department's refusal to recommend and the Civil Service Commission's subsequent disapproval were based on a classification distinguishing between special agents and revenue agents attached to the Fraud Unit. Despite some overlap in duties, such as investigatory tasks, the distinction held that special agents perform roles warranting the classification for early retirement benefits, whereas those in the Fraud Unit did not. The plaintiff did not demonstrate exposure to greater hazards than those typically associated with his group, thus failing to meet the specified statutory criteria.

Therefore, the classification applied by the Treasury Department and Civil Service Commission does not exhibit the arbitrariness that would necessitate judicial intervention. The court, while acknowledging the plaintiffâ€™s long-standing service, must defer to the administrative discretion explicitly entrusted by Congress under the governing statute.
