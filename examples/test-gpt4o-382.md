The government argues that the contributions to the Plan do not qualify as “ordinary and necessary expenses” under section 23(a) (1) (A), as established in Botany Worsted Mills v. United States, 278 U.S. 282. In particular, it draws on the findings of both Reference cases 138 Ct. Cl. 1 and 149 F. Supp. 889, where payments to employees were determined to lack a substantial relation to the measure of their services and were found to be disproportional. The tax code seeks to prevent deductions of any expenses that are deemed to be in excess of what is reasonable compensation. 

Here, the deduction's legitimacy hinges on whether the amounts accrued to the Plan were commensurate with the dealers' contributions. Despite the Plan’s nondiscriminatory and performance-based approach, any portion of the accrued amounts not reasonably reflecting actual services would be inconsistent with the principles affirmed in the cited cases. Thus, the correctness of these deductions must align strictly with the precedent, making clear that only duly evidenced reasonable compensations are deductible.

Therefore, while the Plaintiff's Plan aligns with the necessity of maintaining dealer loyalty, scrutiny under the mentioned precedents requires a closer evaluation of each year’s accrued amount to ensure they pass the test of reasonableness.

gold_text: Because we have premised the deduction of the amounts accrued to the Plan on our finding that this deduction is justified under section 173, we need not reach the question whether plaintiff would also be entitled to this deduction under section 162, although no attempt has been made to show that as to any one dealer, the amount he may receive under the Fund (including his share of “forfeitures”) is “reasonable.” Cf.
