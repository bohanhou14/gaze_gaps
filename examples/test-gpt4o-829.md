ORDER
DAUGHERTY, Chief Judge.
This is an action to recover for the wrongful death of Plaintiff Tennie L. Gilbreath’s (Gilbreath) husband caused from burns he allegedly received when the ditching machine he was operating struck Defendant’s pressurized natural gas pipeline resulting in an explosion and fire. Plaintiff Western Casualty and Surety Company (Western) was made a party plaintiff to this action on motion of the Defendant as Western has paid worker’s compensation benefits to Plaintiff Gilbreath and is thereby subrogated to all or part of Plaintiff Gilbreath’s claim against Defendant pursuant to 85 Okl.Stat.Supp. 1979 § 44(a). It is asserted that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332 by reason of diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy.
Plaintiff Gilbreath has filed herein, by leave of the Court, her “Third Amended Complaint.” Defendant has responded by way of answer and a Motion to Strike paragraphs 12 and 10(c) of said Third Amended Complaint, pursuant to Rule 12(f), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Said Motion is supported by Briefs. Plaintiffs have filed a response Brief in opposition to the Motion.

Rule 12(f), supra, provides that the Court may order stricken from any pleading any redundant or immaterial matter. However, motions to strike are not favored and are strictly construed. Vinita Broadcasting Co. v. Colby, 320 F.Supp. 902 (N.D.Okl. 1971). Any doubt as to the striking of a matter in a pleading should be resolved in favor of the pleading. Hanley v. Volpe, 305 F.Supp. 977 (D.C. Wis. 1969).

Defendant’s reliance on striking Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages mirrors the contention discussed in 56 F.R.D. 116, where improper labeling of defenses was addressed. Courts have consistently allowed punitive damages as part of a general claim for damages, provided the proof supports such recovery (White v. B. K. Trucking, Inc., 371 F.Supp. 578 (W.D. Okl. 1974)).

Further, Defendant’s contention regarding Plaintiff’s allegations about special precautions can be analogously considered under the standards outlined in 69 F.R.D. 1, where the court examined the context-specific nature of duties and facts determined by a jury.

In view of the foregoing, it appears to the Court that Defendant has not made a clear showing that the material in Plaintiff’s Third Amended Complaint it wishes to be stricken should be. Accordingly,
