The cases mentioned, 434 U.S. 497, 372 U.S. 734, and 596 F.2d 76, all deal with the concept of double jeopardy and the rights of a defendant in a criminal trial. In the case of 434 U.S. 497, the Supreme Court held that a defendant cannot be retried for a crime after a mistrial has been declared, unless there is a showing of "manifest necessity" for the mistrial. The court also noted that a defendant's rights against double jeopardy are protected by the Fifth Amendment and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution.

In the case of 372 U.S. 734, the Supreme Court held that a defendant cannot be retried for a crime after a trial has been terminated due to a hung jury, unless there is a showing of "manifest necessity" for the mistrial. The court also noted that a defendant's rights against double jeopardy are protected by the Fifth Amendment and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution.

In the case of 596 F.2d 76, the court held that a defendant cannot be retried for a crime after a mistrial has been declared, unless there is a showing of "manifest necessity" for the mistrial. The court also noted that a defendant's rights against double jeopardy are protected by the Fifth Amendment and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution.

In the context of the present case, the court must consider whether the defendant's rights against double jeopardy have been violated. The court must also consider whether there was a showing of "manifest necessity" for the mistrial. If the court determines that the defendant's rights against double jeopardy have been violated, it may grant the defendant's motion to dismiss the charges and prevent further prosecution.

In conclusion, the cases of 434 U.S. 497, 372 U.S. 734, and 596 F.2d 76 all deal with the concept of double jeopardy and the rights of a defendant in a criminal trial. The court must consider whether the defendant's rights against double jeopardy have been violated and whether there was a showing of "manifest necessity" for the mistrial in order to determine whether the defendant's motion to dismiss the charges should be granted. <answer>

gold_text: Having concluded that directing judgments of acquittal would have been improper, the court is of the view that the instant motions boil down to objections to the simple situation of second trials following hung juries. Viewed as such, these cases are squarely governed by the long-established rule that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a second trial following the declaration of a mistrial due to “manifest necessity”, United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824); United States v. DiFrancesco,-U.S.-,-, 101 S.Ct. 426, 433, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980); Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 509-10, 98 S.Ct. 824, 832-33, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978), “[t]he classic example [of which] is a mistrial because the jury is unable to agree. U. S. v. Perez, supra.” Downum v. United States, 372 U.S. 734, 736, 83 S.Ct. 1033, 1034, 10 L.Ed.2d 100 (1962). Since there is no claim on these motions of any abuse of discretion in the declaration of a mistrial on the sixth day of fruitless deliberations, the court is of opinion that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment presents no bar to the trials of these defendants on these three indictments. Arizona v. Washington, supra; United States v. MacQueen, 596 F.2d 76, 82 (2d Cir. 1979). Accordingly, the motions are denied.
