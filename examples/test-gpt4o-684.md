In holding that custom-made seat covers are subject to the federal excise tax, it is essential to examine the precedent set forth in related cases. In United States v. Keeton, 4 Cir., 238 F.2d 878, the court rejected the contention that producing items for immediate use exempted the taxpayer from the excise tax. Similarly, the decision in 14 F.2d 857, where the court differentiated between contracts for sale and those for work and materials, reinforces that manufacturing custom-made items does not exclude them from taxation.

Furthermore, in the context of nonresident foreign corporations holding American securities, as noted in 137 F.2d 731, the key factor was whether the corporation was engaged in business within the U.S. Here, the focus is on the definition of "manufacturer" and "parts or accessories" per the statutory language. The taxpayer's operations involve both processing and assembling new materials into a commodity defined under § 316.4 of Treasury Regulation 46, aligning with the statutory definition seen in similar contexts.

Thus, consistent with the statutory interpretation and administrative rulings referenced, we affirm that the custom-made seat covers fall within the taxable category of "parts or accessories" and that appellant is the manufacturer under the terms of the applicable legislation.

In applying section 3403(c) its language must be accorded reasonable scope, including different types of manufacturing. The tax must not be so narrowly applied as to leave beyond its reach activities which are fairly within the intendment and language of the statute. There is no ‘clear-cut reason for limiting the apparent generality of the statutory term[s] involved.’ Fides, A. G. v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 137 F.2d 731, 734.
