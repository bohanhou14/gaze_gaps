**Generation:**

3.23 The Court also acknowledges the Debtorâ€™s argument that the mere lack of a plan does not automatically warrant lifting the stay. However, as established in In re Greiman, 45 B.R. 574, 579 (Bankr.N.D.Iowa 1984), the burden lies with the Debtor to demonstrate that the property is indeed necessary for an effective reorganization. In this case, the Debtor failed to provide sufficient credible evidence to meet this burden.

3.24 Furthermore, it is worth noting that in similar cases, courts have determined that the burden is on the debtor to present a viable plan rather than relying on the argument that the creditor has not provided an alternative (In re BBT, 11 B.R. 224, 230 (Bkrtcy.Nev.1981)). In that precedent, the argument that a creditor might do no more than the debtor with the property was not sufficient to justify the debtor retaining the property.

3.25 Hence, this Court cannot justify extending the stay purely based on speculative assertions that the property could potentially contribute to a future reorganization. The standards set forth in the cited cases reinforce the necessity for concrete and well-supported plans. Without such evidence, granting the stay would counteract the purpose of Section 362(d) designed to balance the interests of creditors and debtors effectively.

Given the lack of substantive proof from the Debtor and the compelling evidence presented by the Movant, the motion for relief from the automatic stay must be granted.

gold_text: 3.23 The Debtor in this case has also at least alluded to the idea that the Movant cannot do more with the subject properties than is now being done or attempted to be done by the Debtor. This Court is not aware of any requirement that the creditor explain what it intends to do with the property if it is successful in vacating the stay. The mere fact that a secured creditor would do nothing more than Debtor with the property does not mean Debtor should be allowed to keep the property. In re Greiman, 45 B.R. 574, 583 (Bankr.N.D. Iowa 1984), citing In re BBT, 11 B.R. 224, 230 (Bankr.Nev.1981).
