The issue of whether the corporate veil should be pierced is a determination of the property attributes of stock ownership and of the relationship between a stockholder/director and his corporation. This determination is made by application of state, not federal law, as stated in Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d 136 (1979). In this case, the law of Texas applies, as stated in Restatement of Conflicts of Law 2d § 307, Comment a.

In determining whether the corporate veil should be pierced, courts consider factors such as control, use of corporate funds, and family relationships. Shades Ridge Holding Co., Inc. v. United States, 888 F.2d 725 (11th Cir.1989). However, the alter ego/instrumentality doctrine in Florida requires a showing of improper conduct before the corporate veil can be pierced, as stated in Dania Jai-Alai Palace, Inc. v. Sykes, 450 So.2d 1114 (Fla.1984). The court must find that the corporation was organized or used to mislead creditors or to perpetrate a fraud upon them.

In Hillsborough Holdings Corp. v. The Celotex Corp. (In re Hillsborough Holdings Corp.), 166 B.R. 461, 468 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1994), the court listed three factors that must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence to pierce the corporate veil: (1) the shareholder dominated and controlled the corporation to such an extent that the corporation’s independent existence was in fact non-existent and the shareholders were in fact alter egos of the corporation; (2) the corporate form must have been used fraudulently or for an improper purpose; and (3) the fraudulent or improper use of the corporate form caused injury to the claimant.

In conclusion, the determination of whether the corporate veil should be pierced is a determination of the property attributes of stock ownership and of the relationship between a stockholder/director and his corporation. In this case, the law of Texas applies, and the corporate veil can only be pierced if a showing of improper conduct is made. The court must find that the corporation was organized or used to mislead creditors or to perpetrate a fraud upon them, and the shareholder must have dominated and controlled the corporation to such
