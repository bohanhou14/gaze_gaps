In the context of legal cases, vagueness is a crucial aspect that can lead to arbitrary and discriminatory application of laws. In the reference case 455 U.S. 489, the Supreme Court held that a drug paraphernalia ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague, as it provided a clear standard of conduct for businesses to follow. The Court noted that the ordinance was not vague because it was "transparently clear" that certain conduct was restricted.

In a similar vein, the reference case 969 F.2d 652 dealt with a challenge to the constitutionality of a drug trafficking statute. The Court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, as it provided a clear definition of the term "cocaine base." The Court noted that the term "cocaine base" was not ambiguous, and that the statute provided a clear standard of conduct for individuals to follow.

In the present case, the defendant argues that the term "cocaine base" is unconstitutionally vague, as it has been subject to conflicting judicial definitions. However, the Court finds that the term is not vague, as it provides a clear standard of conduct for individuals to follow. The Court notes that the definition of "cocaine base" is not ambiguous, and that the statute provides a clear standard of conduct for individuals to follow.

In conclusion, the Court finds that the term "cocaine base" is not unconstitutionally vague, as it provides a clear standard of conduct for individuals to follow. The Court relies on the reference cases 455 U.S. 489 and 969 F.2d 652 to support its conclusion. The defendant's argument that the term is unconstitutionally vague is without merit, and the Court affirms the judgment of the lower court.

Posters ‘N’ Things Ltd, 969 F.2d 652 (8th Cir.1992), this court held that 21 U.S.C. § 857, which prohibits the sale of drug paraphernalia, is not unconstitutionally vague on its face or as applied. In Village of Hoffman Estates the Supreme Court rejected a facial vagueness challenge to a city ordinance that regulated drug paraphernalia, because the ordinance was "sufficiently clear as applied.” 455 U.S. at 500, 102 S.Ct. at 1194. We note that in Village of Hoffman Estates, the Supreme Court stated that "[a] plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.” Id. at 495, 102 S.Ct. at 1191.
