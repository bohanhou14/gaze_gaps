The train of events presented in this case is similar to those in Emanuel N. (Manny) Kolkey, 27 T.C. 37 (1956), and Clay B. Brown, 37 T.C. 461 (1961). In Kolkey, we found that there was no real sale, whereas in Brown, we agreed that the sales were bona fide, giving rise to capital gains for the sellers. The current case, however, deals with the tax treatment of the lessee corporation's rental payments.

The evidence presented suggests that Weiser #1 was transferred to Foundation for $990,000, later reduced to $940,000, almost double its fair market value at the time. Foundation then liquidated Weiser #1 and sold or leased its assets to Weiser #2. The rent called for in the lease was a reasonable rent for the property subject to the lease.

In contrast to cases like Brown and Royal Farms, where the sales were bona fide, the circumstances of this case are suspicious. The high ratio of sales price to fair market value of the business, combined with the transfer of substantially all of the business assets to Russell's corporation 5 years after their purchase, suggests that a facade was created. Furthermore, the substantial debts owed by Weiser #2 to Russell, his wholly owned corporations, and the other stockholders, as well as the relationship between the rental rates and the amounts Foundation was required to pay the sellers, also raise suspicions.

In conclusion, we agree with respondent's conclusion that the payments made by Weiser #2 under its lease from Foundation were in substance the distribution of business earnings and profits before these earnings and profits were properly taxed. This is similar to the conclusion reached in 12 T.C. 539, where it was found that the corporation's alleged rental payments to the partnership were in fact distributions of corporate earnings in the nature of cash dividends. Similarly, in 27 T.C. 413, the court disallowed deductions for alleged expenses, finding that they were not ordinary and necessary business expenses. In this case, we find that Weiser #2's rental payments to Foundation were not a reasonable rental, but rather a distribution of business earnings and profits.

gold_text: We recognize that this record is far less favorable to respondent than that we met in Kolhey. Nevertheless, we conclude that petitioner has failed to sustain his burden of proving that the transactions entered into had the real effect of separating equity in the business assets from use of the business assets. Accordingly, we cannot say that Weiser #2 was required to pay these amounts or any amounts for the use of property in which it has no equity. See Catherine G. Armston, 12 T.C. 539 (1949), affd. 188 F. 2d 531 (C.A. 5, 1951); R.E.L. Finley, 27 T.C. 413 (1956), affd. 255 F. 2d 128 (C.A. 10, 1958).
