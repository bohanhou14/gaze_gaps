The provisions of the Chandler Act and their interpretation have been pivotal in the present case. The rulings such as in *Dickinson Industrial Site Inc. v. Cowan, 308 U.S. 371*, illustrate that discretionary appeals must adhere strictly to procedural mandates. Pertinently, this court examined whether the appellants satisfied section 250 requirements. Appellants failed to apply for appeal leave within the prescribed period, directly linking to the procedural flaw identified in *Shulman v. Wilson-Sheridan Hotel Co., 301 U.S. 174*, where appeals concerning attorney fees required precise adherence to section 24, sub. b. Similarly, the necessity for a meticulous approach in filing appears in discussions about the distinct classes of financial statements under scrutiny in *In re Foster Construction Corp., 271 U.S. 176*. Furthermore, observing the distinction between representational classes of financial statements encountered in *Irving National Bank case, 279 F. 372*, underscores procedural diligence imperative in judicial processes.

Thus, reflecting upon *Shoreland Co. v. Conklin, 49 F.2d 489*, and the overarching consistency maintained through judicial precedents, this court concurs that jurisdictional thresholds were not met. Consequently, the appeals must be dismissed.

gold_text: The other arguments advanced in opposition to granting the motions at bar will not withstand scrutiny: (a) The recent decision of the Supreme Court in Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U.S. 371, 60 S.Ct. 317, 84 L.Ed. -, deals with the subject of collateral attack upon a judgment of an appellate court; it has nothing to do with the problem at bar, where our jurisdiction is attacked directly, (b) Arguments based on Taylor v. Voss, 271 U.S. 176, 46 S.Ct. 461, 70 L.Ed. 889, and similar cases, are not persuasive that an appeal as of right will serve as an application to the appellate court for leave to appeal. Cf. In re Kenmore Granville Hotel Co., 7 Cir., 90 F.2d 151, 152. The statute construed in the Taylor case contained no provision that petitions to revise were to be allowed in the discretion of the appellate court. It was apparently the practice to file petitions to revise in the circuit court of appeals, but we have found nothing to indicate that any order granting leave to file the petition was required. See In re B. & R. Glove Corp., 2 Cir., 279 F. 372, 374; Rule 16 of this court, printed in Collier, Bankruptcy, 13th ed. p. 2984. (c) The argument that the motion for leave to consolidate the appeals was equivalent to a motion for leave to appeal belies the facts. The appellants did not seek to have us al low the appeals, for they believed it unnecessary in view of our London decision; and in granting the motion we exercised no discretion with respect to allowance of the appeals for the same reason, (d) To protect the appellants merely because they were misled by our erroneous construction of the statute, now overruled by the Supreme Court, would require us to go contrary to elementary principles governing appellate jurisdiction. See Alaska Packers v. Pillsbury, 301 U.S. 174, 57 S.Ct. 682, 81 L.Ed. 988.
