In the context of legal cases, a motion to withdraw a guilty plea may be denied without a hearing where the defendant's allegations "merely contradict the record," are "inherently incredible," or are "simply conclusory." (United States v. O'Hara, 960 F.2d 11, 14 (2d Cir.1992), citing United States v. Grúllon, 129 F.3d 710 (2d Cir.1997). In United States v. Gonzalez, 970 F.2d 1095 (2d Cir.1992), the court held that a defendant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing as a matter of right whenever he seeks to withdraw his guilty plea.

In the case at hand, the defendant, Matvia, has failed to meet his burden of establishing valid grounds for withdrawal and has not shown any fair and just reasons for withdrawal of the plea. Matvia has made conclusory statements without factual support and has failed to assert his innocence in any meaningful way. The court's analysis accords with our jurisprudence, citing United States v. Brown, 250 F.3d 811, 815 (3d Cir.2001), and United States v. Huff, 873 F.2d 709, 712 (3d Cir.1989).

The court has carefully reviewed the transcript of the plea hearing and has found that Matvia admitted making the charged threat and has not shown any impairment in his ability to understand the proceedings or to make a knowing and voluntary plea. The court has also considered the report of Dr. Wettstein, a psychiatrist who had examined Matvia and found him competent. All of this evidence supports the court's decision to deny the motion to withdraw the guilty plea.

In conclusion, the court's decision to deny Matvia's motion to withdraw his guilty plea is affirmed. The court's analysis is in line with the precedents established in United States v. O'Hara, 960 F.2d 11, 14 (2d Cir.1992), and United States v. Gonzalez, 970 F.2d 1095 (2d Cir.1992), which hold that a motion to withdraw a guilty plea may be denied without a hearing where the defendant's allegations are merely conclusory or lack factual support. The court's decision is also supported by the evidence presented in the transcript

gold_text: Indeed, “[a] motion to withdraw a guilty plea may be denied without a hearing where the defendant’s allegations ‘merely contradict the record,’ are ‘inherently incredible,’ or are ‘simply conelusory.’ ” United States v. Torres, 129 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir.1992) (quoting United States v. Gonzalez, 970 F.2d 1095, 1100 (2d Cir.1992)). As found before at the ex parte hearing, the court now finds that defendant’s allegations are simply conelusory statements that contradict the record. Thus, there is no need to hold another hearing on the matter of Sims’s alleged ineffectiveness because it would be needlessly duplicative and wasteful of judicial resources.
