In the context of the legal cases provided, it is essential to consider the principles of due process and the role of counsel in a court-martial proceeding. In Reference case 133 F.2d 528, the court held that a court-martial counsel, chosen by the litigant and accepted by the court, is the same kind of officer at the bar of that court as one entitled to practice at the bar of any other court.

In Reference case 153 F.2d 834, the court established that recitals in the judgment record going to the jurisdiction of the court, such as that a defendant was represented by counsel, are impervious to attack by testimony in the absence of an allegation of fraud.

In Reference case 148 F.2d 667, the court emphasized that the alleged offense occurred about the middle of December 1945, and the defendants were held in custody in a stockade from about December 15, 1945, until the 8th day of May 1946. The court-martial trial was conducted before the court-martial, and the defendants were convicted of violating the 94th Article of War.

In this case, the petitioners argued that they were deprived of their liberty in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States, and particularly, they were denied the Due Process of law contemplated by Amendment V. However, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction, and the trial was conducted in compliance with the rules of the court-martial.

Additionally, the court rejected the petitioners' argument that their counsel was ineffective, citing the principles established in Reference case 133 F.2d 528. The court emphasized that the assistance of counsel is desirable, but not always readily available, and that Congress provided for the appointment of defense counsel in Article 11, Title 10 U.S.C.A. § 1482.

In conclusion, the court's decision was based on the principles of due process, the role of counsel in a court-martial proceeding, and the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. The court's ruling was consistent with the principles established in the reference cases, and it emphasized the importance of complying with the rules of the court-martial.

gold_text: But regardless of what has been suggested or said, this court shares the view stated by the Circuit Court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Romero v. Squier, 133 F.2d 528, 531, 532 that an Army officer, admitted by a court-martial to practice the arts of a military defense, need not also be admitted to practice by some civil court and, when chosen by the litigant and accepted by the court-martial “to prosecute or defend litigation there, is the same kind of officer at the bar of that court as is one entitled to practice at the bar of any other court.” Moreover, the court record imports absolute verity, Thomas v. Hunter, 10 Cir., 153 F.2d 834; and it shows that these petitioners voluntarily elected to have Lt. Stout defend them. They were therefore bound by his acts and agreements, however inept, since no fraud, collusioh or corruption by him has either been alleged or proved. Cf. Altmayer v. Sanford, 5 Cir., 148 F.2d 161; Diggs v. Welch, 80 U.S. App.D.C. 5, 148 F.2d 667, 670. Whether he did, or failed to do, something which petitioners and learned counsel presently representing them think was improper or unwise is beside the point. As Judge Murrah of this (the Tenth) Circuit recently said, speaking for the court in Moss v. Hunter, 167 F.2d 683, 684, certiorari denied June 21, 1948, 334 U.S. 860, 68 S.Ct. 1519, 92 L.Ed. 1780:
