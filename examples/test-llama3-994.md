In the case of Phillips v. Brewer, the court held that the imposition of no-contact visitation upon inmates who have been found guilty of possessing a controlled substance does not violate due process. The court found that the policy was reasonably related to the legitimate government objective of preventing the introduction of contraband drugs into the prison. The court also held that the procedures did not run afoul of any liberty interests under the guidelines of Block v. Rutherford, 104 S.Ct. 3227 (1984).

In the case of Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983), the Supreme Court held that State laws or regulations expressed in mandatory language may create a liberty interest subject to due process protections. However, in this case, the court found that the Iowa Code and Administrative Code did not create a liberty interest in contact visitation.

The court also considered the issue of qualified immunity, citing Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967), which states that a public official who acts in good faith may be entitled to immunity from liability. The court held that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because they acted in good faith and in accordance with the law.

In conclusion, the court held that the no-contact visitation policy did not violate due process and that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The court's decision is consistent with the guidelines set forth in Block v. Rutherford and Pierson v. Ray.

gold_text: A public official is entitled to qualified or good faith immunity unless the official knew or reasonably should have known that his action would violate the constitutional rights of the plaintiff or if he took the action with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 815, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2736, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). See also Wycoff v. Brewer, 572 F.2d 1260, 1267 (8th Cir.1978); Ervin v. Ciccone, 557 F.2d 1260, 1262 (8th Cir.1977). In determining the reasonableness of an officialâ€™s belief that an action was constitutional, the court should look to whether the action violated a well-settled and unquestioned constitutional right.
