This case is a habeas corpus petition filed by Roy Bruce Smith, who was convicted of murdering Manassas Police Sergeant John Conner. Smith argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for not seeking the appointment of non-psychiatric experts to testify at trial. The Supreme Court has held in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), that a defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.

In this case, Smith's trial counsel cross-examined the prosecution's experts, including Dr. Frances Field, Julien Mason, and Donald McClanrock, to challenge their theories. Smith's counsel also presented expert testimony at the habeas hearing, including that of Gary Laughlin, Stewart James, Dr. Vincent DiMaio, and Lucien Haag. However, the court found that Smith's trial counsel's performance was not constitutionally deficient, as they reasonably chose to rely on cross-examination of the State's own witnesses to establish their case.

The court also denied Smith's claim of ineffective assistance of state habeas counsel, citing Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722 (1991), which held that there is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings. Therefore, Smith's state habeas counsel's errors could not be considered "cause" for procedural default.

Furthermore, the court denied Smith's motion to amend his habeas petition, citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962), which held that leave to amend should be freely given when justice so requires. However, the court found that Smith's delay in uncovering the evidence was unreasonable and that the delay to the State was "inordinately prejudicial." In conclusion, Smith's habeas petition was denied, and his convictions and sentence were affirmed.
