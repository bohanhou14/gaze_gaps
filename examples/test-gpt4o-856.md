In addressing the Ebelings' concerns on infringement and invalidity, we draw parallels with several reference cases to fortify our analysis. The principle that credibility determinations of expert witnesses and factual findings by a jury must be respected was underscored in Swofford v. B & W, Inc., 395 F.2d 362. Moreover, the court's discretion concerning the qualification of expert witnesses and the jury's resolution of factual questions regarding patent validity, as outlined in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, dictates our approach to the present case.

Additionally, the necessity of substantial evidence to support jury findings on patent claims is echoed in Control Components, Inc. v. Valtek, Inc., 609 F.2d 763, 766-67, where adherence to factual inquiries informed the legal determination of obviousness. This parallel aligns with the district court's independent finding that claims 11 and 12 were obvious, supported by substantial evidence of prior art, including the Oliver and Bowman-Shaw patents.

Furthermore, the determination that a patent is invalid if it was obvious at the time, as referenced in Cathodic Protection Service v. American Safety, 594 F.2d 499, and the rigorous scrutiny of expert testimony, maintains the heavy burden of proving non-obviousness and the presumption of patent validity under 35 U.S.C. § 103.

Consequently, the substantial evidence standard and the jury's purview over credibility and factual determinations were pivotal in affirming the district court’s decision, consistent with the rationale in Garrett v. American Safety, 502 F.2d 9. The challenges raised by the Ebelings do not demonstrate a clear abuse of discretion or a misapplication of law.

Therefore, the judgment is reaffirmed, honoring the substantial evidence presented and the proper application of legal standards in evaluating patent claims' obviousness and infringement.
