In cases where supplemental jurisdiction is at issue, the court must weigh considerations such as judicial economy, convenience, and fairness to the litigants. According to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c), exercising supplemental jurisdiction is within the discretion of the district court, particularly when the federal claims have been dismissed. The Tenth Circuit has recognized the seminal teaching of United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, wherein it is often appropriate to dismiss state claims when federal claims are resolved pretrial (383 U.S. 715, 726). Additionally, this is reinforced in 124 F.3d 1221, which emphasizes that the dismissal of federal claims generally leads to the dismissal of associated state claims without prejudice.

Considering the dismissal of plaintiff’s federal claims and the primary focus on the state law retaliatory termination claim, it is prudent to decline supplemental jurisdiction. This is consistent with the principle to avoid needless decisions of state law to uphold comity and ensure justice (383 U.S. 715). Furthermore, the potential for jury confusion and divergence in legal theories suggests it is suitable to separate the state and federal claims for resolution (124 F.3d 1221).

Therefore, the plaintiff’s state law claim of retaliatory termination should be dismissed without prejudice, allowing it to be addressed in a more appropriate state tribunal.

Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 725-26, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966) (“[I]f the federal claims are dismissed before trial, ... the state claims should be dismissed as well.”). When the federal claims have dropped from the case, the seminal teaching of Gibbs is that the most common response is to dismiss the state law claims without prejudice. Roe v. Cheyenne Mountain Conference Resort, Inc., 124 F.3d 1221, 1237 (10th Cir.1997). The parties do not argue any unique circumstances, and the court finds none, that would justify exercising supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs state law claims against the defendant.
