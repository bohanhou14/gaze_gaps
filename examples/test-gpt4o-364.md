III. Summary and Conclusion

In addressing the plaintiffs' claims pertaining to discriminatory practices and the alleged violation of their constitutional rights, it is imperative to contextualize the established legal precedents. As affirmed in Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, and Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, mere discriminatory impact is insufficient to establish a claim under the Equal Protection Clause; a discriminatory intent must be demonstrably proven. 

In the context of housing and proactive measures, the precedent set forth in Palmer v. Thompson, 500 F.2d 1078, underscores that a governmental body is not obligated to undertake affirmative actions unless explicitly required by statutory or constitutional mandates. The plaintiffs' assertion to impose on the defendants an obligation to construct housing based on racial preferences finds no grounding in constitutional requirements.

Moreover, the facial neutrality and self-selection nature of the Plan align with the principles upheld in Railway Mail Association v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, where discrimination based solely on race without broader regulatory considerations was negated. The Plan's framework supports voluntary engagement without compulsion, underscoring the non-violation of discriminatory practices.

Accordingly, the claims under Counts II, III, IV, and VI concerning Title VI, § 1983, and the Fourteenth Amendment fail for lack of both discriminatory intent and effect. No substantially discriminatory impact arises under Title VIII, given the Plan’s neutral application and voluntary basis.

Consequently, defendants’ motion for summary judgment with respect to the claims asserted under the Civil Rights Acts and constitutional violations is therefore granted.

gold_text: All of the housing developments in South Boston are “racially imbalanced”, defined as less than ten percent non-white. Consequently whites are not given the opportunity to act as “minority preference applicants” for BHA housing developments located in South Boston. This appears to be the gravamen of plaintiffs’ complaint. However, there is no federally protected right to housing in a particular community, an allegation which lies at the essence of plaintiffs’ action. Nor may plaintiffs attempt to keep members of another racial group from entering the community. Railway Mail Association v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, 65 S.Ct. 1483, 89 L.Ed. 2072 (1945). Plaintiffs are not prevented from obtaining all housing in the South Boston community as a result of the operation of the Plan. And clearly there is no federally protected right to low income public housing. Acevedo v. Nassau County, 500 F.2d 1078 (2d Cir. 1974). Discriminatory effect cannot be established with reference to a single community.
