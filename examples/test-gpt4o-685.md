In support of our reasoning, we turn to the case law that further elucidates the duty of reasonable diligence in securities fraud cases. In the case of List v. Fashion Park, Inc., the court stressed the importance of a plaintiff’s duty to conduct due diligence. The plaintiff in that case was not allowed to recover due to their failure to demonstrate the reasonable diligence expected of a sophisticated investor (361 F.2d 260). Similarly, in the matter of City National Bank of Fort Smith, Ark. v. Vanderboom, the court emphasized that a plaintiff's reliance on misrepresentations or nondisclosures must be deemed reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time (298 F. Supp. 66). This standard ensures that recovery is limited to those investors who act in good faith and with prudence in their transactions.

Furthermore, in Kohler v. Kohler Co., the court underscored that the plaintiff’s business acumen and familiarity with industry practices are critical factors when assessing their duty to investigate potential fraud (361 F.2d 260). The principle that not all investors are afforded protection when they fail to exercise requisite care is further solidified in this judgment.

Thus, we hold that the lower court did not err in instructing the jury on the plaintiff’s duty of reasonable diligence. Our decision aligns with the prevailing standards in securities fraud litigation and reinforces the necessity for investors to act with due care and vigilance.
