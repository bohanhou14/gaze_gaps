III. DISPOSITION OF THE PENDING CLAIMS

Given that all claims in this case are arbitrable, the Court may dismiss the action without prejudice rather than stay it. As established in 133 F.3d 141, a court has the discretion to dismiss the entire action when all issues before it are arbitrable. In Alford v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 975 F.2d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir.1992), the court noted that even when a district judge states claims are not waived, the determination to send them to arbitration remains unless overturned. This aligns with the position in 619 F.3d 67, emphasizing that the magistrate judge can send claims to arbitration if deemed appropriate and enforceable by the contract terms.

Accordingly, because the arbitration clause here is broad enough to encompass all the claims made by FJO, and there are no conflicting arguments against its enforceability, this Court determines that dismissal is appropriate. The motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the case without prejudice is hereby granted.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, MCI’s motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the case without prejudice is GRANTED. This case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 

IT IS SO ORDERED.

BESOSA, District Judge.

gold_text: The next issue is the proper disposition of the case. Pursuant' to Section 3 of the FAA, where the issues before a court are arbitrable, the court shall “stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement.” 9 U.S.C. § 3. The First Circuit Court of Appeals has held, however, that “a court may dismiss, rather than stay, a case when all of-the issues before the- court are arbitrable.” Bercovitch v. Baldwin Sch., Inc., 133 F.3d 141, 156 n. 21 (1st Cir.1998); accord Next Step Med. Co. v. Johnson & Johnson Int’l, 619 F.3d 67, 71 (1st Cir.2010) (“Where one side is entitled to arbitration of a claim brought in court; in this circuit a district court can, in its discretion, choose to. dismiss, the daw suit, if all claims asserted in the case are found arbitrable.”). Having found that all claims in this case are arbitrable, the Court DISMISSES the case, without prejudice.
