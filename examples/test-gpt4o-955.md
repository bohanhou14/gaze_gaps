In support of this conclusion, precedent within this jurisdiction emphasizes the importance of the structural and operational compliance of the retirement account to qualify under relevant statutory provisions. In re Kemp, 52 F.3d 546, 550 (5th Cir. 1995), highlights that amendment in voluntary bankruptcy without indication of bad faith or prejudice is permissible per Bankruptcy Rule 1009(a). However, such liberal amendment does not equate to blanket acceptance of exemptions, as illustrated by In re Osborn, 24 F.3d 1199, 1206 (10th Cir. 1994). Furthermore, In re Williamson, 804 F.2d 1355, 1358 (5th Cir. 1986), underscores that exemptions in converted cases must adhere to § 522(b) and § 348(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.

Additionally, Lowe's objections and subsequent appeals demonstrate the rigorous scrutiny courts apply to exemption claims. In Lowe's case, the court noted that exemptions may be challenged successfully if they fail to comply with fundamental criteria (103 F.3d 20). This aligns with the ruling that debtors must strictly adhere to regulatory standards to claim property as exempt (103 F.3d 20).

Similarly, the interpretation of "qualified" status in retirement accounts as elucidated in Plunk, 481 F.3d 302 (5th Cir. 2007), confirms that inherited IRAs, due to their operational differences and immediate accessibility, do not maintain their exempt status when scrutinized under applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions.

Thus, this Court holds that inherited IRAs from non-spouses do not meet the qualifications under § 42.0021 of the Texas Property Code for exemption, sustaining the Trustee's objection.

The Debtor is not barred from claiming the state exemptions even though the Debtor first elected the federal exemptions, and then, after the Trustee filed an objection to the federal exemptions, elected the state exemptions Bankruptcy Rule 1009(a) states that a "voluntary petition, list, schedule, or statement may be amended by the debtor as a matter of course at any time before the case is closed.” The Fifth Circuit has interpreted this rule to mean that in a voluntary bankruptcy case, a court shall allow a debtor to amend his schedule of exemptions before the case is closed, absent a creditor's showing of the debtor’s bad faith or prejudice to the creditors. Matter of Sandoval, 103 F.3d 20, 21 (5th Cir.1997); Matter of Williamson, 804 F.2d 1355, 1358 (5th Cir.1986). In the case at bar, the Trustee did not argue that the Debtor's amendment of his Schedule C was in bad faith or prejudicial.
