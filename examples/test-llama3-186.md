It is true that severe state-sanctioned economic deprivation can constitute persecution, Medhin v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 685, 689 (7th Cir.2003), but Chen alleged only that he was fired from his job, and we have held that being fired from a job, even if it is discriminatory, does not constitute persecution. Id.; Musabelliu, 442 F.3d at 994. Although Chen also claims that he was persecuted when family-planning authorities threatened him with “heightened penalties,” we have repeatedly held that vague, unfulfilled threats like this one generally do not compel a finding of past persecution.
