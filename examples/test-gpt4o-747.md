The issue regarding the scope of the plaintiff's complaint in relation to the notice of intent to sue under 29 U.S.C. § 626(d) is analogous to the principles established in Title VII cases. In particular, the district court in reference case 522 F.2d 1235 emphasized that the scope of a subsequent judicial inquiry should encompass any discrimination "like or reasonably related to the allegations of the charge and growing out of such allegations" (Danner v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 447 F.2d 159, 162 (5th Cir. 1971)). Applying this principle, the plaintiff's notice, which only specified termination, does not reasonably extend to retaliation and terms and conditions claims.

Moreover, in reference case 377 F.2d 239, it was established that claims must be explicitly stated in the original charge filed with the EEOC for them to be actionable subsequently. Although more lenient standards can sometimes be applied to the interpretation of EEOC charges, such principles should ensure that the claims remain consistent with the original factual assertions presented.

Following these precedents, plaintiff's additional claims of retaliation and adverse terms and conditions of employment are jurisdictionally barred due to non-compliance with the notice requirements specified by 29 U.S.C. § 626(d). Consequently, these claims must be dismissed.

In several Title VII cases where the complaint included but was not limited to the charge or charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), courts have stricken the new charges. See, e. g., Jenkins v. Blue Cross Mutual Hospital Insurance, Inc., 522 F.2d 1235, 1241 (7th Cir. 1975) (plaintiff precluded from suing for sex discrimination where her EEOC charge alleged only racial discrimination); Mickel v. South Carolina State Employment Service, 377 F.2d 239 (4th Cir. 1967) (dismissing claimant’s Title VII charge against employer where claimant filed an EEOC charge against employment agency only but brought suit against both the employment agency and the prospective employer); Edwards v. North American Rockwell Corp., 291 F.Supp. 199, 203-08 (C.D.Cal.1968) (dismissing race discrimination count where plaintiff had only properly filed an EEOC charge with respect to sex discrimination).
