As we review the case, it is essential to examine the jurisdictional issue. The plaintiff, Jerry D. Mee, claims that he has been denied due process and equal protection of the law. However, he fails to provide a source of jurisdiction in his complaint or response to defendants' motion for summary judgment. This is a crucial problem, as it affects the court's ability to hear the case.

In Reference case 408 U.S. 564, the Supreme Court emphasized that a state university teacher can acquire tenure as a "permanent" employee only after four years of year-to-year employment. Similarly, in Reference case 560 F.2d 925, the court held that the decision whether to rehire a nontenured teacher for another year rested on the unfettered discretion of university officials.

In this case, the plaintiff, Jerry D. Mee, was a temporary assistant public defender who was hired for a fixed term of one academic year. After completing his term, he was informed that he would not be rehired for the next academic year. The court found that Mee did not display a familiarity with substantive or procedural federal criminal law and misrepresented the financial position of the public defender's office.

The court also noted that the Judicial Council denied approval of Mee's appointment and suggested that he be discharged. Houdek, the federal public defender, then asked for Mee's re-ignation, which was not forthcoming, and Mee was fired. The court concluded that Mee's conduct before Judge Becker and Judge Hunter was the subject of some controversy.

In light of these facts, it is evident that Mee's claims are without merit. The court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case, as Mee fails to provide a valid basis for jurisdiction. Therefore, the court must dismiss the case.

gold_text: The Court can frankly find no statutory basis of jurisdiction. It could be argued that there is a direct right of action under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331. Cf. Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971); Owen v. City of Independence, 560 F.2d 925 (8th Cir. 1977). Assuming such a right of action plaintiff must still demonstrate that he was once on the appointments list and held a federally protected property interest in that status. See Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564,92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). He has shown neither.
