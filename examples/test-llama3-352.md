In the case of Fern v. United States, the appellants, retired members of the armed forces, sought just compensation under the Fifth Amendment for the portion of their retired pay that was awarded to their former spouses under a divorce decree. The appellants argued that the Uniform Services Former Spouses Protection Act (FSPA) constituted a taking of their property by the United States.

The court analyzed the case using the three-pronged test of Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 475 U.S. 211 (1986). The court found that FSPA did not have an economic impact on the appellants' rights to military retired pay vis-à-vis the United States. Instead, the court concluded that the FSPA merely lifted federal preemption of state law, allowing state courts to treat military retired pay as marital property.

The court also rejected the appellants' argument that they had a property right in continued federal preemption of state law, citing Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Env. Study Group, 438 U.S. 59 (1978). The court held that the FSPA did not effect a taking of the appellants' property and therefore did not require just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.

In reaching its decision, the court relied on several Supreme Court cases, including McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U.S. 210 (1981), which held that military retired pay is property divisible in divorce proceedings, and Mansell v. Mansell, — U.S. —, 109 S.Ct. 2023, 104 L.Ed.2d 675 (1989), which affirmed federal preemption of state law regarding military disability pay.

In conclusion, the court held that the FSPA did not constitute a taking of the appellants' property and therefore did not require just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. The court's decision was based on the analysis of the three-pronged test of Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. and the application of various Supreme Court cases, including McCarty v. McCarty and Mansell v. Mansell. <answer>

gold_text: . A computation of a lump sum evaluation of future payments (as an alternative to continuing future payments) would appear nebulous inasmuch as a military member has no entitlement to any continued level of retirement pay. Congress may alter and even eliminate military retired pay benefits whether classified as "current pay for reduced current services” or pension benefits. See Hisquierdo v.
