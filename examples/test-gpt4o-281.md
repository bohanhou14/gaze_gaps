In the current case, we must also consider the significance of the precedent set by other decisions such as 76 F.2d 134 and 83 F.2d 928. In 76 F.2d 134, it was held that better results obtained by using a larger amount of water than what was previously used do not necessarily render the process patentable. It is crucial that the process disclosed must inherently possess non-obvious and critical features, which was not sufficiently demonstrated. Similarly, in 83 F.2d 928, the court emphasized that the presence of affidavits or foreign patent decisions does not automatically confer inventiveness over prior art if the disclosed process does not demonstrate a significant departure from what is already known.

Additionally, the principles outlined in 92 F.2d 906 also apply here. That case clearly stated that utilizing an old art structure with slight modifications does not require an inventive step if it does not contribute something fundamentally new or non-obvious. Therefore, just as recognized in these referenced cases (92 F.2d 906, 76 F.2d 134, and 83 F.2d 928), the claimed processes must offer more than obvious modifications to existing methods to be considered patentable.

Thus, the decision of the Board of Appeals aligns with prior case law, affirming that if the inventive concept is inherent in the products themselves, the processes to make them, which are obvious to those skilled in the art, do not merit patent protection. Consequently, the decision to reject the process claims is affirmed.

gold_text: Appellant relies heavily on decisions in Canada and Great Britain which allegedly hold process claims allowable under circumstances similar to those of the instant case. We have repeatedly held that, in view of the differences between foreign patent laws and those of the United States, the allowance of patent claims in foreign countries is not pertinent to the .question whether similar claims should be allowed here; In re Guinot, 76 F.2d 134, 22 CCPA 1067; In re Kleine [Pfannenstiel, and Matthaes], 83 F.2d 928, 23 CCPA 1216; and In re Kluter, 92 F.2d 906, 25 CCPA 730. No reason appears for reaching a different conclusion here.
