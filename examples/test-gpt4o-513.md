Starks next argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court considered improper factors in varying upward from the Guidelines range. Specifically, he contends that the district court impermissibly lengthened his sentence to promote his rehabilitation, contrary to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319, 321 (2011). In Tapia, the Court held that a sentencing court may not impose or lengthen a prison term to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation. Nonetheless, the court may discuss the benefits of such programs and make recommendations to the Bureau of Prisons. 

In this case, while the district court mentioned Starks’ need for alcohol and mental health treatment, it primarily focused on his "consistent and violent criminal history" and the necessity to protect the public. These factors align with permissible considerations under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), as recognized in United States v. Blackmon, 662 F.3d 981, 986-87 (8th Cir. 2011) and United States v. Pickar, 666 F.3d 1167, 1172-73 (8th Cir. 2012).

Given the district court's careful balance of acceptable considerations and the lack of clear evidence that the sentence was extended for rehabilitative purposes alone, we find no substantive unreasonable error. The primary intent was to protect the public and account for Starks' criminal behavior, consistent with precedents such as United States v. Bain, 406 F.3d 543, 550 (8th Cir. 2005).

We therefore affirm the district court's judgment.

gold_text: Starks also alleges that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court impermissibly based its upward variance on the need to address Starks’s alcohol-treatment and mental-health needs, in violation of Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). Because Starks did not object on this basis before the district court, we review for plain error, under which “the defendant must show: (1) an error; (2) that is plain; and (3) that affects' substantial rights.” United States v. Blackmon, 662 F.3d 981, 986 (8th Cir. 2011). The district court justified the sentence based on Starks’s “consistent and violent criminal history,” as well as the need to protect his family and the public from the danger he poses by possessing a firearm. The district court then noted that its sentence was “also to address his needs for his alcohol problems and perhaps his mental health needs.” We acknowledge that the district court’s statement can be read as going beyond merely “discussing the opportunities for rehabilitation within prison,” id. at 987 (quoting Tapia, 564 U.S. at 334, 131 S.Ct. 2382), and we are reminded that Tapia forecloses district courts from imposing or lengthening a sentence to promote rehabilitation or facilitate a defendant’s participation in a treatment program. Nevertheless, assuming that the district court erroneously considered Starks’s needs for alcohol and mental-health treatment in imposing the sentence, Starks has not shown that he would have received a different sentence absent such error. See id. at 987 (“[W]here the effect of the error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate—where we would have to speculate—the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error.” (quoting United States v. Pirani, 406 F.3d 543, 553 (8th Cir. 2005) (en banc))); see also United States v. Pickar, 666 F.3d 1167, 1169-70 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Blackmon and holding no plain error in part because proper sentencing factors were dominant). Having failed to show that any error affected his substantial rights, Starks has thus not shown plain error.
