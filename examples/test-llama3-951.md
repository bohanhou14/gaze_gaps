The legal cases provided demonstrate the requirements for asylum and the concept of persecution. In the case 525 F.3d 999, it is evident that the cumulative effect of various instances of mistreatment can amount to persecution, even if each instance, when considered alone, may not be sufficient. The court emphasized that the record may still compel a finding of past persecution when considered as a whole.

In the case of 487 F.3d 855, the court highlighted that even if each incident of persecution is not severe, the cumulative effect of multiple incidents can lead to a finding of past persecution. The court also noted that the victim's credibility and corroboration of evidence are crucial in determining eligibility for asylum.

In Liu's case, the Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denied his applications for asylum and withholding of removal, citing a lack of corroboration of his alleged beating and detention. The BIA found that Liu's testimony was inconsistent and lacked details, and that he failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in the future.

However, Liu asserts that he established eligibility for asylum by demonstrating past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution. He argues that the cumulative effects of his alleged detention, beating, and instructions to report to the police station constitute persecution. Liu also contests the IJ's discussions regarding the lack of medical records, the sincerity of his religious beliefs, and his failure to contact other church members.

In reviewing the IJ's decision, we must apply the substantial evidence test and determine whether the record compels a finding of past persecution. As stated in Adefemi v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004), we will only reverse the IJ's finding if the record compels a reversal.

In conclusion, the legal cases and Liu's case demonstrate the importance of corroboration and credibility in determining eligibility for asylum. The cumulative effect of various instances of mistreatment can amount to persecution, and the applicant must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in the future.

gold_text: We recently have held, however, that oppressive acts can collectively or cumulatively amount to persecution. See De Santamaria v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 525 F.3d 999, 1008 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that record compelled a finding of persecution where petitioner’s life was repeatedly threatened over the course of two years, petitioner was yanked by her hair out of her vehicle, injuring her, and threatened with death if she continued her political activities, her family groundskeeper was tortured and killed for not revealing her whereabouts, and petitioner was beaten, kidnapped, and warned of her imminent murder); Delgado v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 487 F.3d 855, 859, 861-62 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that although individually the following incidents would not compel the conclusion that petitioners suffered past persecution, the “cumulative effects” of: (1) masked men pointing unloaded weapons at them and pulling the triggers; (2) the attack and severe beating of one of the petitioners; (3) continued threatening calls; and (4) the tampering with and vandalizing of one of their cars, compelled a finding of eligibility for withholding of removal).
