The parties' understanding of the contract should align with their behavior and communications during the period preceding the controversy. As established in cases like **Topliff v. Topliff**, 122 U.S. 121, 181 (1887), and **Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. United States**, 444 F.2d 547, 551 (1971), “external indications of the parties’ joint understanding, contemporaneously and later, of what the contract imported” are often more revealing than the written contract alone (Reference cases **467 F.2d 1323**, **467 F.2d 1323**). The consistent references to total precasting in the bid schedules, contract clauses, and subsequent correspondence indicate that both parties understood and agreed to a total precast method, not a partial one. This mutual understanding reinforces the necessity for plaintiff’s adherence to the contract demands and the appropriateness of requiring a VECP for any proposed deviations. Plaintiff’s departure from this understanding, without a VECP submission, justifies the defendant's position and entitles it to summary judgment. Therefore, the plaintiff's proposal constituted deviations from the contract's spirit and required explicit approval through the VECP process, which was never pursued by the plaintiff.

United States, 41 Fed.Cl. 585, 591 (1998). “[H]ow the parties act under the arrangement, before the advent of controversy, is often more revealing than the dry language of the written agreement by itself.” Macke Co. v. United States, 199 Ct.Cl. 552, 467 F.2d 1323, 1325 (Ct.Cl.1972). In the instant case, plaintiffs understanding during the bidding process and at the time of contracting is key to whether it is entitled to relief. The most compelling indicator of plaintiffs understanding during this critical time comes from the plain language of the subcontract, because the terms were discussed and agreed upon during the bidding process and prior to issuance of the award.
