In the case of Marcelo Mancia-Perez, the district court dismissed the original indictment without prejudice for violations of the Speedy Trial Act. Mancia-Perez appeals, arguing that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the indictment without prejudice. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion.

The district court considered the seriousness of the offense, the facts and circumstances that led to the dismissal, and the impact of reprosecution on the administration of the Speedy Trial Act and on justice in general. The seriousness of the offense was significant, as Mancia-Perez was convicted of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, which is considered an aggravated felony (Galvan-Rodriguez, 169 F.3d 217).

The district court also considered the Government's reason for having violated the Act. Although the Government conceded negligence, it did not explain why it was negligent. The Government stated, however, that there was no ulterior motive behind the delay and that it had timely filed over one hundred illegal reentry cases in 2001. This is similar to the situation in Martinez-Espinoza, where the Government's apparent negligence in not timely filing the indictment was found not to be a basis for dismissing the indictment with prejudice (Martinez-Espinoza, 299 F.3d 414).

The district court also considered the impact of reprosecution on the administration of the Speedy Trial Act and on justice in general. The public has a great interest in bringing to trial defendants, especially recidivists, who have been accused of committing serious crimes (Johnson, 29 F.3d 940). Mancia-Perez has a lengthy criminal history, which includes convictions for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, theft, and burglary. The district court properly considered the statutory factors of ยง 3162(a)(2) and its supporting factual findings were not clearly in error. Taylor, 487 U.S. 326.

In conclusion, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the original indictment without prejudice. The seriousness of the offense, the Government's reason for having violated the Act, and the impact of reprosecution on the administration of the Speedy Trial Act and on justice in general all weigh in favor of a dismissal without prejudice. The public has a great interest in bringing to trial defendants, especially recidivists, who have been accused of committing serious crimes (Johnson, 29 F.3

gold_text: Mancia argues for the first time on appeal that the felony and aggravated-felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. ยง 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional. Mancia concedes that this argument is foreclosed by Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). He nevertheless seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review in the light of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).
