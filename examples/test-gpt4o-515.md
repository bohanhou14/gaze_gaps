V.
Turning to the plaintiffs' due process claims, they argue that the statutory scheme under which they were prosecuted is unconstitutional for failing to afford them adequate procedural safeguards. Specifically, they contend that the statute's application resulted in an arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement process. In Washington v. Watkins, 655 F.2d 1346, 1354 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 949 (1982), the court highlighted that a system lacking explicit procedural protections might infringe upon due process rights. Similarly, in the case before us, plaintiffs allege procedural due process violations on the grounds of inadequate notice and the arbitrary manner of enforcement.

Moreover, the equal protection claims, though already addressed, warrant a brief reconsideration in light of precedent. In affirming the district court's judgment, we recognize the principle established in Tyler v. Mmes. Pasend, 796 F.2d 94 (1986), that statutory eligibility disputes based on federal statutes do not override due process and equal protection established under the Fourteenth Amendment. Although skepticism towards the constitutional claims exists, as seen in Tyler, we acknowledge that plaintiffs' allegations merit further scrutiny.

Therefore, consistent with established judicial principles and referencing both 655 F.2d 1346 and 796 F.2d 94, we affirm that their complaints require an in-depth examination in the district court. Consequently, the judgment is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.
