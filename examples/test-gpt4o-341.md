2. Plaintiff’s Failure to File a Claim for Refund

Defendant also moved to dismiss the claims for the tax years 1983, 1984, and 1993 on the grounds that plaintiff did not file a claim for refund with the IRS, which is a jurisdictional prerequisite to bringing a suit in this court. Under 26 U.S.C. § 7422(a), no suit for the recovery of any internal revenue tax shall be maintained in any court unless a claim for refund has been duly filed with the IRS. 

This requirement is corroborated by the Supreme Court in Flora v. United States, as referenced in 357 U.S. 63 and reaffirmed in 362 U.S. 145, where the Court held that full payment of assessed taxes is necessary as a jurisdictional prerequisite for a refund suit. Here, the plaintiff’s failure to file a refund claim for the tax years 1983, 1984, and 1993 is akin to not fulfilling a fundamental procedural requirement, rendering the court without subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the suit. 

As plaintiff did not adequately comply with the necessary administrative procedures to seek a tax refund for these years, the court finds itself compelled to dismiss the claims for these specific tax years, alongside the claims for 1985 through 1992 due to non-payment of the assessed taxes before initiating this action.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the court grants defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiff’s claims for the tax years 1983 through 1993 are hereby dismissed.

It is SO ORDERED.

gold_text: It is well-settled that this court’s jurisdiction over a suit for tax refund is premised upon the full-payment of the tax that is the source of the claim. Flora v. United States, 357 U.S. 63, 78 S.Ct. 1079, 2 L.Ed.2d. 1165, aff'd on reh’g, 362 U.S. 145, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960); Rohmann, 25 Cl.Ct. 283. Plaintiff failed to demonstrate full-payment of his taxes for the 1985 through 1992 tax years. Therefore, the court finds that it does not have jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims for those years.
