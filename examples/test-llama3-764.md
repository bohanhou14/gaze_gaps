You are challenging the valuation date utilized by the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court valued the Agreement as of the petition date. Comcast asserts that the statutory text and case law dictate that the appropriate valuation date is the effective date of the plan, which would result in a higher valuation of the Agreement that is eligible for a § 1111(b) election. The Teams argue that Stembridge mandates valuation as of the petition date, and that the bankruptcy court correctly held that the Agreement was of inconsequential value and ineligible for § 1111(b).

I conclude that a court is not required to use either the petition date or the effective date. Courts have the flexibility to select the valuation date so long as the bankruptcy court takes into account the purpose of the valuation and the proposed use or disposition of the collateral at issue. [1] The Bankruptcy Code itself does not dictate the appropriate valuation date for Chapter 11 bankruptcies. [2]

The Third and Eighth Circuits have held that the effective or confirmation date of the plan is the appropriate valuation date in a Chapter 11 cram-down valuation. [3] [4] These holdings are consistent with the leading bankruptcy treatise's discussion of the issue. [5]

However, the bankruptcy court erred in deducting the Teams' unpaid, waived media fees from the value of Comcast's collateral. [6] The costs will not be borne by the Network and therefore are not deductible from the collateral the Network retains under the Plan. [7] The bankruptcy court must re-value the collateral in light of the Plan, without recourse to hypothetical situations which are neither proposed nor likely in this Chapter 11 cram-down.

For the foregoing reasons, we REMAND this case to the bankruptcy court for a re-valuation of the collateral in light of the Plan. [8]
