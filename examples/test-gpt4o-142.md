Reed's first contention involves the three-level management role enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l(b). Reed claims it lacks evidentiary support and specific factual findings. Evaluating management role enhancements requires clear factual findings, as mandated by United States v. Molina, which demands that such findings must be adequate to support the sentence (514 F.3d 209, citing Molina, 356 F.3d at 275-76).

Here, the District Court’s reliance merely on the PSR without additional specific findings parallels the inadequacies found in United States v. Lewis (489 F.3d 528). Just as in Lewis, where the District Court's lack of detailed explanation constituted plain error requiring remand, Reed’s case similarly suffers from insufficient findings. Thus, the absence of specific reasons impacts Reed’s substantial rights, warranting a remand for resentencing (Lewis, 424 F.3d at 247 n. 5).

Furthermore, reviewing de novo, appellate courts must scrutinize the District Court’s factual findings under a clear error standard (202 F.3d 622). Given this precedent, the District Court must either supplement the record or reconsider the necessity of the enhancement upon remand (577 F.3d 442).

Therefore, the enhanced sentence imposed under U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l(b) is vacated. This matter is remanded to the District Court for proper factual findings or reconsideration of the enhancement under current guidelines.

gold_text: Regarding Reed’s challenge to the district court’s imposition of a three-level enhancement pursuant Section 3Bl.l(b), we find that it fails, as the district court made adequate factual findings. Before imposing a sentencing enhancement pursuant to Section 3B1.1, a district court must make a specific finding as to why a particular section applies. See United States v. Ware, 577 F.3d 442, 451 (2d Cir.2009) (citing United States v. Espinoza, 514 F.3d 209, 212 (2d Cir.2008)). “The findings of the sentencing court must be sufficiently specific to permit meaningful appellate review.” Ware, 577 F.3d at 452. A sentencing court may adopt the factual statements contained in a PSR, although adoption is not sufficient if the PSR itself does not contain enough facts to enable meaningful review. Id.; see also United States v. Carter, 489 F.3d 528, 540 (2d Cir.2007). Our review of whether the district court’s factual findings support its decision to impose the enhancement pursuant to Section 3Bl.l(b) is de novo. United States v. Paccione, 202 F.3d 622, 624 (2d Cir.2000).
