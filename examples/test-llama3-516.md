In the case of United States v. Miller, the defendant pled guilty to mail fraud for over-billing third-party insurers for services rendered in his medical practice. The district court calculated the loss attributable to Miller's fraud by using the amount he intended to obtain, rather than the actual amount received. Miller argues that the district court erred in using intended loss, rather than actual loss, in calculating the fraud loss amount.

The reference case of Geevers, 226 F.3d 186, supports the use of intended loss in calculating the fraud loss amount. In Geevers, the court held that a district court may use intended loss, rather than actual loss, in calculating the fraud loss amount, as long as the intended loss is greater than the actual loss. The court also noted that a prima facie showing of intent can be made by introducing evidence of the face value of the checks deposited by the defendant.

In the case of United States v. Hayes, 242 F.3d 114, the court also used intended loss in calculating the fraud loss amount. The court held that the district court did not err in using the amount a defendant billed, rather than the amount actually received, in calculating the fraud loss amount.

In contrast, the reference case of United States v. Dawkins, 202 F.3d 711, does not support the use of intended loss in calculating the fraud loss amount. In Dawkins, the court held that a district court may not use intended loss, rather than actual loss, in calculating the fraud loss amount, as long as the intended loss is not greater than the actual loss.

In conclusion, the district court did not err in using intended loss in calculating the fraud loss amount in Miller's case. The reference cases of Geevers and Hayes support the use of intended loss in calculating the fraud loss amount, while the reference case of Dawkins does not. Therefore, the district court's decision is affirmed.

gold_text: The Third Circuit recently considered an argument very similar to Miller’s in Geevers, 226 F.3d at 193. In that case, the defendant, convicted of bank fraud, contended that the district court erred in finding that the relevant loss amount caused by his fraud was the total face value of his fraudulent checks because “he could not have successfully withdrawn those funds even if he had wanted to.” Id. at 189. The court of appeals rejected this argument, reasoning that a sentencing court may “draw inferences from the face value of ... checks [$2,000,000] in arriving at the factual conclusion that the defendant intended” losses in the face value amount, even though he only withdrew $400,000. Id. at 193. Indeed, the court held that the prosecution’s introduction of evidence regarding the face value of the defendant’s fraudulent checks constituted a “prima facie case” of intended loss. Id.; see also United States v. Kushner, 305 F.3d 194, 197-98 (3d Cir.2002); United States v. Hayes, 242 F.3d 114, 118 (3d Cir.2001). So it is in this case — the district court did not clearly err in relying on the amount Miller billed Medicare and Medicaid as prima facie evidence of the amount of loss he intended to cause.
