Regarding the indemnity claim, the court has ruled that an implied indemnity claim is not available for redress of a garden variety breach of contract. In the absence of an express provision for indemnity, implied indemnity will be found only in limited circumstances, such as where there is a special contractual relationship between the parties, or where there is a great disparity in the fault of two tortfeasors and one tortfeasor has paid for loss which was primarily the responsibility for the other.

In the case of General Electric Co. v. Moretz, 270 F.2d 780, the court found an implied right of indemnity where there was a special contractual relationship between the parties, such as a unique element to the contractual relationship which gave rise to the implied right. However, in this case, there is no such unique element, and therefore, an implied indemnity claim is not available.

Furthermore, the court has also ruled that a claim by Coal Equity for breach of contract would be barred for the same reason that such claim by CRI as a third-party beneficiary of the contract has been found to be barred. Coal Equity contends that its indemnity claim will ripen if and only if it is found liable to CRI. However, the court has already found that the claim for breach of contract against LG & E is time-barred, and therefore, the indemnity claim is also barred.

In conclusion, the court has ruled that an implied indemnity claim is not available for redress of a garden variety breach of contract, and the indemnity claim by Coal Equity against LG & E is barred. The court has also ruled that a claim by Coal Equity for breach of contract would be barred for the same reason that such claim by CRI as a third-party beneficiary of the contract has been found to be barred.

In the case of Marsh & McLennan v. ISLIC, 838 F.2d 124, the court found that there was no duty of Marsh & McLennan to the City which was breached causing injury to the City. This decision is relevant to the present case, as it highlights the importance of considering the contractual relationship between the parties in determining whether an indemnity claim is available.

gold_text: The facts before us can be distinguished from the few cases in which a special relationship has been found. In General Electric Co. v. Moretz, 270 F.2d 780 (4th Cir.1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 964, 80 S.Ct. 593, 4 L.Ed.2d 545 (1960), a truck driver was injured when the load he was transporting shifted and the truck wrecked. The driver sued the shipper who had negligently loaded the truck, and the shipper in turn sued the common carrier who had failed to secure the load properly. The court read certain Virginia and federal statutes and ICC regulations into the contract between shipper and carrier. The court found that the incorporation of these provisions established a special contractual relationship giving rise to an implied right of indemnity. Cf., International Surplus Lines Insurance Company v. Marsh & McLennan, Inc., 838 F.2d 124 (4th Cir.1988)(no special relationship recognized in ordinary insurance brokerage arrangement, rejecting application of Ryan and Moretz).
