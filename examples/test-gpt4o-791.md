In addressing the claim concerning the unavailability of the informer, Scott, it is important to note analogous case law. In reference case 340 F.2d 453, the court held that the government was not required to call an informer as a witness, especially when the informer’s testimony would have been cumulative and the defense had ample opportunity to subpoena and interrogate the individual. Similarly, Comulada had the opportunity to request Scott's presence but opted not to. Furthermore, consistent with reference case 313 F.2d 757, where the necessity of an adjournment rather than an acquittal under circumstances of surprise was emphasized, Comulada's defense could have sought similar relief regarding the informer’s testimony but failed to do so. Therefore, the trial’s fairness remains intact, as the defense did not pursue available alternatives to rectify the alleged misinformation about Scott’s whereabouts. Judge Cooper's guidance to the jury regarding Scott's failure to testify appropriately addressed any potential negative inference, aligning with judicial precedents ensuring procedural integrity and due process.

gold_text: We note that in case after case, in appeals from convictions for trafficking in narcotics, we hear arguments regarding the government’s failure to call the informer or special employee. See e. g., United States v. D’Angiolillo, 340 F.2d 453 (2 Cir.1965); United States v. Cimino, supra; United States v. Glaze, 313 F.2d 757 (2 Cir.1963); United States v. Colletti, 245 F.2d 781 (2 Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Russo v. United States, 355 U.S. 874, 78 S.Ct. 125, 2 L.Ed.2d 78 (1957); see also United States v. Lanza, 329 F.2d 422 (2 Cir.1964). It seems to be defense strategy to bring out facts from which it can be argued that the government or the court should have called the informer as a witness. Almost never is there a genuine effort to find the witness or to call him even when it is certain that he is available and subject to process. See United States v. D’Angiolillo, supra. We think that this is another such case.
