In the context of a civil forfeiture action, the doctrine of collateral estoppel may not be applicable due to the difference in the burden of proof in criminal and civil cases. As stated in Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 391, 397 (1938), "an adjudication that the proof was not sufficient to overcome all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused" does not necessarily determine the issue in a civil proceeding.

In this case, the Government's complaint for forfeiture was filed after Collins's criminal acquittal. The Government need not show probable cause until the forfeiture trial, as stated in United States v. Banco Cafetero Panama, 797 F.2d 1154, 1162 (2nd Cir.1986). Furthermore, the Government is entitled to supplement its evidence of probable cause between the filing of the complaint and the forfeiture trial, as stated in United States v. Premises and Real Property at 4496 South Livonia Road, Livonia, New York, 889 F.2d 1258, 1268 (2nd Cir.1989).

The evidence presented in this case suggests that the seized currency is drug-related. A large sum of cash, nervous behavior by the person carrying the currency, and a positive canine alert for the presence of a controlled substance on the seized currency are all strong indicators of drug activity. Additionally, the fact that Collins's wife's name was on the title of the van containing the marijuana and that Collins himself was arrested for possession of cocaine further supports the Government's claim.

Therefore, based on the evidence presented, it is likely that the seized currency is subject to forfeiture. The doctrine of collateral estoppel is not applicable in this case, and the Government has met its burden of proving probable cause for the forfeiture.

gold_text: 8. Civil forfeiture actions are independent of criminal proceedings. Thus, the Government is not required to show that the claimant was convicted of a crime related to the seized property. Likewise, an acquittal or dismissal of criminal charges does not affect the Governmentâ€™s ability to pursue a civil forfeiture action, even if the civil forfeiture arises from the same activity.
