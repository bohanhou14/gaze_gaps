Although there is no statutory definition of what constitutes "cause shown" under 28 U.S.C. § 157(d), the statute requires that cause be demonstrated to withdraw the reference. See In re Pruitt, 910 F.2d 1160, 1168 (3d Cir. 1990). In determining whether cause has been shown, the primary inquiry is whether the matter in question is "core" or "non-core" to the bankruptcy case. Additionally, other considerations include promoting uniformity in bankruptcy administration, reducing forum shopping and confusion, fostering the economical use of debtor's and creditor's resources, and expediting the bankruptcy process. See In re Pruitt, 910 F.2d at 1165; Holland Am. Ins. Co. v. Succession of Roy, 777 F.2d 992, 999 (5th Cir. 1985).

Traveler's argument that withdrawal will promote judicial efficiency and economically utilize the debtor's and creditors' resources is flawed since this matter is a core proceeding that the bankruptcy court is empowered to adjudicate. The court finds no compelling reason to disturb the currently established course, as maintaining the case in bankruptcy court serves judicial economy by benefitting from the bankruptcy court's familiarity with the case's particulars. Further, expediting the bankruptcy process and preserving the uniformity of bankruptcy administration are paramount. Thus, withdrawal is unwarranted under these standards.

gold_text: Although there is no statutory definition of what constitutes “cause shown” under 28 U.S.C. § 157(d) for permissive withdrawal of a reference, “the statute requires in clear terms that cause be shown before the reference can be withdrawn.” In re Pruitt, 910 F.2d 1160, 1168 (3d Cir. 1990). The Third Circuit has set forth several factors which the District Court should consider when deciding whether to withdraw the reference in order to promote judicial economy: (1) promoting uniformity in bankruptcy administration; (2) reducing forum shopping and confusion; (3) fostering the economical use of the debtors’ and creditors’ resources; and (4) expediting the bankruptcy process. Id. at 1165 (adopting Holland Am. Ins. Co. v. Succession of Roy, 777 F.2d 992, 999 (5th Cir.1985)). In determining whether cause is shown, courts generally begin by considering the threshold question of whether the matter to be withdrawn is “core” or “non-core” to the bankruptcy case. In re Pelullo, No. 95-22430, 1997 WL 535155 (E.D.Pa. Aug.15, 1997). Another factor to consider when determining whether cause is shown for withdrawal is whether or not there has been a jury demand and, if so, whether the party demanding the jury trial is entitled to a trial by jury. This Court has already determined that the adversary action is core. Therefore, in the matter sub judice, this Court must first determine if Travelers is entitled to a jury trial. If Travelers is entitled to a jury trial, then this Court must decide whether the principles of judicial economy would be better served by withdrawing the reference to the Bankruptcy Court.
