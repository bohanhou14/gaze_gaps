The adequacy of representation remains a pivotal issue in intervention as a matter of right under RUSCC 24(a)(2). Per reference case 408 F.2d 175, intervention is allowed unless the applicant’s interest is "adequately represented by existing parties." Here, the proposed intervenors argue that their interests are inadequately represented by the Te-Moak Bands. Nevertheless, the precedent specifies that a minimal showing of impaired rights can suffice, yet a mere difference of opinion between attorneys does not meet this threshold (Stadin v. Union Elec. Co., 309 F.2d 912).

Moreover, the intervenors' claim of improper handling by the Te-Moak Bands regarding the 1872 stipulation lacks merit. Per reference case 385 F.2d 694, the burden falls on those opposing intervention to demonstrate adequacy of existing representation. The Te-Moak Bands shared identical interests with the proposed intervenors, aiming for maximum compensation. This alignment diminishes claims of inadequate representation, particularly given the longstanding joint efforts in earlier stages of this case.

Therefore, given the analysis and precedents, the court must conclude that the intervenors' interests are indeed represented adequately by the existing parties. Consequently, the motion for intervention is denied.

gold_text: The rules governing motions for intervention require that intervenors must be represented adequately, and, in so doing, encompass the intervenors’ due process rights. Indeed, the requirements and standards under RUSCC 24(a)(2) are “primarily an interest test and a practical guide to disposing of lawsuits by involving as many apparently concerned persons as is compatible with efficiency and due process.” Smuck v. Hobson, 408 F.2d 175, 179 (D.C. Cir.1969) (en banc); Nuesse v. Camp, 385 F.2d 694, 700 (D.C.Cir.1967). For reasons stated above, the court has determined that the proposed intervenors are adequately represented by the Te-Moak Bands and, accordingly, the requirements of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment have been met.
