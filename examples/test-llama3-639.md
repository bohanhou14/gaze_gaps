The reference cases you provided (392 U.S. 83, 344 U.S. 237, and 438 U.S. 726) are all related to the concept of advisory opinions and the limits of federal judicial power. In the context of the Coalition's petition, the issue at hand is whether the FCC's failure to issue a declaratory order constitutes agency action that can be reviewed by the courts.

As the Supreme Court has held in Muskrat v. United States (392 U.S. 83), the federal courts will not give advisory opinions, and the rule against advisory opinions is rooted in the separation of powers prescribed by the Constitution. Similarly, the court in Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory (344 U.S. 237) emphasized the importance of confining federal courts to a role consistent with the system of separated powers and the traditional justiciability doctrine.

In the case at hand, the Coalition's petition seeks a declaration that the fairness doctrine is statutorily mandated, but the FCC has not issued a declaratory order on the matter. The Coalition argues that the FCC's failure to act constitutes agency action that can be reviewed by the courts, but the court in Greater L.A. Council on Deafness, Inc. v. Baldrige (827 F.2d 1353) held that a court does not have the power to order an agency to investigate a complaint or to declare what an agency's duties are under a statute until the agency has addressed the issue itself.

Therefore, the court in this case must dismiss the Coalition's petition, as it seeks an advisory opinion on the merits of the fairness doctrine, which is beyond the court's power to render. The court should not rule on the merits of the matter, but rather leave it to the FCC to issue a declaratory order or to resolve the issue through administrative proceedings.

gold_text: Thus, even if the FCC had issued a general declaratory order as the Coalition requested, any review by this court would amount to an advisory opinion prohibited under Article III of the Constitution. See Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 96, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1950, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). While the FCC might properly issue such a general declaration which does not settle an actual controversy between adverse parties, this court cannot. See Public Service Comm’n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 242-43, 73 S.Ct. 236, 239-40, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952). As the Supreme Court has explained, “This Court ... reviews judgments, not statements in opinions.... However appropriate it may be for an administrative agency to write broadly in an adjudicatory proceeding, federal courts have never been empowered to issue advisory opinions.” FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726, 734-35, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 3032-33, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978) (citations omitted).
