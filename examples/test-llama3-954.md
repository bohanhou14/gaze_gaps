In the context of bankruptcy, a debtor's decision to seek dismissal is subject to review by the court. As stated in Reference Case 15 B.R. 655, the court may dismiss a case under 11 U.S.C. § 707 only after notice and a hearing, and only for cause, including unreasonable delay by the debtor that is prejudicial to creditors.

In the present case, the debtors have filed a motion to dismiss their chapter 7 case, citing the costs, expenses, and risks involved in litigating the trustee's objections to their exemption claim. However, as seen in Reference Case 3 B.R. 167, a debtor does not have the same degree of discretion in deciding whether to terminate the proceedings once they are started.

The court finds that the debtors' decision to seek dismissal is not justified, as they have not shown sufficient cause for the dismissal of their case. The trustee's potential success in a preferential transfer action against the debtor's father does not constitute a valid reason for dismissal, as the debtor's assets would still be liquidated for the benefit of their creditors.

Therefore, the court denies the debtors' motion to dismiss their chapter 7 case. The trustee's objections to the debtors' exemption claim will be resolved through the normal adversarial process, and the debtors will have the opportunity to pursue their claims for exemption in the usual manner.
