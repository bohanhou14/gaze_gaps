The reference cases cited, including cases 28 L. Ed. 101, 33 L. Ed. 447, 33 L. Ed. 918, 35 L. Ed. 640, and 40 L. Ed. 688, demonstrate that the court's jurisdiction over a controversy involving real property is governed by the eighth section of Act March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 472 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 513].

The case at bar presents a controversy involving the adjustment of rights dependent on a formal written agreement, where the complainant seeks to enforce a lien on real property within the district. The respondent, however, has not been an inhabitant of, or found within, the district, and has not voluntarily appeared thereto.

In this light, the court must consider whether it has jurisdiction over the controversy. In Hart v. Sansom, 110 U. S. 151, the court held that a decree rendered in a court of equity, without personal service on a non-resident defendant, is not entitled to recognition in a Federal court.

However, in Arndt v. Griggs, 134 U. S. 316, the court held that a State has the power to bring a non-resident into its courts for purposes of adjudicating the validity of a claim to real property, provided that the mode of proceeding does not conflict with some special inhibition of the Constitution and is not against natural justice.

In the present case, the respondent has not been found within the district, and has not voluntarily appeared thereto. Therefore, the court has the power to make an order directing the respondent to appear, plead, answer, or demur, as provided in the eighth section of Act March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 472 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 513].

In conclusion, the court has jurisdiction over the controversy, and the respondent's motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction is denied.

gold_text: This leaves only one proposition which can be claimed to be strictly one of jurisdiction, and which, therefore, ought to be considered by us; that in the absence of any special statutory provision as to the form of relief in case the complainant is entitled to any, a Circuit Court of the United States sitting in equity is powerless to shape it. Of course, if we are powerless to give relief in case we find the merits are with the complainant, it would be fruitless for us to proceed further and the bill should be dismissed; but if the complainant has any right we are confident that some form of relief will be found, although it would not at present be prudent to assume to forecast its particular character, nor would we be able to do so with certainty. What it would be will, of course, depend on the particular result on the merits. In this respect the respondent shares the impression which has gone abroad from the decision of the Supreme Court in Hart v. Sansom, 110 U. S. 151, 3 Sup. Ct. 586, 28 L. Ed. 101. Taken broadly, and in some aspects in which it might be taken, the result of that case would be astonishing, and might afford serious difficulties in the way of the present complainant; but Hart v. Sansom has never been taken seriously since it was announced. Indeed, subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court have so cut it down that it must be held to have decided only as to the particular form of procedure marked out by the judgment which it reviewed. Sugg v. Thornton, 132 U. S. 524, 10 Sup. Ct. 163, 33 L. Ed. 447; Arndt v. Griggs, 134 U. S. 316, 10 Sup. Ct. 557, 33 L. Ed. 918; Carpenter v. Strange, 141 U. S. 87, 106, 11 Sup. Ct. 960, 35 L. Ed. 640; and other cases which might be cited. That it has no application to the federal courts proceeding upon broad principles of equity was formally decided in Lynch v. Murphy, 161 U. S. 247, 250, 251, 252, 16 Sup. Ct. 523, 40 L. Ed. 688, where exactly the relief prayed for by the complainant, in the way of appointing a trustee to make a conveyance of the title of an absent party by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, was sustained.
