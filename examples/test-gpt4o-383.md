To resolve Patel's case, we must determine whether the record of conviction sufficiently establishes his intent to permanently deprive the owners of their property, thus making his larceny offense a CIMT. The BIA applied the modified categorical approach, but we find that approach problematic for several reasons.

First, as highlighted by the court in Wala v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d 102 (2d Cir.2007), the plea colloquy must unambiguously establish the defendant’s intent to permanently deprive the owner. Similar to Wala, where the Second Circuit concluded that inferences about the petitioner’s intent were not sufficient, here, Patel’s record lacks clear evidence that he intended a permanent deprivation, as mere description of the offenses does not substantiate permanent intent (678 F.3d 138).

Further, by our precedent in Campbell v. Holder, 698 F.3d 29 (1st Cir.2012), the government bears the burden of proving that the offense matches the generic definition of a CIMT by clear and convincing evidence. In this case, the government failed to conclusively demonstrate that Patel's theft intended permanent deprivation (551 F.3d 1076).

Therefore, due to the ambiguity and lack of definitive evidence in the record that Patel’s actions constituted a CIMT, we reverse the BIA’s determination and grant Patel's petition.

The Wala court’s bottom-line conclusion was that, “although it may have been reasonable for the BIA to infer that Wala intended permanently to keep the items he admitted taking, the modified categorical approach does not permit the BIA to draw inferences of this kind.” Id.; accord Akinsade v. Holder, 678 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir.2012); cf. Renteria-Morales v. Mukasey, 551 F.3d 1076, 1085 (9th Cir.2008) (inferences drawn from the record of conviction must be “necessary,” not merely “reasonable”).
