In the case of United States v. Colin-Velasquez, the defendant moves to suppress the fruits of the search of his automobile and the statements he made to law enforcement officers. The government contends that the stop and arrest of Colin-Velasquez was valid because there was probable cause for the police officers to believe that Colin-Velasquez had committed narcotic and traffic offenses.

In determining whether the stop and search of Colin-Velasquez's vehicle was valid, the court must consider the factors mentioned in the case of United States v. Noti, 731 F.2d 610. The court must balance the interests of the public in protecting the flow of information with the interests of the defendant in preparing his defense. In this case, the court finds that the testimony of Officer Anderson and Sergeant Hudson was credible, and that there was probable cause to stop and search the vehicle.

Regarding the search of Colin-Velasquez's vehicle, the government argues that the search was valid based on both probable cause for the search and the consent given by Colin-Velasquez. In the case of United States v. Lopez, 908 F.2d 471, the court held that even an inaccurate warning may be sufficient if there is direct evidence that the defendant was aware of his rights. In this case, Colin-Velasquez acknowledged understanding his rights, and Sergeant Hudson took care to proceed with the search of the vehicle only after he was sure that Colin-Velasquez had consented to the search.

Finally, regarding the statements made by Colin-Velasquez, the government argues that they were voluntary and not in violation of the Fifth Amendment. In the case of United States v. Pheaster, 630 F.2d 661, the court held that even an inaccurate warning may be sufficient if there is direct evidence that the defendant was aware of his rights. In this case, Colin-Velasquez acknowledged understanding his rights, and Sergeant Hudson recited Miranda warnings to Colin-Velasquez from memory, although with some inaccuracies.

In conclusion, the court finds that the stop and search of Colin-Velasquez's vehicle was valid, and that the statements made by Colin-Velasquez were voluntary and not in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The court grants the government's motion to dismiss the defendant's motion to suppress the fruits of the search of his automobile and the statements he made to law enforcement officers.

gold_text: The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that advisement of the right to have counsel present during questioning “is mandated by the Constitution.” United States v. Noti, 731 F.2d 610, 615 (9th Cir.1984); accord United States v. Bland, 908 F.2d 471, 474 (9th Cir.1990). Here, Sergeant Hudson first informed Colin-Velasquez that he had the right to have an attorney present prior to questioning. However, immediately thereafter, Sergeant Hudson presented Colin-Velasquez with a Miranda rights card in Spanish and asked him to read the card. After reading the card, Colin-Velasquez then acknowledged understanding his rights. Because Colin-Velasquez was provided with accurate Miranda warnings in his native language immediately after receiving the incomplete warnings, the court finds no violation of his constitutional rights. See United States v. Lopez-Diaz, 630 F.2d 661, 664 (9th Cir.1980) (“even though the second of the three warnings given to [the defendant] was inaccurate, he was adequately apprised of his Miranda rights”).
