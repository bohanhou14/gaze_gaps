The cases of 959 F.2d 521 and 895 F.2d 46 provide guidance on the admissibility of evidence in legal proceedings. In the case of 959 F.2d 521, the court held that statements made by a plaintiff in an affidavit were not hearsay and were admissible to show reliance on the defendant's misrepresentations. The court noted that the statements were based on personal knowledge and were not offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted.

Similarly, in the case of 895 F.2d 46, the court held that an interrogatory answer that was not based on personal knowledge was not admissible to defeat summary judgment. The court noted that the answer was deficient and did not meet the requirements of Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

In the instant case, it is clear that the defendants' answers to the plaintiffs' interrogatories were not based on personal knowledge and were not admissible to defeat summary judgment. The defendants' reliance on the case of 959 F.2d 521 is misplaced, as the court's holding in that case is limited to the specific facts of that case and does not apply to the instant case.

Furthermore, the defendants' assertion that the case of 895 F.2d 46 supports their position is also misplaced, as the court's holding in that case is based on the specific facts of that case and does not apply to the instant case.

In conclusion, the defendants' answers to the plaintiffs' interrogatories were not admissible to defeat summary judgment and the court's decision to grant summary judgment was proper. The cases of 959 F.2d 521 and 895 F.2d 46 do not support the defendants' position and are not applicable to the instant case.

gold_text: . The record also contains answers to interrogatories and an affidavit by Marta in which she also states that her father insisted on the transfer. This Court, however, cannot consider her answers or affidavit with respect to this assertion because it is not clear that Marta has personal knowledge of any agreement between her brother and father with respect to this transaction. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); Akin v. Q-L Investments, Inc., 959 F.2d 521, 530 (5th Cir.1992); Garside v. Oseo Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir.1990). In the interrogatories, Marta did execute a statement declaring that she has personal knowledge of all facts contained therein, but her answers also state Hugo provided her with information to complete the answers. Given the inconsistencies of these statements and no comparable declaration of personal knowledge in the affidavit, this Court cannot consider those materials.
