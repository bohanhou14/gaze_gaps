Based on the provided reference cases and the analysis presented, it is clear that the legal cases are distinct and require separate consideration. The first case, Reference case 26 L. Ed. 187, involves a conspiracy to defraud, while the second case, Reference case 34 L. Ed. 1054, concerns a conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States.

In the first case, the court ruled that the conspiracy to defraud did not constitute a crime under the second clause of section 5440, as the means used were not criminal or unlawful. The court relied on the common law definition of conspiracy, which requires that the means used be criminal or unlawful, and that the end intended by the conspirators must involve moral turpitude of the basest sort.

In the second case, the court considered whether the amended section 4746, which penalizes the making or aiding the making of false or fraudulent affidavits, declarations, or other papers, applied to pension matters or other matters within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Pensions or the Secretary of the Interior. The court held that the amended section 4746 must be taken as applicable only to pension matters or claim for bounty land, and that the broad language in the section cannot be taken to cover everything within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner or Secretary.

In conclusion, the two cases present distinct legal issues and require separate analysis. The first case highlights the importance of considering the means used in a conspiracy, while the second case emphasizes the need to carefully construe the language of a statute to ensure that it is applied consistently with its intended purpose. <answer>

gold_text: We come then to consider how we shall understand the section in this particular: “pertaining to any other matter within the jurisdiction * * * of the Secretary of the Interior.” The indictment charges that the false filings, declarations, affidavits, certificates, papers, and writings used in each particular entry was a matter and proceeding before the register and receiver within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior. The register and receiver are not subordinate officers to the Secretary, in the sense that they act for him and perform duties incumbent on him. They are not his agents. They hold office under appointment by the President. They discharge duties fixed on them by statute. Their findings in some cases are final; in others there is a right of appeal to the Commissioner of the Band Office and from his rulings to the Secretary. What is meant by “jurisdiction” as here used? Its prime conception is one of power. When used in a political sense, it means governmental authority; such as when we say, the federal government has jurisdiction over navigable waters and interstate commerce, such as when we say,, a state has jurisdiction over affairs purely local. The section does not use the phrase “within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior” in that sense. That would smack too much of that imperialism, when the spirit of the Caesars brooded over a vast -empire, from whose capital city an impending hand reached out to its remotest confines. The word “jurisdiction,” must be here used in its legal sense, meaning authority to hear and determine a cause. Daniels v. Tearney, 102 U. S. 415, 418, 26 L. Ed. 187; Simmons v. Saul, 138 U. S. 439, 454, 11 Sup. Ct. 369, 34 L. Ed. 1054. But in determining whether the Secretary had authority to hear and determine the matters charged to have been presented to the register and receiver, other statutes must be considered. He could not of his own motion take the matter then pending in the local land office to himself for decision. It could only reach him, if at all, by a process of appeal, as provided by statute. It is not charged that the matter was appealed to him. Indeed, it was tacitly admitted in argument that the matters progressed no further than where they were first lodged in the local land office with the register and receiver. In no event is jurisdiction acquired by a court or officer on whom the law confers the power, until the power so given is exercised or invoked by an interested party. To hold that the Secretary had jurisdiction of the matters charged in the indictment would be to liken jurisdiction in its legal sense to jurisdiction in its political sense, which cannot be done under this statute. I think it clearly appears that the matters charged in the indictment were not within the jurisdiction of the Secretary as contemplated in section 4746.
