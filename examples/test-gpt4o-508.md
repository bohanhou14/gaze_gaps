11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4)
Bankruptcy Code § 523(a)(4) provides that a debt is not dischargeable if it arises from "fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny." In the context of bankruptcy, larceny is proven if the debtor has wrongfully and with fraudulent intent taken property from its owner (934 F.2d 901).

To establish nondischargeability under § 523(a)(4) for larceny, the plaintiff must prove:
1. The debtor wrongfully took property.
2. The debtor took the property with fraudulent intent.
3. The property belonged to another.

As referenced in 934 F.2d 901, a state law standard differentiates between the fraudulent intent required for larceny and that for embezzlement. The court in "In re Rose" inferred fraudulent intent from actions such as ignoring instructions about the use of funds (934 F.2d 901).

In this case, Mortensen's withdrawal of funds for personal expenses, combined with the absence of invoices substantiating those expenses, demonstrates he wrongfully took Little Family’s property with fraudulent intent. Specifically, the withdrawals for non-construction related expenses, such as the beauty salon and cruise payments, indicate a misappropriation meeting the larceny criteria under § 523(a)(4).

The judgment in "In re Nahabedian" (87 B.R. 214) similarly emphasizes that when funds are used contrary to an agreement, it corroborates wrongful and fraudulent takings. Therefore, funds totaling $29,844.00 were not used for construction expenses as agreed and should be deemed nondischargeable under § 523(a)(4).

The court concludes that Mortensen’s obligations from the misappropriated funds are nondischargeable as they result from larceny.

gold_text: A Chapter 7 discharge does not discharge debt for embezzlement or larceny. 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4). Little Family argues the two claims alternatively, conceding that they are inconsistent claims. Larceny is the wrongful taking of property from the rightful owner with fraudulent intent to convert the property to the debt- or’s own use. Kaye v. Rose (Matter of Rose), 934 F.2d 901, 903 (7th Cir.1991); Dynamic Food Service Equipment, Inc. v. Stern (In re Stern), 231 B.R. 25, 26 (S.D.N.Y.1999). Embezzlement is the “fraudulent appropriation of property of another by a person to whom such property has been entrusted or into whose hands it has lawfully come.” First National Bank of Fayetteville, Arkansas v. Phillips (In re Phillips), 882 F.2d 302, 304 (8th Cir.1989). The funds at issue were deposited into a bank account in Mortensen’s name. He was authorized to use the funds in the construction of the Little Family homes. Therefore, the claim of larceny will be dismissed, and the § 523(a)(4) claim will be analyzed under the theory of embezzlement.
