In the reference case 171 F.3d 195, the court determined that the district court's determination that 1.5 kilograms of crack were attributable to Jeron through Midgette was not clearly erroneous. Similarly, in the case at hand, the court can determine the amount of crack attributable to Calloway and Sander based on the evidence presented.

The court can consider the evidence of Calloway's involvement in the conspiracy, including his role as an organizer and his possession of large quantities of crack. The court can also consider the evidence of Sander's involvement, including her admission that she bought crack from Calloway on a regular basis and that she drove him to Atlanta to obtain drugs.

In addition, the court can consider the evidence of the confidential informant's testimony, which described the large quantities of crack sold by Calloway and Sander. The court can also consider the evidence of the police officers' testimony, which described the discovery of crack and other drug-related items in Calloway's car.

Based on the evidence presented, the court can determine the amount of crack attributable to Calloway and Sander and impose a sentence accordingly. This determination will be based on the court's findings of fact, including the amount of crack possessed and distributed by the defendants, and the court's application of the relevant sentencing guidelines.

In conclusion, the court can use the evidence presented to determine the amount of crack attributable to Calloway and Sander and impose a sentence accordingly. This determination will be based on the court's findings of fact and the application of the relevant sentencing guidelines. The court will consider the evidence of the defendants' involvement in the conspiracy, including their role as organizers and their possession of large quantities of crack. The court will also consider the evidence of the confidential informant's testimony and the police officers' testimony.
