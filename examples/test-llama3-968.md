The case presented involves a challenge to a collective bargaining agreement between the Missouri-Pacific Railroad and the International Association of Railway Employees (IARE) regarding the mandatory retirement age of black firemen on the DeQuincy Division. The agreement, negotiated and executed in 1964, required black firemen to retire at age 65, while white firemen could continue working until age 70. The plaintiffs, six black firemen, sued the Railroad under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging that the agreement violated their rights under the Act.

The District Court found that the Railroad had discriminated against the black firemen in the past, and that the age 65 agreement was the present effect of that discrimination. The court awarded the plaintiffs back wages
