In the case of United States v. Fletcher, the defendants, Calvert H. and N. Karene Fletcher, appealed their convictions for conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. The defendants argued that the statute of limitations had expired and that the trial court erred in giving jury instructions on knowledge of the unlawful aims of the conspiracy.

The court held that the statute of limitations did not expire, citing Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391, 397-98 (1957), which stated that the limitations period begins to run after the last overt act in furtherance of the main goals of the conspiracy. The court found that the execution of the promissory note and the escrow stock agreement on April 5, 1983, were overt acts that furthered the conspiracy's main goals.

Regarding the jury instructions, the court held that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on the defendants' knowledge of the unlawful aims of the conspiracy. The court cited United States v. Lanza, 790 F.2d 1015, 1022 (2d Cir. 1986), which stated that a conscious avoidance charge is appropriate where the knowledge of the fraudulent goals of a conspiracy is at issue. The court also found that the evidence presented at trial, including the defendants' use of aliases and the commingling of funds, supported the inference that the defendants consciously avoided knowing the conspiracy's fraudulent purpose.

The court also addressed the defendants' claim that the trial court erred in excluding expert testimony from a certified public accountant. The court held that the trial court had broad discretion to determine relevancy and that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the risk of confusion to the jury.

In conclusion, the court affirmed the defendants' convictions, holding that the statute of limitations did not expire and that the jury instructions and exclusion of evidence were proper. The court cited several reference cases, including Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391 (1957), United States v. Lanza, 790 F.2d 1015 (2d Cir. 1986), and United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285 (2d Cir. 1991).

gold_text: We see no basis to disturb the district court’s ruling on the proffered testimony of the defense expert. The proffer was made after the testimony of Quirini, Morrison and Mrs. Fletcher but before that of Fletcher. At the time of the proffer, there was no testimony as to any foreign corporations and Quirini, Morrison and Mrs. Fletcher had testified that no money had been placed in trust accounts. Later, while Fletcher testified that the use of foreign corporations and trusts had been discussed by the conspirators and that, in substance, such use had lawful tax advantages, he testified that he did not have a trust account or own a corporation in the Bahamas. In view of this testimony, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding largely irrelevant evidence as to foreign trust tax effects in the United States that ceased to exist four years prior to the time of the acts alleged in the indictment and as to foreign corporation tax consequences which were not at issue in this case. The district court was not “manifestly erroneous” in excluding the proffered testimony as irrelevant under Fed.R.Evid. 401, United States v. Diaz, 878 F.2d 608, 616 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 110 S.Ct. 543, 107 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989); United States v. Kraeger, 711 F.2d 6, 7-8 (2d Cir.1983), especially because explaining the tax law is generally within the purview of the court, not expert witnesses. See, e.g., Kraeger, 711 F.2d at 7-8. Nor did the district court compromise the fifth amendment’s guarantee of due process. See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1436, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986); United States v. Corr, 543 F.2d 1042, 1051 (2d Cir.1976). The district court also did not err in excluding the expert evidence pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 702. The most such evidence could have done would have been to lend credence to Fletcher’s claim, fully presented to the jury, that when foreign trusts and foreign corporations owned by United States citizens were discussed, he believed there were lawful tax advantages to such vehicles. But this marginal assistance to Fletcher would likely have contributed to jury confusion, not enlightenment, in view of Fletcher’s testimony that he did not have a trust account or own a corporation in the Bahamas. Rule 702 predicates the admissibility of expert testimony on its assisting the jury. The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the Palmer testimony in this case.
