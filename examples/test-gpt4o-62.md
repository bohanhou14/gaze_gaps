In light of the issues raised in defendant Juan Jimenez’s motion, it is necessary to address the pertinent legal precedents regarding the waiver of the right to counsel during deportation proceedings. 

In Montilla v. INS, the Second Circuit established that an alien claiming the INS failed to adhere to its own regulations need not demonstrate prejudice to obtain relief (926 F.2d 162, 167-69). This standard emphasizes that, as long as the regulations were designed to benefit the alien and were not followed, relief is warranted (Id. at 169). However, the distinction between Montilla and the current case lies in the nature of the rights and the context examined. Montilla dealt with the waiver of the right to counsel, considered a fundamental right under the Sixth Amendment and aligned with the Fifth Amendment due process (994 F.2d 71).

Here, although Judge Page's coercive remarks during the defendant’s deportation hearing indeed violated due process, resulting in the defendant's waiver of counsel and appeal rights as involuntary, subsequent examination reveals no prejudice. According to Fares, despite procedural irregularities, the requirement for a collateral challenge includes showing that those irregularities resulted in fundamental unfairness and possible relief (978 F.2d 52, 57).

Given defendant’s aggravated felony convictions, statutory grounds precluded relief from deportation, establishing no fundamental unfairness (8 U.S.C. § 1254(a)(2), § 1254(e)). Additionally, the potential for a habeas attack on narcotics convictions lacks substantiation in the evidence presented. Consequently, despite the procedural shortcomings, the defendant has not demonstrated prejudice that would invalidate the previous deportation order. Therefore, the motion to preclude the use of the 1994 deportation order is denied.

gold_text: . Delendanl relics on two opinions, Montilla v. ÍNS, 926 F.2d 162 (2d Cir.1991) ("Montilla") and Waldron v. INS, 994 F.2d 71 (2d Cir.1993) ("Waldron I ”), for the proposition that there is no requirement that a fundamental error be prejudicial in order for a motion to suppress such as this one to succeed. Defendant misapprehends the law in this area. Montilla is inapposite because it applies only in the context of a direct appeal Irom a deportation order. Fares, decided after Mantilla, clearly established the law in this circuit with regard to collateral attacks such as this one and Fares requires a finding of prejudice.
