Furthermore, plaintiff's complain that prison officials threatened punishment for filing grievances is particularly troubling. Such actions, if proven, could justify injunctive relief, as prisoner access to the courts must not be restricted through intimidation or coercion (460 F.2d 765). The allegations of being prevented from receiving or providing legal assistance resonate with the established principle that reasonable alternatives must be provided to assist inmates with legal matters if mutual aid is prohibited among prisoners (393 U.S. 483). Additionally, while States may impose reasonable restrictions on mutual assistance among prisoners, any outright deprivation without alternatives would contravene constitutional protections (393 U.S. 483). Plaintiff's detailed recount of the prison officials' refusal to allow telephone access strengthens his claim under the Sixth Amendment, highlighting an infringement on his right to legal counsel, and thus warrants further examination under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

gold_text: The prisoner’s right of access to the courts was firmly established in Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969). It has subsequently been interpreted to mean that the state may not hinder a prisoner in his preparation of legal papers, . or impede his correspondence with courts, lawyers, or even law book publishers.Prison officials may not confiscate an inmate’s lawbooks, and may not impose any sanction for engaging in legal activities on his own behalf or for the benefit of fellow inmates. See generally, Corby v. Conboy, 457 F.2d 261 (2d Cir. 1972); Campbell v. Beto, 460 F.2d 765 (5th Cir. 1972). It has been recognized, furthermore, that the right of unimpeded access to courts implies a similar right of access to legal assistance. In Wells v. McGinnis, 344 F.Supp. 594 (S.D.N.Y.1972), Judge Gurfein held that a prisoner’s contention that the prison was interfering with his correspondence with his lawyer was sufficient to state a cause of action under § 1983. He deemed this contention a “serious charge”, and noted that “channels of communication between a prisoner and his counsel must be kept open.” I agree with this observation, and find it equally applicable to the allegations plaintiff has made here. Plaintiff has not been guilty of such conduct as to cause the revocation of his privileges, and I can find no reason why a phone call to his lawyer should not have been permitted. Since such calls are apparently permitted generally, no extraordinary procedures need have been invoked nor any disciplinary schemes disrupted. Under these circumstances, the refusal to allow communication with a lawyer would be violative of the Sixth Amendment if plaintiff can prove this refusal at trial.
