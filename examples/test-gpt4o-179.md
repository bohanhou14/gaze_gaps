Both state court judgments under consideration are undoubtedly nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5) and § 523(a)(15). The Defendant's assertion that the amounts related to occupancy of the marital residence constitute penalties rather than support obligations is without merit. As stated in the court rulings, these judgments were intended to provide economic security and well-being to the Plaintiff and her children, aligning with the interpretation found in previous cases where courts have protected spousal and child support obligations from discharge (290 B.R. 479). Further, the argument regarding the procedural requirement for awarding attorneys' fees directly to the Plaintiff's attorneys fails since any attempt to reverse or modify this aspect would fall under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, prohibiting lower federal courts from reviewing state court judgments (159 F.3d 687).

Hence, based on case law precedents and statutory provisions, the substantial evidence supports that the debts arising from the occupancy charges and attorney's fees awarded are nondischargeable. Accordingly, the Plaintiff's request to classify these judgments as nondischargeable will be granted.

gold_text: While the Defendant seeks to characterize the $150 a day amounts awarded under the $861,924.94 Judgment as a penalty and not a support obligation, the Court finds this argument to be irrelevant to the Court’s determination of dis-chargeability under 11 U.S.C. § 523. First, Referee Gibson addressed the Defendant’s argument in his confirmed reports and found that the $150 a day provision in the Divorce Judgment was not a penalty and the Divorce Judgment was never appealed. Thus, it is res judicata and enforceable. In addition, this Court is required to give full faith and credit to the state court Judgments under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. “The Rooker-Feld-man doctrine provides that the lower federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over a case if the exercise of jurisdiction over that case would result in the reversal or modification of a state court judgment. Such jurisdiction is lacking because within the federal system, only the Supreme Court may review a state court judgment.” Hachamovüch v. DeBuono, 159 F.3d 687, 693 (2d Cir.1998). The validity and enforceability of the Judgments are not for this Court to decide. In re Salem, 290 B.R. 479, 482 (S.D.N.Y.2003). The only issue before this Court is not whether the state court Judgments were correctly decided but whether they are dischargeable in whole or in part under 11 U.S.C. §§ 523(a)(5) and/or (a)(15).
