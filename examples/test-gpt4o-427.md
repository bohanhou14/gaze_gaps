The imposition and subsequent violations of the Jefferson decree by the Noxubee County School District underline the persistent challenges facing the enforcement of desegregation orders. In our previous rulings, United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education, 5 Cir., 1966, 372 F.2d 836, and its reaffirmation en banc, 1967, 380 F.2d 385, this Court emphasized the necessity of removing discriminatory practices to create an integrated education system. The actions of several appellees clearly demonstrate attempts to undermine these judicial mandates.

Appellee Lanier's threats and economic coercion closely align with previously identified patterns of interference that merit injunctive relief, as outlined in both referenced cases (372 F.2d 836, 380 F.2d 385). His actions, particularly the direct threats to job security and economic repercussions, are in direct conflict with the principles of equality and nondiscrimination upheld by this Court and the Supreme Court.

Similarly, appellee Hillâ€™s intimidating behavior, notably his explicit threats and display of a weapon, represents a clear strategy to obstruct the desegregation process, as recognized in our prior decisions. The coercion of vulnerable African American families to withdraw their children from white schools starkly contravenes the affirmative duties established under Brown v. Board of Education and subsequent rulings.

Therefore, consistent with our jurisprudence and precedents set forth in 372 F.2d 836 and 380 F.2d 385, the lower court's dismissal of injunctive relief is reversed for all appellees except Dinsmore and Hurst. The District Court is directed to issue the necessary injunctions to prevent further obstruction of desegregation efforts.
