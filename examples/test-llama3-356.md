This case involves a deputy constable, Salvador Perez, who was charged with defrauding Rosa Maria Hinojosa and her relatives by accepting money to help them obtain an early release from prison. The prosecution's evidence showed that Perez had accepted $1,600 from Hinojosa to help her relatives, and that he had made false promises to her and others about his ability to secure their release.

Perez appealed his conviction, arguing that the evidence was insufficient and that the trial court had erred in excluding certain evidence. Specifically, he argued that the court had excluded evidence of witness bias and political motivations, which he claimed were relevant to the case.

In U.S. v. Williams, 623 F.2d 418, the court held that a defendant's failure to renew a motion for acquittal at the end of the evidence waives the issue of sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, absent a "manifest miscarriage of justice." In this case, Perez did not renew his motion for acquittal, so the court applied the waiver doctrine and found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.

Perez also argued that the trial court had erred in excluding evidence of witness bias and political motivations. However, in U.S. v. White, 611 F.2d 531, the court held that the trial court has a wide discretion to exclude evidence that is irrelevant or cumulative, and that the court's decision to exclude such evidence will not be disturbed on appeal unless it was an abuse of discretion. In this case, the court found that the trial court had not abused its discretion in excluding the evidence of witness bias and political motivations.

Finally, Perez argued that the trial court had failed to swear an interpreter who had translated questions to and answers of two crucial prosecution witnesses. However, in U.S. v. Love, 599 F.2d 107, the court held that the failure to swear an interpreter is not necessarily reversible error, especially where the record shows that counsel did not object to the omission at the time.

In conclusion, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, and that the trial court had not erred in excluding evidence of witness bias and political motivations or in failing to swear an interpreter. The conviction was affirmed.

gold_text: Finally, Perez objects that the evidence is insufficient to sustain one element common to all those counts of which he was convicted: that the telephone calls made to Perez furthered his scheme to defraud Rosa Hinojosa. In view of the failure of Perez to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence, our review pursuant to this complaint is limited to preventing a manifest miscarriage of justice.
