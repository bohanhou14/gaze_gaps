In this case, Mays contends that he unequivocally invoked his right to counsel during the interrogation, which the detectives ignored. The Supreme Court has firmly established that to invoke the right to counsel, a suspect must do so unambiguously (Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 459 (1994)). A suspect’s ambiguous or equivocal mention of counsel does not require police to end the interrogation or even to ask clarifying questions (Id. at 460, 461–462).

In Smith v. Illinois, 469 U.S. 91, it was underscored that courts must determine whether the accused actually invoked their right to counsel, relying on clear and unequivocal assertions. Additionally, commentaries on this standard note that if the accused fails to make a sufficiently clear invocation, questioning may proceed (Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 433 n.4 (1986)).

In Mays’s case, his statement, “I really should have a lawyer, huh?” was not a clear and unequivocal request necessitating cessation of the interview. The district court aptly cited Mays’s additional commentary, stating that he thought lawyers were a waste of money, which supported the conclusion that his remarks were neither clear nor unambiguous requests for counsel (602 F.3d 381).

Thus, following the established precedents such as Davis and Smith, we find no Fifth Amendment violation in the detectives’ decision to continue the interrogation after Mays’s ambiguous remark.

gold_text: The consequence of such a “ ‘rigid’ prophylactic rule” is that courts require a suspect to “unambiguously request counsel.” Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 458-59, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994). “[A] statement either is such an assertion [of the right to counsel] or it is not.” Smith v. Illinois, 469 U.S. 91, 97-98, 105 S.Ct. 490, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984) (second alteration in original) (citation omitted). We have held that “a suspect must assert his [right to counsel] with sufficient clarity that a reasonable officer would perceive it as such under the circumstances.” Franklin v. Bradshaw, 545 F.3d 409, 414 (6th Cir. 2008) (citing United States v. Hurst, 228 F.3d 751, 759 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that the Davis standard for invocation applies equally to the right to counsel and the right to remain silent)); see also Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U.S. 370, 381, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010) (holding that “there is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to counsel”). “Simply mentioning the prospect of talking with an attorney, or waiting to talk until one is present, is not sufficient to put the agent on notice that a suspect has invoked his right to remain silent” or his right to an attorney. United States v. Amawi, 695 F.3d 457, 485 (6th Cir. 2012). Thus, where a suspect merely “makes an ambiguous or equivocal reference to an attorney[,] there is no requirement that law enforcement cease questioning.” Ibid, (quoting United States v. Montes, 602 F.3d 381, 385 (5th Cir. 2010)).
