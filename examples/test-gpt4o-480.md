To evaluate sufficiency of the evidence supporting petitioner's conviction for second-degree murder, this Court adopts the standard outlined in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979). Under Jackson, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt (443 U.S. at 319). This standard emphasizes the responsibility of the trier of fact to resolve conflicts in testimony, weigh evidence, and draw reasonable inferences (see also reference cases 920 F.2d 345, 788 F.2d 400, 972 F.2d 675, 752 F.2d 1142).

In the present case, petitioner was seen arguing with the victim, returning with a sawed-off shotgun, and subsequently shooting the victim in the head after trying to get him outside. Multiple witnesses corroborated these events (T I at 142-145, 157-158). Given this evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational jury could indeed find the essential elements of second-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, petitioner's claim of insufficient evidence fails.

Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 324, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2792, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); United States v.

The Court must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine if each element of the crime was established beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. The fact that the evidence was circumstantial does not render it insufficient. Spalla v. Foltz, 788 F.2d 400, 402 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 935, 107 S.Ct. 410, 93 L.Ed.2d 362 (1986). Furthermore, “[i]t is the province of the factfinder ... to weigh the probative value of the evidence and resolve any conflicts in the testimony.” Neal v.
