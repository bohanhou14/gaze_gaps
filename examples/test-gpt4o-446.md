We are guided by well-established precedents that necessitate a pragmatic and flexible approach to conflict of laws issues, particularly when adjudicating cases with significant interstate elements, as elucidated in Kilberg. A pertinent reference is found in the teachings of Haag v. Barnes, 9 N.Y.2d 554, 216 N.Y.S.2d 65, 175 N.E.2d 441 (1961), which explores the broad policy concerns underlying the choice-of-law doctrines related to contracts. This aligns closely with our decision in Pearson v. Northeast Airlines, Inc., where the essential inquiry revolves around the legitimate interests of the forum state, New York, as opposed to an inflexible adherence to Massachusetts' statute.

In Global Commerce Corp., S.A. v. Clark-Babbitt Industries, Inc., 239 F.2d 716, 719 (2nd Cir. 1956), and similar rulings, the courts have consistently acknowledged that states with substantial contacts to the transaction may elect to apply their own substantive laws, even where the cause of action originates from another state. Furthermore, our examination parallels the reasoning in Zogg v. Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co., 276 F.2d 861, 864 (2nd Cir. 1960), wherein the court emphasized a grouping of significant contacts in determining applicable law while considering the broader statutory and policy implications, something New York has prudently adhered to in Kilberg.

In summation, drawing on ample judicial authorities, including Reese and Kaufman's discussions on pragmatic legal applications (see reference in 299 F.2d 696), we reaffirm that New York’s approach—balancing its own policy with Massachusetts’ foundational liability statute—complies with both Full Faith and Credit and Due Process Clauses. Thus, the judgment of the District Court, as appropriately modified on interest, stands affirmed.
