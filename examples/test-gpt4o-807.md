Given the facts at hand, the Rand's status as a vessel is clearly supported by historical and legal precedents. For instance, in Kathriner v. Unisea, Inc., the definition of a vessel under 1 U.S.C. § 3 was reaffirmed, which includes any watercraft capable of being used as a means of transportation on water (975 F.2d 657, 662). The Rand possesses this capacity even if its engines are inoperable, similar to the scenarios in Pleason and Campbell where towed crafts without functional engines were still classified as vessels (see Pleason v. Gulfport Shipbuilding Corp., 221 F.2d 621, and Campbell v. Loznicka, 181 F.2d 356).

More specifically, the structural integrity and potential residual capacity for navigation, as highlighted in Kathriner, reiterate that even seemingly non-navigable structures can still be deemed vessels if they meet certain criteria. This interpretation aligns with another case from the same Circuit where the statute's definition was broadly analyzed (97 F.3d 603).

Thus, given that the Rand floated independently, had spud poles only loosely securing it, and retained some navigational equipment, it falls within the statutory definition of a "vessel." Consequently, the appellants’ convictions should be reversed as the discharges from the Rand do not fall under the criminal provisions of the Clean Water Act.

gold_text: The government also cites Kathriner v. UNISEA, Inc., 975 F.2d 657, 660 (9th Cir.1992), for support. In Kathriner, the Ninth Circuit ruled the UNISEA, a former liberty ship converted into a floating fish processing plant, was not a “vessel in navigation” under the Jones Act because it was permanently moored and had no movement capabilities, and had no means of navigation, no independent source of propulsion, and no transportation function at all. Id. Just as with West Indies, Kathri-ner is distinguishable. First, the definition of “vessel in navigation” under the Jones Act is not as expansive as the general definition of “vessel.” Compare Morehead v. Atkinson-Kiewit. J/V, 97 F.3d 603, 607 (1st Cir.1996) (noting the general definition of “vessel,” under 1 U.S.C. § 3 “is significantly more inclusive than that used for evaluating seaman status under the Jones Act”), with Kathriner, 975 F.2d at 659, 662 (stating seaman status under the Jones Act requires a plaintiff prove he was aboard a “vessel in navigation,” and observing the definition from 1 U.S.C. § 3 is the one most courts use for purposes of the LHWCA). The present case does not present us with the question of whether the Rand was a “vessel in navigation” under the Jones Act. Furthermore, the UNI-SEA had permanent utility connections and was “designed as a floating factory-merely extending land over water for the purpose of increasing the usable space of a dock-side fish processing operation,” and “when the UNISEA was converted to a shrimp processing plant, a large opening was cut into her hull to allow for dock traffic,” and if put to sea, “she would surely sink.” Id. at 660. The Rand, in contrast, was attached to two spud poles by eighteen bolts, which could easily be removed, permitting the Rand to be towed because she floated on her own, which is sufficient to bestow “vessel” status on her.
