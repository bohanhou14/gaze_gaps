DONOVAN, District Judge.
In assessing Dairy's claim for a deduction based on the depreciation of the bottling contract, it is prudent to consider pertinent case law. The principle established in 205 F.2d 538 emphasizes the accurate reporting of proceeds and the need for clear allocation of purchase agreements for tax purposes. Similar to the taxpayer in that case, Dairy must demonstrate precise allocations to succeed in its claim.

Moreover, referencing 243 F.2d 584, the presumption of correctness lies with the Commissioner's findings unless convincingly rebutted by compelling evidence. This presumption underscores the necessity for Dairy to provide unequivocal proof that the $30,000 allocation in its purchase agreement warrants depreciation. The principles from these cases guide the Court in requiring Dairy to substantiate its depreciation claims convincingly, considering both the tangible and intangible aspects of the assets involved.

Given the evidence and legal precedents, Dairy's argument that the $20,000 allocated to the bottling contract qualifies for depreciation has not met the necessary burden of proof. Consequently, the Court concludes that the claimed deduction is unwarranted under the statutory requirements.

Defendant may submit findings of fact, conclusions of law, and form of judgment. Plaintiff is allowed an exception. Dairy relies on 28 U.S.C.A. ยง 1346, and 26 U.S.C.A. ยง 23(Z).
