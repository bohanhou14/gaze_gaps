The case before us is a complex one, with a lengthy judicial history that warrants a thorough examination. The case involves a condemnation proceeding filed by the Puerto Rico Housing Authority against the condemnee, seeking to take possession of certain property for the development of a low-rental housing project.

In this case, we are asked to review the decision of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, which held that the condemnee's motion to restore title to the property was properly denied. The condemnee argues that the repeal of § 7 of the Eminent Domain Act, which allowed for the restoration of title to the property if the condemnor failed to utilize the property within a certain period, was unconstitutional as it deprived her of due process of law.

However, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico concluded that the repeal of § 7 did not have a retroactive effect on the condemnee's rights, as she had not acquired any vested right to restore title to the property prior to the repeal. The court relied on the principle that retroactive legislation is constitutional when it does not deprive a person of a completely vested right (Ettor v. City of Tacoma, 1913, 228 U.S. 148, 33 S.Ct. 428, 57 L.Ed. 773).

Furthermore, the court noted that the condemnee did not change her position in reliance upon § 7, as she did not voluntarily convey the property in the assurance that she could reacquire it if the condemnor did not complete the public work within the statutory period. Therefore, the court concluded that the repeal of § 7 did not deprive the condemnee of due process of law.

In conclusion, we affirm the decision of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, holding that the repeal of § 7 did not have a retroactive effect on the condemnee's rights, and that the condemnee did not acquire any vested right to restore title to the property prior to the repeal. This decision is in line with the principle established in reference case 324 U.S. 229, that retroactive legislation is constitutional when it does not deprive a person of a completely vested right.

gold_text: This is a reasonable interpretation of § 7 with which we cannot interfere. De Castro v. Board of Commissioners, supra. The phrase “final decision” is not a term of art having only a single, unvarying meaning; the interpretation put upon it must be suited to the context in which it is used. The “final decision” from which an appeal may be taken, as the phrase is used in statutes defining appellate jurisdiction, must necessarily be the decision of a lower tribunal. See Catlin v. United States, 1945, 324 U.S. 229, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911; Jimenez v. Jones, 1 Cir., 1952, 195 F.2d 159. The “final decision” contemplated by § 7, on the other hand, may more plausibly be regarded as the judgment of condemnation from the moment it becomes invulnerable to possible upset on appellate review. Otherwise the condemning authority, in order to avoid loss of the property for lack of use while appellate litigation is pending, might find it necessary to proceed with the public work even though its right to condemn had not been finally adjudicated. The history of this very case is persuasive of the reasonableness of the interpretation adopted.
