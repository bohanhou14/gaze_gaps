Defendant has also moved for summary judgment on plaintiff’s hostile work environment claim. To prevail on a hostile work environment claim, a plaintiff must show that the workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive working environment. See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21-22 (1993). Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment — one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive — is beyond Title VII’s purview. See 523 U.S. 75, referencing Harris, 510 U.S., at 21.

Here, defendant argues that Lin failed to demonstrate that the alleged conduct was either severe or pervasive enough to meet the high threshold required for a hostile work environment claim. The Supreme Court in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75, emphasized that the objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position, considering all the circumstances, including the social context in which particular behavior occurs. Following this doctrine, the Court finds that Lin’s allegations, such as disfavor from Officer Freedman or specific comments made by Officer Evans, while potentially boorish or inappropriate, do not rise to the level of altering the conditions of his employment as required.

Furthermore, Lin did not avail himself of the opportunities the employer provided to address the alleged harassment. In Faragher v. City of Boca Raton and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 775, the Court established that an employer could assert an affirmative defense by showing that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassment and that the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventative or corrective opportunities. Defendant has shown that it had appropriate anti-harassment policies in place and that Lin did not fully utilize these measures.

Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Lin, no reasonable jury could find that the workplace was so permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, or insult as to alter the conditions of his employment. Accordingly, defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the hostile work environment claim will be granted.

gold_text: Employers may not create or condone a hostile work environment. Such an environment exists “[w]hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive working environment.” Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 78, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, the “key terms ... are ‘severe,’ ‘pervasive,’ and ‘abusive,’ as not just any offensive or discriminatory conduct rises to an actionable hostile work environment.” Nurriddin v. Bolden, 674 F.Supp.2d 64, 93 (D.D.C.2009). In Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, the Supreme Court articulated “demanding” standards for a hostile work environment claim, meant to “filter out complaints attacking the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing,” thus ensuring that “Title VII does not become a general civility code.” 524 U.S. 775, 787, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under Faragher, in determining whether an environment is “sufficiently hostile or abusive” to be “both objectively and subjectively offensive” enough to be actionable, the Court looks at “all of the circumstances,” including: (1) the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or merely offensive; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee’s performance. Id. at 787-88, 118 S.Ct. 2275.
