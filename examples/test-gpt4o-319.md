This conclusion aligns with precedent set in similar cases where habeas corpus petitions were filed before exhausting military appellate remedies. In *Breitenstein v. Gorko*, 314 F.2d 858, the court underscored the necessity of completing the military appeals process before seeking habeas relief, particularly when alleging violations of rights under the UCMJ. Similarly, in *Ex parte Hawk*, 321 U.S. 114, and as affirmed in the case of *U.S. v. Sing Tack*, 194 U.S. 161, military-related petitions for habeas corpus must demonstrate that all available military remedies have been exhausted. Additionally, in *Johnson v. Hoy*, 227 U.S. 245, the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts should refrain from intervening in military cases prior to the exhaustion of military judicial avenues, a stance reaffirmed in *Ex parte Kusweski*, 251 F. 977.

In the present case, parallels can be drawn to the rulings in *Breitenstein* and *Ex parte Hawk*, where courts held that procedural diligence in military tribunals must precede any federal habeas corpus filings. Moreover, as emphasized in *179 F.2d 661*, the binding nature of military judicial decisions must be respected unless all appellate opportunities within the military justice system have been fully pursued. In light of these precedents, it is evident that appellant's failure to exhaust military remedies renders this habeas corpus petition premature.

Accordingly, the district court's order is vacated, and the judgment is reversed, requiring appellant to adhere to the statutory military appellate procedures outlined in the UCMJ before seeking federal court intervention.
