The court's conclusion is that the debtors have the burden of showing that they are unable to repay their student loans and that the loans would cause an undue hardship if not discharged. The court finds that the debtors have met this burden and that the loans would cause an undue hardship if not discharged.

The court's analysis is based on the Brunner test, which requires that the debtors show that they have made a good faith effort to repay the loans, that they are unable to repay the loans, and that the loans would cause an undue hardship if not discharged. The court finds that the debtors have made a good faith effort to repay the loans, but are unable to do so due to their financial circumstances.

The court also notes that the debtors have a high debt-to-income ratio and that their income is not sufficient to cover their expenses, including their student loan payments. The court finds that the debtors are not able to repay the loans and that the loans would cause an undue hardship if not discharged.

The court's decision is supported by the case law, including In re Brunner, 46 B.R. 752 (S.D.N.Y.1985), aff'd 831 F.2d 395 (2d Cir.1987), which held that a debtor's inability to repay a student loan is a factor to be considered in determining whether the loan would cause an undue hardship if not discharged. The court also notes that the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel has held that a debtor's financial circumstances, including their income and expenses, are relevant factors in determining whether a student loan would cause an undue hardship if not discharged.

In conclusion, the court finds that the debtors have met the burden of showing that they are unable to repay their student loans and that the loans would cause an undue hardship if not discharged. The court

gold_text: This Court has not decided whether it is truly “bound” by the decisions of this Circuit’s B.A.P., another issue dividing the courts. While the issue has been decided in the affirmative by this Circuit’s B.A.P. in the case of In re Windmill Farms, Inc., 70 B.R. 618, 621 (9th Cir. BAP 1987), rev’d on other grounds, 841 F.2d 1467 (9th Cir.1988), other courts have held otherwise, In re Junes, 76 B.R. 795, 797 (Bankr.D.Or.1987), affd on oth er grounds, 99 B.R. 978 (9th Cir. BAP 1989). See Bank of Maui v. Estate of Analysis, Inc., 904 F.2d 470, 471 (9th Cir.1989). However, the Court declines the opportunity to use this case as a vehicle for undertaking such an analysis. Absent a clear conviction that the Panel’s interpretation of the statute is wrong, this Court will defer to the decision of the B.A.P. The parties, if they are so inclined, may address their arguments in favor of partial discharge to Congress or to the courts of the Circuit which are indisputably capable of establishing precedent. Since Taylor dictates that the Court take an “all or nothing” role in deciding the undue hardship issue, this Court is persuaded to side with the Plaintiffs under the facts of this case.
