The referenced cases provide valuable insights into the issues of judicial estoppel and objections to magistrate judges’ reports. In the case of 968 F.2d 298, the court held that a party must serve and file objections to a magistrate judge’s report within 10 days of being served with the report, and failure to do so waives any further judicial review. This rule is similar to the one mentioned in 9 F.3d 1049, which states that a party must file objections to a magistrate judge’s report within 10 days of being served with the report.

In the case of 838 F.2d 55, the court discussed the doctrine of judicial estoppel and its application in ADA cases. The court held that a party who represents in a disability application that they are disabled is judicially estopped from arguing that they are qualified to perform the duties of a position under the ADA. This doctrine is similar to the one mentioned in 714 F.2d 234, which states that a party who makes a sworn statement that they are disabled is judicially estopped from denying that statement in a later proceeding.

In the case of 474 U.S. 140, the court discussed the issue of objections to magistrate judges’ reports. The court held that a party must serve and file objections to a magistrate judge’s report within 10 days of being served with the report, and failure to do so waives any further judicial review. This rule is similar to the one mentioned in the other referenced cases.

In conclusion, the referenced cases provide valuable insights into the issues of judicial estoppel and objections to magistrate judges’ reports. The cases discussed the doctrine of judicial estoppel and its application in ADA cases, as well as the rules governing objections to magistrate judges’ reports. These cases can be useful in understanding the legal principles and rules that govern these issues.
