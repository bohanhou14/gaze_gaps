In 116 F.2d 718, it was established that when property is transferred to a corporation by issuance of stock, the basis of that property to the transferee is identical to its basis in the hands of the transferor. Therefore, in the present case, since the partnership had a zero basis in the accounts receivable, the corporate taxpayer must also maintain a zero basis, consistent with Section 362(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. This ruling confirms that the petitioner realized a gain upon collection of these accounts receivable.

Additionally, the decision in 61 T.C. 28 clarifies the treatment of accounts receivable transferred in a Section 351 transaction. The court in Peter Raich, 46 T.C. 604, emphasized that for cash method partnerships, the basis of accounts receivable remains zero, a principle applicable regardless of the business entity involved. This corroborates the government’s stance that the taxpayer's claim for a stepped-up basis is unfounded.

Thus, affirming both reference cases, it is evident that the transfer under Section 351 mandates the continuance of the transferor’s basis, leading to the realization of gain when receivables are collected. Consequently, the taxpayer's argument for an adjusted inventory basis and circumvention of the cash basis rule upon transfer is unsupported by precedent.

gold_text: . Du Pont v. United States, supra, at 1214, citing P. A. Birren & Son, Inc. v. Commissioner, 116 F.2d 718 (7th Cir. 1940), observed that nonrecognition under Section 351 has been granted for accounts receivable. In the recent case of Thatcher v. Commissioner, 61 T.C. 28 (42 U.S.L.W. 2228, October 30, 1973), the Tax Court reaffirmed its decision in Raich v. Commissioner, 46 T. C. 604 (1966), holding that accounts receivable transferred by a cash basis taxpayer to a corporation under Section 351 had a zero basis. By placing a tax basis in that which was transferred, the Tax Court by implication assumed that accounts receivable are “property” within the meaning of Section 351.
