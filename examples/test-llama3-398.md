This case involves a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, where the petitioner, Pedro F. Torres, claims that the jury instructions in his state court murder trial violated his due process rights by impermissibly shifting the burden of proof. The district court and the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed his conviction, and Torres brought this petition for writ of habeas corpus.

The issue before us is whether the jury instructions violated Torres's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. In this regard, we must consider whether the state court decision was "contrary to" or involved an "unreasonable application" of clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.

In Connecticut v. Johnson, 460 U. S. 73 (1983), the Supreme Court held that a defendant's due process rights are not violated by a jury instruction that impermissibly shifts the burden of proof, where the evidence is overwhelming and the instruction is harmless. Similarly, in 471 U.S. 307, the Court held that a jury instruction that impermissibly shifts the burden of proof is not necessarily a violation of due process, where the instruction is harmless and the evidence is overwhelming.

In this case, the jury instructions did not violate Torres's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The evidence was overwhelming, and the instructions were harmless. Therefore, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the petition for writ of habeas corpus.

Furthermore, we find that the state court decision was not contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. The decision was based on an adequate and independent state-law ground, and the petitioner did not object to the giving of the contested jury instruction at trial.

In conclusion, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the petition for writ of habeas corpus and find that the state court decision was not contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law. Torres's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were not violated by the jury instructions in his state court murder trial.

gold_text: First, we must determine whether “the Supreme Court has prescribed a rule that governs the petitioner’s claim.” O’Brien v. Dubois, 145 F.3d 16, 24 (1st Cir.1998). If so, we analyze whether the state court decision is “contrary to” that prescribed rule. See id. “To obtain relief ... [the] petitioner must show that Supreme Court precedent requires an outcome contrary to that reached by the relevant state court.” Id. at 24-25. Because we agree with the parties that Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985), provides the governing rule, our discussion centers on that Supreme Court case.
