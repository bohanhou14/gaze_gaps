The libel case at hand involves a letter written by appellee to appellant's commanding officer, allegedly damaging his reputation and causing him emotional distress. The letter, which forms the basis of this action, contains several defamatory statements regarding appellant's personal life and financial transactions.

In determining the meaning of the words in the publication, we must consider whether the average reader would understand them in the same way as appellee. By reading the letter as a whole, including its display lines, we can infer that appellee intended to convey that appellant was unwilling to permit his former wife to sell the house and was not keeping the payments current on the first and second trusts.

The Supreme Court has held that "the gravamen of the action is not whether the quotation from 'Southern Progress' is false but whether the characterization of the appellant as a Nazi Trojan Horse is false." Similarly, in the instant case, the question is not whether the statements in the letter are true or false, but whether they are capable of defamatory meaning and whether they damaged appellant's reputation.

As noted in reference case 132 F.2d 734, repetition of a defamatory statement is a publication in itself, regardless of whether the repeater names the source. In this case, appellee's letter repeats the defamatory statements attributed to Mrs. Olinger, and it is for the jury to determine whether these statements were so understood by the recipients of the letter and whether they are, in fact, true.

In conclusion, the libel case at hand presents a genuine issue of material fact, and we remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. The issue of whether the statements in the letter are capable of defamatory meaning and whether they damaged appellant's reputation must be determined by the jury.
