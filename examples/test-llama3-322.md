The concept of a "severe" impairment is crucial in determining disability benefits. In the case of Mark Edwards v. Heckler, 736 F.2d 625 (11th Cir.1984), the court held that an impairment under the second prong of § 12.05(C) need not in itself be disabling. This ruling suggests that the additional impairment must impose significant work-related limitations, not necessarily be disabling in and of itself.

The court in this case, Kaplan v. Commissioner of Social Security, finds that the correct standard for determining whether an "additional" impairment is "significant" within the meaning of § 12.05(c) is whether the "additional" impairment is "severe" within the meaning of 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520(c). The court notes that the actual language of § 12.05(c) does not contain the word "or" between the words "significant" and "work-related", as previously misquoted.

The court also highlights the importance of a specific finding by the Commissioner regarding the severity of the impairments alleged by the plaintiff. In the absence of such a finding, the court cannot determine whether the impairments satisfy the second prong of § 12.05(c).

In conclusion, the concept of a "severe" impairment is a critical factor in determining disability benefits. The court's ruling in this case emphasizes the need for a clear and specific finding by the Commissioner regarding the severity of the impairments alleged by the plaintiff. The court's decision is consistent with the principles established in Mark Edwards v. Heckler, 736 F.2d 625 (11th Cir.1984), and other relevant cases.

gold_text: The Eleventh Circuit, though adopting the severity test at one point, see Edwards v. Heckler, 736 F.2d 625, 629-31 (11th Cir.1984), since has altered its position. Under Edwards ex rel. Edwards v. Heckler, "significant” requires something less than severe, as that term is understood in 20 C.F.R. Section 404.1520(c), yet something more than de minimis. 755 F.2d 1513, 1514-15 (11th Cir.1985). As the impact of the severity test is simply to weed out de minimis claims, it is arguable that it is not possible for a limitation to be more than a de minimis limitation and yet not be "severe” within the meaning of Section 404.1520(c).
