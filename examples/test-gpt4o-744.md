III. 

Lumbermens’ contention that the district court’s summary judgment on other issues disregarded essential evidence is unfounded. As established in case law, evidence must be more than speculative; it must create a material fact issue relevant to the dispute. The district court, aligned with the reasoning in 462 F.3d 762, determined that the evidence presented lacked the substantiation required to demonstrate pretext or a dishonest explanation. This supports the district court’s resolution of remaining issues via summary judgment.

Further, Lumbermens' assertion that earlier disclosure of certain material may have benefited their defense echoes the arguments in 609 F.2d 1294. However, the necessity and impact of such disclosures must be contextualized within Brady material requirements, which mandates that undisclosed evidence be material to the defense. In this case, no indication exists that nondisclosure of the computer-generated summaries materially hampered Lumbermens’ case or that earlier access would have altered the outcome.

Therefore, Lumbermens' claims regarding both the improper admission of evidence and the alleged mishandling of summary judgment on legal issues are without merit. The district court's judgment is affirmed.

IV.

In conclusion, upon careful review of the legal standards and precedents, we find no abuse of discretion or legal error in the district court's rulings. The evidentiary and procedural decisions were consistent with established judicial principles, warranting the affirmation of the district court’s judgment.

Affirmed.

gold_text: Lumbermens next argues that Ma-tush was not qualified to attest to the data entered into the database because he did not input each piece of data that underlies the summaries. However, there is no dispute that Matush, as a Republic Western claims manager, was qualified to testify about the business practices and procedures for inputting the underlying data. It is not necessary for each individual who entered a record of payment into the database to testify as to the accuracy of each piece of data entered. See United States v. Smith, 609 F.2d 1294, 1302 (9th Cir.1979) (“The witness must only be in a position to attest to [the evidence’s] authenticity”) (citation and internal quotations omitted); see also Thanongsinh v. Bd. of Educ., 462 F.3d 762, 777 (7th Cir.2006) (holding that the qualified witness “need only be familiar with the company’s recordkeeping practices”); Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 803.08[4] (stating that witnesses to an electronic data compilation need not personally enter the data).
