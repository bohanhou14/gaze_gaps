The federal definition of embezzlement, as established in case law, includes the fraudulent appropriation of property by a person to whom such property has been entrusted or into whose hands it has lawfully come (Reference case 160 U.S. 268). The courts have described embezzlement as requiring three necessary elements: (1) property rightfully in the possession of a nonowner; (2) the nonowner’s appropriation of the property to a use other than that which the property was entrusted; and (3) circumstances indicating fraud (Reference case 70 B.R. 155). Notably, embezzlement claims must be proven by clear and convincing evidence (Reference case 70 B.R. 155).

In this case, while Transamerica alleged that the debtors engaged in embezzlement by not remitting proceeds as required, the bankruptcy court found that Transamerica did not meet its burden of proof of fraudulent intent by the debtors. Additionally, federal standards override state definitions concerning dischargeability, which emphasize the necessity of clear and convincing evidence of fraud (Reference case 46 B.R. 880).

Given the evidence presented, both the bankruptcy court and the BAP determined that there was no clear and convincing evidence of fraudulent intent necessary to prove embezzlement under § 523(a)(4). Consequently, the debts in question are dischargeable, reaffirming the bankruptcy court's and the BAP's findings.

gold_text: Under federal law, embezzlement in the context of nondischargeability has often been defined as “the fraudulent appropriation of property by a person to whom such property has been entrusted or into whose hands it has lawfully come.” Moore v. United States, 160 U.S. 268, 269 (1885). Embezzlement, thus, requires three elements: “(1) property rightfully in the possession of a nonowner; (2) nonowner’s appropriation of the property to a use other than which [it] was entrusted; and (3) circumstances indicating fraud.” In re Hoffman, 70 B.R. 155, 162 (Bankr.W.D.Ark. 1986); In re Schultz, 46 B.R. 880, 889 (Bankr.D.Nev.1985).
