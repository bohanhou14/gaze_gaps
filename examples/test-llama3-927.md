The legal case at hand revolves around the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C.A. § 3626(b)(2), which permits the termination of prospective relief in certain circumstances. The Inmates argue that this provision violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the separation-of-powers doctrine, and the equal protection principles.

Firstly, the Inmates contend that § 3626(b)(2) deprives them of a property interest - the rights afforded by the consent decree - without due process of law. However, as in McCullough v. Virginia, 172 U.S. 102, 19 S.Ct. 134, 43 L.Ed. 382 (1898), the vested-rights doctrine does not apply here since the consent decree is not a final judgment.

Secondly, the Inmates argue that § 3626(b)(2) violates the separation-of-powers doctrine. However, as in 428 U.S. 1, the provision does not mandate the reopening of a final judgment, but rather limits the substantive relief to which the Inmates are entitled.

Lastly, the Inmates argue that § 3626(b)(2) violates the equal protection principles. However, as in 467 U.S. 717, the provision is an eminently rational means of accomplishing a legitimate congressional purpose - preserving state sovereignty by protecting states from overzealous supervision by the federal courts in the area of prison conditions litigation.

In conclusion, the court finds that § 3626(b)(2) does not violate the Due Process Clause, the separation-of-powers doctrine, or the equal protection principles. The provision is a rational means of accomplishing a legitimate congressional purpose, and the Inmates have no property right in the continued enforcement of the consent decree.

gold_text: The Inmates next raise a due process challenge to § 3626(b)(2) on the basis that it operates retroactively. The Inmates rely on the rule set forth in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. RA. Gray & Co., 467 U.S. 717, 104 S.Ct. 2709, 81 L.Ed.2d 601 (1984), that retroactive application of legislation must pass a due process test not required for legislation having only future effects, namely, “that the retroactive application of the legislation [must be] justified by a rational legislative purpose.” Id. at 730, 104 S.Ct. at 2718 (citing Usery v. Turner Elkhom Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 16-17, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2892-93, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976)). The Inmates assert that, regardless of whether the prospective application of § 3626(b)(2) passes constitutional muster, there is no rational legislative purpose justifying the'retroactive application of § 3626(b)(2).
