The court's decision to grant summary judgment to Mon River Towing, Inc. is correct. As stated in 373 U.S. 206, a vessel's condition of unseaworthiness might arise from any number of circumstances, including defects in the vessel's gear, appurtenances, or crew. However, in this case, the evidence presented does not show that the vessel was unseaworthy at the time of the incident.

The plaintiff argues that the vessel was not properly maintained and that the crew was negligent, but these claims are not supported by the evidence. The court has already granted summary judgment to Mon River on the grounds that it transferred possession, control, and command of the vessel to Chaplin Marine Transport, Inc. under a bareboat charter agreement.

As stated in 400 U.S. 494, a bareboat charter agreement transfers all of the rights and responsibilities of ownership to the charterer. In this case, Chaplin Marine Transport, Inc. was the bareboat charterer and pro hac vice owner of the vessel, and it was responsible for the vessel's seaworthiness at the time of the incident.

The plaintiff has failed to present evidence that the vessel was unseaworthy or that Chaplin Marine Transport, Inc. was negligent. Therefore, the court's decision to grant summary judgment to Mon River Towing, Inc. is correct.

Waterman Steamship Corp., 1963, 373 U.S. 206, 83 S.Ct. 1185, 10 L.Ed.2d 297, 1963 A.M.C. 1649, the Supreme Court concluded that ‘things about a ship, whether the hull, the decks, the machinery, the tools furnished, the stowage, or the cargo containers, must be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are to be used.’ Id. at 213, 83 S.Ct. at 1190, 10 L.Ed.2d at 303. More recently, in Usner v. Luckenbach, 1971, 400 U.S. 494, 91 S.Ct. 514, 27 L.Ed.2d 562, 1971 A.M.C. 277, the Supreme Court said that: ‘A vessel’s condition of unseaworthiness might arise from any number of circumstances. Her gear might be defective, her appurtenances might be in disrepair, her crew unfit. The number of men assigned to perform a shipboard task might be insufficient. The method of loading her cargo, or the manner of its stowage, might be improper. For any of these reasons, or others, a vessel might not be reasonably fit for her intended service.’ Id. at 499, 91 S.Ct. at 517-18, 27 L.Ed.2d at 562.”
