In this case, the district court denied the defendant's request for a one-level decrease under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b)(2) because it found that the government's responses to the defendant's pre-trial motions and the chemical analysis performed by the government constituted trial preparation. However, the court's finding is contrary to the principles established in United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872 (1st Cir.1993), which states that a defendant who "stands poised on the brink of trial has no entitlement to the [b)(2) reduction."

The government's responses to the defendant's pre-trial motions were not related to trial preparation, as noted in United States v. Donovan, 996 F.2d 1343, 1345 (1st Cir.1993), which states that a defendant who "negotiates a guilty plea well in advance of any trial date, such that the government is spared the task of preparing for trial, the purposes of this provision would appear fully satisfied." The chemical analysis and the DEA Agent's affidavit were standard procedures that did not indicate trial preparation.

The court's conclusion that the government had engaged in trial preparation substantial enough to deny the defendant a one-level decrease under § 3E1.1(b)(2) was an abuse of discretion, as noted in United States v. Camp- bell, 27 F.3d 1409, 1411 (1st Cir.1994), which states that a district court commits an abuse of discretion by making an error of law. The defendant's plea was timely, and the government's concession that it did not prepare for trial supports the conclusion that the defendant is entitled to the one-level decrease.

gold_text: A district court may certainly deny a one-level decrease to “a defendant who withholds a guilty plea until he stands poised on the brink of trial.” Morillo, 8 F.3d at 872; see also United States v. Kimple, 27 F.3d 1409, 1413 (9th Cir.1994); United States v. Donovan, 996 F.2d 1343, 1345 (1st Cir.1993). We do not face that situation here. Marroquin gave notice of his intention to plead guilty on April 4. The court set a calendar call for April 13, on which date it apparently planned to set a specific trial date.
