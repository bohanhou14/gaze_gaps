The case of R. A. Holman & Co., Inc. v. SEC presents several procedural issues regarding the revocation of the company's broker-dealer registration and membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. The SEC's order was based on findings that the company's officers made false and misleading statements and willfully violated federal securities laws in connection with the offer and sale of stock in two corporations, Precise Development Corporation and Pearson Corporation.

The company argues that the SEC's order was invalid due to procedural irregularities, including the participation of Commissioner Woodside in the proceedings despite his involvement in the investigation of the company before becoming a Commissioner. However, the court distinguished this case from Amos Treat & Co. v. SEC, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 100, 306 F.2d 260 (1962), where the Commissioner had participated in the investigation and had acquired substantial knowledge of the facts before becoming a Commissioner. The court held that Commissioner Woodside's participation did not disqualify him from participating in the adjudicatory proceedings.

The company also argues that the hearing examiner, William W. Swift, was not qualified to hear the case due to his age. However, the court held that the company's challenge to Swift's qualifications was not timely, as required by § 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the company had failed to challenge Swift's qualifications at an earlier stage of the proceedings.

In addition, the company argues that it was improperly denied access to certain ex parte communications from the SEC staff to the SEC with respect to the consolidation of the proceedings against the company and the amendment to include the Precise stock. However, the court held that the SEC was not required to divulge the communications, which merely concerned the nature of the proposed proceedings.

The case ultimately turned on the sufficiency of the evidence against the company, which the SEC found had made false and misleading statements and had willfully violated federal securities laws in connection with the offer and sale of stock in Precise Development Corporation and Pearson Corporation. The court held that the evidence presented by the SEC was sufficient to support the revocation of the company's broker-dealer registration and membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

gold_text: As to the entries made on petitioner’s books by Klapper, a staff witness who was petitioner’s cashier at the time the entries were made, it is hard to see how they were a “statement” which the SEC was required to divulge under the Jencks case, see NLRB v. Adhesive Products Corp., 258 F.2d 403 (2d Cir. 1958). Nor was it prejudicial error for the SEC to rule with respect to a statement of a witness obtained during investigation that petitioner’s counsel could examine the statement only in the presence of the hearing examiner or of a staff member and could not make copies of it, though he could examine it at length and ask for a recess to examine it. This ruling did not unduly impair counsel’s ability to use prior statements of witnesses for purposes of impeachment — the rationale underlying Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957).
