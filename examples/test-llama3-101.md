The plaintiff appeals the decision to strike the affidavit of EMT Melissa Hodson from consideration. The district court excluded the affidavit because it contradicted Hodson's previous deposition testimony and was thus unreliable. The court found that Hodson's deposition testimony was inconsistent with her affidavit, stating that she did not recall unlatching the lap belt, whereas in her affidavit, she claimed to have a belief that the lap belt was not attached around Clark's waist at any time during the accident.

In Visser v. Packer Eng'g Assocs., 924 F.2d 655, 659 (7th Cir. 1991), the court held that when a witness's testimony contradicts their previous deposition testimony, the court may strike the affidavit as unreliable. Here, Hodson's deposition testimony and affidavit are inconsistent, making her affidavit unreliable.

Furthermore, Hodson's affidavit fails to meet the standard of evidentiary reliability set forth in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). Hodson's affidavit is based on her "memory" and "practice, custom and procedure," which is not sufficient to establish a reliable basis for her opinion.

In conclusion, the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking EMT Hodson's affidavit from consideration. The affidavit was inconsistent with her previous deposition testimony and lacked a reliable basis, making it unreliable and inadmissible. The court's decision is supported by the cases of Visser v. Packer Eng'g Assocs. and Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. Reference cases 75 F.3d 290 and 8 F.3d 1206.

gold_text: The defendants moved to strike the affidavit from consideration during the summary judgment determination, and the trial court agreed and granted the motion to strike. The court found that Hodson’s affidavit was inadmissible because it “clearly contradicted” her prior deposition testimony. The judge relied on Unterreiner v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 8 F.3d 1206, 1210 (7th Cir.1993), which held that “[a] party cannot claim a lack of general knowledge about a subject and later make a statement which requires detailed knowledge about the same subject.” We review a district court’s decision to strike an affidavit for an abuse of discretion. See Buckner v. Sam’s Club, Inc., 75 F.3d 290, 292 (7th Cir.1996).
