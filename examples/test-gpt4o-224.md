**Generation:**

The issue of whether bonds were sold at a discount by including common stock as a bonus must be resolved to determine if the petitioner is entitled to amortize this discount over the life of the bonds. Treasury Regulations 74, specifically Article 68 (3)(a), and the case of Helvering v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 293 U.S. 282, 55 S. Ct. 165, 79 L. Ed. 363, establish that discounts on bonds issued by a corporation can be amortized as expenses. Here, the Board found that the bonds, effectively sold at a discount due to the inclusion of the stock bonus, resulted in a loss that the taxpayer was entitled to amortize.

The contention that the bonds were not sold at par unless accompanied by the stock, resulting in a de facto discount, is well-supported by substantial evidence. While the petitioner argues the stock should be valued at par, the Board’s determination that the stock was worth $40 per share is grounded in evidence illustrating the company's precarious financial situation at the time of issuance. Considering that the company's bonds secured by a lien could not fetch par value, it is unreasonable to assume the unsecured common stock held higher value.

Additionally, applying the legal precedents from Snyder v. Helvering, as referenced in 55 S. Ct. 732 and 79 L. Ed. 1343, supports that a reasonable and useful rule, similar to the “First-in, first-out” rule, must be consistently applied unless substantial evidence suggests otherwise. The Board's decision, based on its extensive fact-finding authority, was neither clearly erroneous nor arbitrary. Thus, its determination of the stock’s value holds firm ground.
