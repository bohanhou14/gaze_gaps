In assessing the adequacy of the Government's response to the Plaintiff's FOIA request, the Court is guided by the precedent established in *Tax Analysts v. DOJ*, 845 F.2d 1060. This case reiterates that an agency need only conduct a search that is "reasonably calculated" to uncover the requested documents, and not necessarily exhaustive (845 F.2d 1060).

The Plaintiff's allegations of an insufficient search rely on speculative assertions, which do not suffice to overcome the presumption of good faith afforded to agency affidavits, as supported by *Albuquerque Publishing Co. v. DOJ*, 726 F.Supp. 851. In addition, under *Ellis v. United States*, the adequacy of a search is not diminished by its failure to produce all potentially relevant material, so long as the search was reasonably thorough (941 F.Supp. 1068).

Regarding the withholding of information under Exemption (b)(7)(C), the Court finds the Government's actions appropriate. The protection of privacy rights for individuals involved in law enforcement activities, as upheld in *Branch v. FBI*, 658 F.Supp. 204, takes precedence in the absence of a compelling public interest (845 F.2d 1060; 726 F.Supp. 851).

In *Tax Analysts v. IRS*, it was held that FOIA does not mandate agencies to provide copies but to facilitate access (492 U.S. 136). The Government's offer to allow Plaintiff's expert to review the original documents at FBI Headquarters aligns with this principle (492 U.S. 136).

Therefore, the Court interprets the Government's search and the proposed method of disclosure as consistent with FOIA requirements and case law precedents.

gold_text: This circuit has taken a similar approach to an agency’s requirements under the FOIA in the case of Tax Analysts v. United States Department of Justice, 845 F.2d 1060 (D.C.Cir.1988), affirmed, 492 U.S. 136, 109 S.Ct. 2841, 106 L.Ed.2d 112 (1989). In Tax Analysts a magazine publisher brought an action against the Tax Division of the DOJ seeking weekly access to certain court opinions, orders and injunctions. The court held that “an agency need not respond to a FOIA request for copies of documents where the agency itself has provided an alternative form of access,” Id. at 1065, for example, by making records available in a “reading room.” Id. at 1067. The court stated further that “[An agency] is not required by statute to mail copies of [records] ... nor even to provide a 'requester-convenient location for access.” Id.
