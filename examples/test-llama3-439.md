The case at hand involves a defendant who has been convicted of various crimes, including drug-related offenses and firearms violations. The defendant has filed a motion to be released pending sentencing, citing his desire to spend time with his family and attend to personal matters before serving his sentence.

The court must consider whether the defendant poses a risk of flight or danger to the community in determining whether to grant his motion. In this case, the court finds that the defendant does not meet the burden of proving that he is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the community.

In United States v. DiSomma, 951 F.2d 494, the court held that a defendant must establish by clear and convincing evidence that he is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the community in order to be released pending sentencing. The defendant in this case has failed to meet this burden, as he has a significant criminal history and faces a lengthy sentence.

In addition, the court must consider whether there are exceptional circumstances that would warrant the defendant's release. In United States v. Lea, 360 F.3d 401, the court held that a defendant must establish that there are exceptional reasons why his detention would not be appropriate in order to be released pending sentencing.

In this case, the defendant has failed to establish that there are exceptional circumstances that would warrant his release. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion to be released pending sentencing.

The court's decision is based on the totality of the circumstances and is guided by the principles set forth in United States v. DiSomma and United States v. Lea. The court finds that the defendant's risk of flight and danger to the community, combined with his lack of exceptional circumstances, weigh heavily against his release pending sentencing. As such, the court denies the defendant's motion and will proceed with sentencing.

His desire to get his affairs in order and speak to his medical professionals simply does not rise to the level of exceptional circumstances. See United States v. Lea, 360 F.3d 401, 403 (2d Cir.2004) (“Exceptional circumstances exist where there is ‘a unique combination of circumstances giving risé to situations that are out of the ordinary.”’) (quoting United States v. DiSomma, 951 F.2d 494, 497 (2d Cir.1991)).
