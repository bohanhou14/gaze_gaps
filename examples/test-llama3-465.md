In the context of legal cases, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and Immigration Judges (IJs) have the discretion to deny or grant motions to reopen deportation proceedings. (Reference case: 485 U.S. 94). In this case, the BIA denied the motion to reopen due to a lack of prima facie evidence supporting the petition to reopen. (Reference case: 20 F.3d 580).

When reviewing a motion to reopen, the court draws reasonable inferences from the facts in favor of the petitioner. (Reference case: 485 U.S. 94). However, if the petitioner fails to present a prima facie case, the court may deny the motion to reopen. (Reference case: 20 F.3d 580).

In the present case, the petitioner, Askari, sought to reopen her deportation proceedings to present new evidence of changes in the equities of her case since the IJ's decision. However, the BIA denied her motion to reopen, finding that the new evidence did not demonstrate a material change in circumstances that would affect her eligibility for asylum. (Reference case: 20 F.3d 580).

In conclusion, the BIA's denial of Askari's motion to reopen was supported by the evidence presented. The BIA's decision was in line with the precedent set by reference cases 485 U.S. 94 and 20 F.3d 580.
