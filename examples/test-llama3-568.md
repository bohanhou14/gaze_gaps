Mayers, a sexual predator, was arrested and interrogated by police detectives. He claimed that he did not voluntarily waive his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, citing that he could not read the search-waiver form and that he made an unambiguous request for counsel, which was ignored. The district court denied his motion to suppress, finding that his statements were voluntary and that he did not make an unequivocal request for counsel.

In evaluating the voluntariness of Mayers' statement, the court applied the totality of the circumstances test, considering factors such as the age, intelligence, and education of the individual, the length and nature of detention, and the use of coercive or punishing conduct by the police. The court found that Mayers was advised orally and in writing of his Miranda rights, was not physically coerced or threatened, and was comfortable throughout the interview.

Regarding Mayers' claim that he made an unambiguous request for counsel, the court held that his statement "I really should have a lawyer, huh?" was ambiguous and was responded to appropriately by the detectives. The court noted that Mayers never requested an attorney at any point during the interview and that his statement was followed by a discussion about the merits of lawyers.

This case is consistent with the Supreme Court's holding in Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 459 (1994), that a suspect must make an unambiguous request for counsel in order to invoke the right to counsel. The court's finding that Mayers' statement was ambiguous is also consistent with the holding in United States v. Montes, 602 F.3d 381, 385 (5th Cir. 2010), that an ambiguous reference to an attorney does not invoke the right to counsel.

In conclusion, the district court's denial of Mayers' motion to suppress was proper, and his claims of Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations were meritless. The court's finding that Mayers' statement was voluntary and that he did not make an unequivocal request for counsel is supported by the totality of the circumstances and is consistent with relevant case law.

gold_text: The consequence of such a “ ‘rigid’ prophylactic rule” is that courts require a suspect to “unambiguously request counsel.” Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 458-59, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994). “[A] statement either is such an assertion [of the right to counsel] or it is not.” Smith v. Illinois, 469 U.S. 91, 97-98, 105 S.Ct. 490, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984) (second alteration in original) (citation omitted). We have held that “a suspect must assert his [right to counsel] with sufficient clarity that a reasonable officer would perceive it as such under the circumstances.” Franklin v. Bradshaw, 545 F.3d 409, 414 (6th Cir. 2008) (citing United States v. Hurst, 228 F.3d 751, 759 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that the Davis standard for invocation applies equally to the right to counsel and the right to remain silent)); see also Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U.S. 370, 381, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010) (holding that “there is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to counsel”). “Simply mentioning the prospect of talking with an attorney, or waiting to talk until one is present, is not sufficient to put the agent on notice that a suspect has invoked his right to remain silent” or his right to an attorney. United States v. Amawi, 695 F.3d 457, 485 (6th Cir. 2012). Thus, where a suspect merely “makes an ambiguous or equivocal reference to an attorney[,] there is no requirement that law enforcement cease questioning.” Ibid, (quoting United States v. Montes, 602 F.3d 381, 385 (5th Cir. 2010)).
