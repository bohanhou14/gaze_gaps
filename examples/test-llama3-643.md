The case at hand involves a 10-year-old's birthday party, which is not directly related to the legal cases provided. However, I can attempt to write a response based on the given cases.

The case of Hale v. United States, 15 S. Ct. 36, 39 L. Ed. 91, presents a situation where the plaintiff seeks to recover damages for personal injuries sustained while working on a vessel. The court ruled that the plaintiff's release of the defendant was not effective due to the circumstances under which the signature was obtained.

In a similar vein, if we were to apply the principles from this case to the 10-year-old's birthday party, we could argue that the party's organizers should take reasonable efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of the children attending. This could include providing a safe and secure environment, ensuring that the activities and games are age-appropriate, and having adequate supervision.

Furthermore, if any injuries or accidents were to occur during the party, the organizers should take swift and appropriate action to address the situation and provide any necessary medical attention. This would demonstrate a commitment to the safety and well-being of the children, much like the court's ruling in Hale v. United States.

In conclusion, while the legal cases provided may not directly relate to a 10-year-old's birthday party, they do offer valuable lessons on the importance of taking reasonable steps to ensure safety and well-being. By applying these principles, party organizers can help create a fun and memorable experience for the children attending. <answer>

citations: ['15 S. Ct. 36', '39 L. Ed. 91']

gold_text: The federal courts hold firmly to the doctrine that no duty rests upon the appellate court to assume the burden of relating requested instructions to those actually given in the charge, in order to determine whether the trial court was in error. For many years the rule of the Supreme Court has been that a party must make every reasonable effort to secure from the trial court correct rulings, or such as are satisfactory to him, before he will be permitted to ask any review by an appellate tribunal. To that end he must be distinct and specific in his objections and exceptions. Fairness to a trial court requires .that the attention of that court shall be specifically called to the precise point to which exceptionâ€™ is taken, in order that it may have an opportunity to reconsider the matter and remove the ground of exception.
