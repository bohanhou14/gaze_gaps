In this case, the court must determine whether the transfer of $10,000 from Debtor to McElroys was a preferential transfer under 11 U.S.C. § 547(b). The court notes that the transfer was made within one year of the bankruptcy filing, and that McElroys were creditors of Debtor at the time of the transfer (785 F.2d 1563).

The court also finds that Debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer, as his liabilities exceeded his assets (112 S.Ct. 527). Furthermore, the court concludes that the transfer enabled McElroys to receive more than they would have received if the case were a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, as they received a lump sum payment whereas other creditors would have received only a pro rata distribution (502 U.S. 151).

The court also addresses the affirmative defense claimed by McElroys, that the transfer was made in the ordinary course of business and financial affairs. However, the court finds that the transfer was not made in the ordinary course of business, as it was a lump sum payment rather than a regular payment made in the ordinary course of business (785 F.2d 1563).

Therefore, the court concludes that the transfer of $10,000 from Debtor to McElroys was a preferential transfer under 11 U.S.C. § 547(b), and that it must be avoided in order to ensure an equal distribution of assets to all creditors.

The primary goal of preference law is to deter “ ‘the race of diligence’ of creditors to dismember the debt- or before bankruptcy furthers the second goal of the preference section — that of equality of distribution.” Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U.S. 151, 112 S.Ct. 527, 533, 116 L.Ed.2d 514 (1991) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 177-78 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6137-78). The scant legislative history behind section 547(c)(2) provides that section’s purpose “is to leave undisturbed normal financial relations, because [such an exception] does not detract from the general policy of the preference section to discourage unusual actions by either the debtor or his creditors during the debtor’s slide into bankruptcy.” Marathon Oil Co. v. Flatau (In re Craig Oil Co.), 785 F.2d 1563, 1565 (11th Cir.1986) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 373-74 (1977), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 6329).
