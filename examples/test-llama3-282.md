In the case of Wayne v. Tew, 290 F. 311, it is established that the court should approve the course of those who refuse to rush to the Patent Office before the merits of their invention have been tested. Similarly, in the case of Joy v. Morgan, 295 F. 931, it is held that a careful survey of the record in the light of these decisions satisfies us that Joy exercised due diligence in his efforts to reduce the invention to practice before he filed.

In the present case, the question of diligence arises as to whether appellee Dunn was diligent during the critical period from the time appellant entered the field - August 26, 1937 - until he reduced the invention to practice in November 1938. The evidence shows that appellee Dunn devoted his attention and work during the critical period to the development of a satisfactory pear peeling means, which is not included in his disclosure or in the counts in issue. Although he had a conception of the invention here involved, it does not appear until that time that he had reduced to practice the invention which comprises the two rotating turrets called for by the counts in issue.

The witness Roy G. Lucks, manager of the Northwest division of the California Packing Corporation and who was associated with appellee, testified that prior to this time, he had repeatedly told appellee that he should concentrate on the development of the peeling turret in order to overcome the difficulties that they were having in peeling the pears. This testimony indicates an intention on the part of appellee to delay the building and testing of the involved invention until he had constructed a satisfactory peeling turret.

It is evident from the board's decision that it was of opinion that work done on any part of the completed machine, although not on the elements defined by the involved counts, constituted diligence by appellee in reducing to practice the invention here involved. We are not of that opinion. It is well settled that diligence will not wait upon commercial expediency. See Bastian v. Champ, 34 App.D.C. 225, 1910 C.D. 321. Therefore, we hold that appellee Dunn did not exercise due diligence in reducing the invention to practice during the critical period.
