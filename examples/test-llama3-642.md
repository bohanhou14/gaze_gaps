ORDER

This appeal marks the third time that Jacqueline Brewer has appeared before us challenging her sentence for aggravated identity theft, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1), and fraudulent use of a social security number, 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B). The district court sentenced Brewer to 65 months’ imprisonment, which we initially vacated and remanded for resentencing in light of United States v. Thompson, 777 F.3d 368 (7th Cir. 2015). On remand, the district court reaffirmed Brewer’s sentence, including an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice.

In determining the sentence, the district court considered Brewer’s actions, including her use of six different names and social security numbers to obtain payday loans, and her fabrication of documents to justify her actions. The court also considered her failure to accept responsibility for her actions and her lack of rehabilitation efforts.

We affirm the judgment. On appeal, Brewer argues that the district court erred in applying an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice, citing United States v. Lewis, 842 F.3d 467 (7th Cir. 2016). However, the court’s application of the enhancement was based on the evidence presented at sentencing, including Brewer’s fabrication of documents and her failure to accept responsibility for her actions.

In Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), the Supreme Court held that a defendant has the right to present new evidence or arguments on remand. However, in this case, the district court did not err in refusing to hear Brewer’s new arguments. The court considered all the evidence and arguments presented at the initial sentencing and reaffirmed the sentence.

We hold that the district court did not err in its application of the upward adjustment for obstruction of justice. The sentence is affirmed.

gold_text: In this second appeal, Brewer challenges only the finding that she obstructed justice by submitting a false document during the sentencing proceedings. The government counters that Brewer waived this claim “by disavowing it on her first appeal.” But as we explained recently in United States v. Mobley, “a Thompson remand gives a district court the power to hear new evidence or arguments (or reconsider the same evidence and arguments) as it fashions the new sentence.” 833 F.3d 797, 802 (7th Cir. 2016). And though after a Thompson remand a district court is not required to consider evidence or arguments that could have been presented during an earlier appeal, the district court “is required to acknowledge that it has this power and explain why or why not it wishes to exercise it.” Id. at 801; see United States v. Lewis, 842 F.3d 467, 473-74 (7th Cir. 2016) (“A remand in light of Thompson vacates the entire sentence, allowing the district court to alter any aspect of that sentence at resentencing.”).
