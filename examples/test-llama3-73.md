After careful analysis of the case, I agree with the rationales presented in Reference case 594 F.2d 1203, which states that it would be "wholly unwarranted and unrealistic" to engage in a presumption that new employees support the union in the same ratio as those they have replaced, especially in situations where there is a strike. In the present case, the Company hired twenty-nine new employees to replace the strikers and anti-union statements were made by permanent replacements, which raises a good faith doubt as to the Union's majority status.

The Board's decision to require the Company to have objectively grounded evidence of the striker replacements' nonsupport of the Union is reasonable and consistent with Reference case 652 F.2d 1055, which established a framework for evaluating a company's withdrawal of recognition of a union. The Company's reliance on the statements made by the cross-over employees and the striker replacements, including Tony Lopez, Bill Lee, Shady Goodson, J.R. Blackshire, Raymond Brunner, Clint Waller, and David Schneider, provides sufficient evidence to support its claim that it had a reasonably grounded good-faith doubt as to the Union's majority status.

Furthermore, the Board's rejection of the presumption that striker replacements favor the union, as stated in Reference case 284 N.L.R.B. No. 113 (1987), or the contrary assumption that striker replacements repudiate the union as their collective-bargaining representative, is consistent with the principles established in Reference case 584 F.2d 720 (5th Cir.1978), which held that the presumption of majority support continues but becomes rebuttable after the expiration of the certification year.

In conclusion, I agree with the Company's argument that it had a reasonably grounded good-faith doubt as to the Union's majority status and that the Board's decision to require the Company to have objectively grounded evidence of the striker replacements' nonsupport of the Union is reasonable and consistent with established case law.

gold_text: We hold that the Company was justified in doubting that the striker replacements supported the Union in this context. Over eighty percent of the bargaining unit work force (twenty-two of twenty-seven employees) was replaced on June 25, 1979. Where such a substantial percentage of the bargaining unit employees is replaced on the same day, and the striker replacements cross a picket line, violent or not, to report to work each day, the Company is justified in counting the striker replacements as employees whom they doubt support the Union. This holding is in accord with the Eighth Circuitâ€™s opinion in National Car Rental System, Inc. v. NLRB, 594 F.2d 1203 (8th Cir.1979). The Eighth Circuit adopted the Gorman presumption where all ten of the original bargaining unit employees commenced a strike and were subsequently replaced by permanent employees who all began work within a one-week period and crossed picket lines to apply for and report to work.
