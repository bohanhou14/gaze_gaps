The case before us involves a dispute over a proof of claim filed by General Motors Corporation (GM) in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Power Five, Inc. (Power Five) objected to the claim, but the Bankruptcy Court summarily overruled the objection without providing any rationale. We must review the Bankruptcy Court's decision to ensure that it is supported by a proper basis.

First, the Bankruptcy Court did not set forth any findings of fact or conclusions of law to support its decision. As stated in In re A-1 Paving and Contracting, Inc., 116 F.3d 242, 243 (7th Cir. 1997), "the Bankruptcy Court's findings of fact are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard." Similarly, in 933 F.2d 1093, the court held that the Bankruptcy Court's conclusions of law should be reviewed de novo. Because the Bankruptcy Court did not provide any basis for its decision, we must vacate and remand the case for further proceedings.

Second, Power Five had standing to object to GM's claim as a creditor. In re FBN Food Services, Inc., 82 F.3d 1387, 1391 (7th Cir. 1996), held that a creditor has standing to object to a claim under 11 U.S.C. § 502. Power Five acquired an interest in the bankruptcy case and had a pecuniary interest in the outcome.

Third, the Bankruptcy Court's decision to overrule Power Five's objection was not supported by principles of waiver, laches, or equitable estoppel. In re Lawler, 106 B.R. 943 (N.D. Tex. 1989), held that the passage of time alone cannot constitute laches. Similarly, in 49 F.3d 286, the court held that a creditor's failure to respond to a trustee's correspondence does not establish a lack of diligence in asserting its right to object.

In conclusion, the Bankruptcy Court's decision to overrule Power Five's objection was unsupported by a proper basis. We must vacate and remand the case for further proceedings. This decision is consistent with the principles set forth in 56 B.R. 990, which held that a creditor has the right to object to a claim under 11 U.S.C. § 502.
