The cases of 397 F.3d 1358 and 493 U.S. 52 provide relevant guidance on the application of retroactive laws. In 397 F.3d 1358, the court held that the January 1993 HQ ruling cannot be applied to conduct occurring prior to the ruling's issuance because it would have impermissible retroactive effect. The court found that the evidentiary presumption and the informal letter demonstrated the unfairness of applying the ruling to pre-existing conduct.

Similarly, in 493 U.S. 52, the court held that the retroactive application of § 502 is justified by a rational legislative purpose. The court found that the retroactive application ensures that all successful claimants are treated alike and that claimants who were fortunate enough to obtain awards prior to the enactment of the statute would not obtain a windfall.

Applying these principles to the present case, it appears that the application of the post-1997 version of section 1151 is justified by a rational legislative purpose. The amendment ensures that all successful claimants are treated alike and that claimants who were fortunate enough to obtain awards prior to the enactment of the statute would not obtain a windfall.

Moreover, the court in 397 F.3d 1358 emphasized the importance of demonstrating the unfairness of applying the ruling to pre-existing conduct. In this case, the Board found that Dr. Bash's credibility is impaired due to statements that he made that are not supported by the evidence of record. This finding undermines the credibility of Dr. Bash's opinion and supports the Board's conclusion that the VA was not negligent in failing to diagnose Mr. Haynes's colon cancer.

In conclusion, the application of the post-1997 version of section 1151 is justified by a rational legislative purpose and does not have impermissible retroactive effect. The Board's decision is supported by the evidence of record and is consistent with the principles of 397 F.3d 1358 and 493 U.S. 52.

gold_text: We see no constitutional difficulty in applying the amended version of section 1151 as Congress has dictated. Even if we were to assume that this application of the amended statute qualifies as “retroactive,” as our precedent has defined that term, see Princess Cruises, Inc. v. United States, 397 F.3d 1358, 1366 (Fed.Cir.2005); see also Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 269, 114 S.Ct. 1483 (“A statute does not operate ‘retrospectively’ merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute’s enactment....”), the burden would lie on Ms. Haynes “to establish that the legislature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way,” and that no “rational legislative purpose” exists for applying the amendment retroactively. See Commonwealth Edison, 271 F.3d at 1341 (quotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U.S. 52, 64-66, 110 S.Ct. 387, 107 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989) (applying rational basis scrutiny). Ms. Haynes has not met this burden. See also Landgraf 511 U.S. at 272, 114 S.Ct. 1483 (noting that “the constitutional impediments to retroactive civil legislation are ... modest” (emphasis omitted)).
