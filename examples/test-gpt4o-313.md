D. Sequential Analysis

Farrah asserts that the District Court erred by bypassing Criminal History Category II and jumping directly to Category III. This contention mirrors her reliance on precedents requiring district courts to "pause at each category to consider whether that category adequately reflects the seriousness of the defendant’s record." United States v. Tropiano, 50 F.3d 157, 162 (2d Cir.1995). However, the Second Circuit allows for some flexibility in this sequential approach. It has been affirmed that "so long as the reasons supporting a departure are fully explained, a mechanistic, step-by-step procedure is not required." United States v. Franklyn, 157 F.3d 90, 100 (2d Cir.1998); see also United States v. Kassar, 47 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir.1995) (departure justified if adequate reasons are provided). 

In Farrah's case, the District Court gave ample reasons for its departure from Category I straight to Category III, citing the severity and extent of her additional criminal conduct, which did not fit neatly into Criminal History Category II. Additionally, precedent from the D.C. Circuit supports the permissibility of such an approach, affirming that full explanation of reasons suffices over a mechanical step-by-step process. See United States v. Bridges, 175 F.3d 1062, 1064 (D.C. Cir. 1999).

Hence, given the robust explanation provided by the District Court, any procedural error in skipping Category II is rendered harmless. Therefore, Farrah's argument concerning sequential analysis is unpersuasive, and the upward departure stands well-supported by existing jurisprudence.

gold_text: Finally, we hold that the District Court did not err in departing from Criminal History Category I to Category III without mentioning Category II. Although a sentencing court should “pause at each category to consider whether that category adequately reflects the seriousness of the defendant’s record,” United States v. Tropiano, 50 F.3d 157, 162 (2d Cir.1995), we have held that such “a mechanistic, step- by-step procedure is not required” where the district court fully explains the reasons for the departure, United States v. Franklyn, 157 F.3d 90, 100 (2d Cir.1998) (quoting United States v. Kassar, 47 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir.1995)); accord United States v. Bridges, 175 F.3d 1062, 1069 (D.C.Cir. 1999).
