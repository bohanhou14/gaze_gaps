Liberal Construction of Pro Se Complaints

The City contends that Mr. Cleaves' complaint should be dismissed because it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. However, it is well-established that complaints filed by pro se litigants must be held to less stringent standards than those drafted by lawyers. As the Supreme Court noted in Haines v. Kerner, “however inartfully pleaded,” a pro se complaint must be liberally construed and should not be dismissed unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief (404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972)).

Similarly, in Hughes v. Rowe, the Court reiterated this principle, emphasizing that the district court’s role is to ensure that pro se litigants' claims are given fair and meaningful consideration (449 U.S. 5, 9-10, 101 S.Ct. 173, 175, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980)). Courts must determine whether the plaintiff should be allowed to present evidence on his claims before deciding on a motion to dismiss (748 F.2d 1142).

Additionally, considering the liberal standards applied to such cases as set forth in Estelle v. Gamble (429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976)), and in light of the notice-pleading standard of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 8(a)), Mr. Cleaves' allegations, though detailed, sufficiently provide the City with notice of the claims and underlying facts.

Therefore, the City’s motion to dismiss Mr. Cleaves' pro se complaint is denied as it fails to demonstrate that there are no conceivable facts under which Mr. Cleaves could prevail.
