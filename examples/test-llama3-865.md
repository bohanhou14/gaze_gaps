**Generation:**


We reject both arguments made by M & M. First, the bankruptcy court did not lack jurisdiction to award sanctions under § 362(k)(l) once it had dismissed the underlying bankruptcy case. As held in Price v. Rockford, 947 F.2d 829, 831 (7th Cir. 1991), a § 362(k)(l) proceeding is a core proceeding that derives directly from the Bankruptcy Code and can be brought only in the context of a bankruptcy case. Therefore, the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction over the § 362(k)(l) proceeding even after the dismissal of the underlying bankruptcy case.

Second, we reject M & M's contention that the bankruptcy court erred in awarding sanctions without holding an evidentiary hearing. The court based its award solely on the attorney's verification, which is permissible under the Bankruptcy Code. See Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 395-98, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990).

In conclusion, we affirm the bankruptcy court's decision to award sanctions to the Johnsons under § 362(k)(l) and reject M & M's arguments that the court lacked jurisdiction and erred in awarding sanctions without an evidentiary hearing. The bankruptcy court's decision was in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and applicable case law.
