**Generation:**

In reaching our conclusion, we draw upon precedent that underscores the connection between whistleblowing against government corruption and the protection afforded by asylum laws. Specifically, in Grava v. INS, 205 F.3d 1177 (9th Cir.2000), the court held that exposing governmental corruption could amount to persecution on account of political opinion, even if the whistleblower did not espouse a political theory. Here, Grigoryan’s actions parallel those of Grava, as both involved exposing corruption in governmental operations. Grigoryan’s exposure led to violent retaliation, echoing the events and rationale of Grava, where whistleblowing against integrated governmental corruption was deemed a political act. 

Furthermore, the Immigration Judge (IJ) erred similarly as in the case referenced in 380 F.3d 1114, where it was determined that retaliation for exposing corruption constitutes persecution on account of political opinion. Therefore, it is evident that the IJ's decision not recognizing Grigoryan's actions as politically motivated persecution is inconsistent with established caselaw. Hence, Grigoryan's claim must be reconsidered under these principles.

Given these precedents, the BIA’s finding that Grigoryan did not demonstrate a nexus between his persecution and a protected ground was a clear error. As such, we grant the petition in part, deny it in part, and remand for further consideration consistent with this memorandum.

Petition GRANTED in part, DENIED in part, and REMANDED.
