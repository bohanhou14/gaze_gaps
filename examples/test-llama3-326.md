In this case, the International Trade Administration (ITA) exceeded the time limits imposed by the statute to issue final results of the antidumping duty administrative review. The ITA failed to provide a written explanation for the delay, and the statute does not impose any adverse consequences for the delay. Philipp Bros., Inc. v. United States, 10 CIT at ---, 630 F.Supp. at 1323-1324 (no restraint or adverse consequences are affirmatively imposed for the delay), appeal dismissed, No. 86-1122 (Fed.Cir. July 18, 1986).

The ITA used the best information available (BIA) for the second review period, which was not supported by substantial evidence on the record. The ITA's decision to use BIA was based on Sharp's failure to provide the supplemental information requested by the ITA. However, the record does not contain any evidence that Sharp was uncooperative or recalcitrant, or that the ITA was unable to obtain the necessary information from Sharp.

The Court finds that a reasonable mind might accept the evidence as adequate to show that the statistical information contained in the record was insufficient to determine whether Sharp's sales to its related distributors were at arm's length. The decision by the ITA to request further information from Sharp is therefore supported by substantial evidence.

The use of BIA in this case was arbitrary and capricious, and the ITA's decision to use it was not supported by substantial evidence on the record. The Court must hold the determination unlawful under 19 U.S.C. § 1516a(b)(1).

In conclusion, the ITA's use of BIA was not justified, and the determination is unlawful. The Court must remand the case to the ITA to reconsider its decision using the correct standard of review.

Supp. 1450, 1455 (1986). Although the eight year delay between the publication of the ITA’s intent to conduct this review and the publication of the final results is deplorable, the appropriate action by plaintiff to avoid delay would have been a suit to enforce the deadlines.
