Furthermore, Matvia's argument that the District Court should have granted an evidentiary hearing lacks merit. As established in United States v. Gonzalez, 970 F.2d 1095, a defendant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing as a matter of right whenever seeking to withdraw a guilty plea. The court may deny such a hearing when the defendant's allegations merely contradict the record, are inherently incredible, or are simply conclusory. This principle was also underscored in the case of United States v. O’Hara, 960 F.2d 11.

In Matvia's case, his claims of being mentally incompetent at the time of his plea amount to conclusory statements without factual support. His assertions contradict the detailed plea colloquy where he provided rational and voluntary responses, which carry a strong presumption of veracity, as referenced in Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, and further supported by Grullon’s statements in 129 F.3d 710.

Given these circumstances, Judge McClure did not abuse his discretion by denying the motion without a hearing. The record sufficiently demonstrated that Matvia's plea was knowing, voluntary, and not coerced, aligning with jurisprudence in United States v. Crooker, 729 F.2d 889. Thus, we affirm the District Court's decision to deny Matvia’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea without holding a new hearing.

gold_text: Indeed, “[a] motion to withdraw a guilty plea may be denied without a hearing where the defendant’s allegations ‘merely contradict the record,’ are ‘inherently incredible,’ or are ‘simply conelusory.’ ” United States v. Torres, 129 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir.1992) (quoting United States v. Gonzalez, 970 F.2d 1095, 1100 (2d Cir.1992)). As found before at the ex parte hearing, the court now finds that defendant’s allegations are simply conelusory statements that contradict the record. Thus, there is no need to hold another hearing on the matter of Sims’s alleged ineffectiveness because it would be needlessly duplicative and wasteful of judicial resources.
