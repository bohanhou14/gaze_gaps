D. Lanham Act Violation

Plaintiff asserts that Defendants violated § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), by infringing on its trade dress. To prevail on a Lanham Act claim for trade dress infringement, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the trade dress is (1) inherently distinctive or has acquired secondary meaning, (2) primarily nonfunctional, and (3) likely to cause confusion among consumers regarding the source of the product. These criteria are outlined in Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 769 (1992) (95 F.3d 663).

In Co-Rect Prods., Inc. v. Marvy! Advertising Photography, Inc., the court identified six factors to determine the likelihood of confusion: (1) the strength of the plaintiff’s mark, (2) the similarity between the plaintiff’s and defendant’s marks, (3) the degree of competition between products, (4) the alleged infringer’s intent to “pass off” its product, (5) evidence of actual confusion, and (6) the degree of care likely to be exercised by purchasers (780 F.2d 1324, 1330 (8th Cir. 1985)).

Applying these standards to the case at hand, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated that its trade dress is inherently distinctive or has acquired secondary meaning. Additionally, Plaintiff has not furnished sufficient evidence of actual consumer confusion or that Defendants intended to deceive consumers.

Given that Plaintiff has not met the required burden of proof, the Court finds that there was no violation of § 43(a) of the Lanham Act by Defendants. This conclusion aligns with the findings in Imagineering, Inc. v. Van Klassens, Inc., where allegations of trade dress infringement and false advertising under the Lanham Act were not substantiated (53 F.3d 1260).

Therefore, Plaintiff’s claim for relief under the Lanham Act is denied.

Poly-Tech Indus., Inc., 95 F.3d 663, 667 (8th Cir.1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1151, 117 S.Ct. 1085, 137 L.Ed.2d 219 (1997). In addressing these issues, this Court defers to the law of the Eighth Circuit, as these trade dress issues are not unique to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit. Imagineering, Inc. v. Van Klassens, Inc., 53 F.3d 1260, 1263 (Fed.Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 909, 116 S.Ct. 277, 133 L.Ed.2d 197 (1995). However, the Federal Circuit will have appellate jurisdiction over these claims brought under the Lanham Act as they are pendant claims under the Patent Act. 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1) (1998); id. The issue presented in a section 1125(a) unfair competition claim is whether Defendants’ actions are likely to cause confusion, to cause a mistake, or to deceive. 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1); SquirtCo v. Seven-Up Co., 628 F.2d 1086, 1090-91 (8th Cir.1980).
