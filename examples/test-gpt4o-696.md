The district court's analysis overlooked the pivotal distinction between contribution limits and expenditure limits as explicated in Citizens United and subsequent cases. In Citizens United, the Supreme Court made clear that independent expenditures do not pose a danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption, implying that the government's interest does not justify limiting contributions to entities like NYPPP that only engage in such expenditures (599 F.3d 686). This distinction has been consistently upheld in federal circuit courts. For example, in Wisconsin Right to Life State Political Action Committee v. Borland, the court ruled that Wisconsin's campaign finance law was unconstitutional in limiting contributions to independent expenditure committees (664 F.3d 139). Similarly, the Ninth Circuit in Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce v. City of Long Beach found that contributions for independent expenditures do not raise corruption concerns (603 F.3d 684).

Consequently, the district court’s error in not addressing NYPPP's likelihood of success on the merits is critical. The plaintiff demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success given the convergence of judicial opinion across circuits. Accordingly, the denial of a preliminary injunction was a reversible mistake, and the balance of hardships and public interest are in favor of NYPPP, acknowledging that protecting First Amendment rights is paramount.

For these reasons, the district court's order is reversed, and a preliminary injunction is to be entered forthwith, preventing the enforcement of N.Y. Elec. Law §§ 14-114(8) and 14-126 against NYPPP and its contributors for independent expenditures, effective immediately.

gold_text: . This result obtains regardless of the standard of review. After Buckley v. Valeo, political contribution limits are subject to heightened scrutiny, which requires that they be "closely drawn” to match a "sufficiently important interest.” 424 U.S. 1, 25, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976). Expenditure limits are subject to even higher scrutiny, requiring that they be narrowly tailored to meet a compelling government interest. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 340, 130 S.Ct. 876. In this case, the effect of the restrictions is to limit contributions that can be made to a committee that seeks to make independent expenditures. It is unnecessary to decide which level of scrutiny should apply, because preventing quid pro quo corruption is the only government interest strong enough to justify restrictions on political speech, see id. at 357-61, 130 S.Ct. 876, and the threat of quid pro quo corruption does not arise when individuals make contributions to groups that engage in independent spending on political speech, see Wis. Right to Life State Political Action Comm. v. Barland, 664 F.3d 139, 154 (7th Cir.2011). See also SpeechNow.org v. FEC, 599 F.3d 686, 694 (D.C.Cir.2010); Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce v.
