The case of Pool v. State of Missouri, 741 F.2d 209 (1984), involves a prisoner's claim of inadequate staffing and protection in the Missouri State Penitentiary. The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the court of appeals affirmed the decision. However, upon reviewing the case, I find that the court of appeals erred in its decision.

In the case of Smith v. Bacon, 699 F.2d 434 (1983), the court held that an action is not frivolous unless it appears "beyond doubt that petitioner can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief." In this case, Pool's complaint alleges that he was assaulted in the prison and that the prison officials failed to provide adequate protection. This claim is not frivolous, as it is based on a plausible set of facts and raises a serious issue of constitutional law.

Furthermore, the court of appeals erred in finding that Pool's claim was barred by res judicata. In Burks v. Walsh, 461 F.Supp. 454 (1978), the court held that the prison officials were not violating the Eighth Amendment by overcrowding and unsanitary conditions. However, the court did not address the issue of inadequate staffing and protection. Therefore, Pool's claim is not barred by res judicata.

In conclusion, I find that the court of appeals erred in dismissing Pool's claim as frivolous. The claim is based on a plausible set of facts and raises a serious issue of constitutional law. The court of appeals should have considered the merits of the claim rather than dismissing it as frivolous.
