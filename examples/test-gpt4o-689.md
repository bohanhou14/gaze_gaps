In this context, the application of the harmless error test has been considered in line with Section 628 and relevant Federal Circuit precedents such as Roth v. United States, 378 F.3d 1371, and Heisig v. United States, 719 F.2d 1153. The Federal Circuit in Roth emphasized the impropriety of courts intruding into military promotion decisions, noting that the judiciary is not equipped to make determinations involving military expertise (Roth, 378 F.3d at 1394). 

Similarly, in Heisig, the court highlighted that the review of Board decisions must respect the limits of judicial intervention, focusing on whether the Board’s decisions were arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, or unsupported by substantial evidence (Heisig, 719 F.2d 1156). This standard underscores the deference due to military determinations, thereby supporting the remand to the Secretary with instructions aligned with constitutional and statutory requirements (Heisig, 719 F.2d 1158).

Given this analysis, the Secretary must conduct a holistic review of Plaintiff’s promotion candidacy, devoid of unconstitutional instructions, ensuring the evaluation respects race and gender-neutral criteria. The materials referenced indicate the necessity of a de novo review using the criteria established post-DOPMA for fairer resolution.

The case is thus remanded for further adjudication by the Secretary following these principles, with a recommendation to document proceedings meticulously for potential judicial review.
