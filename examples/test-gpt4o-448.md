In assessing whether the ICC exercised its discretion appropriately, we must adhere to the principle that judicial review of administrative actions is limited. As stated in Federal Communications Comm’n v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 346 U.S. 86, our role is to ensure that the agency’s actions are guided by proper considerations within the scope of its delegated authority. Moreover, the court must recognize the expertise of administrative agencies and avoid substituting its judgment on specialized matters, per the precedent set in United States v. Pierce Auto Freight Lines, Inc., 327 U.S. 515.

The court must ensure that the agency's decisions are not based on a misinterpretation of statutory policies, as seen in Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, 313 U.S. 177. Here, the ICC's decision, although sketchy, meets the requirement set by Congress that findings must support the order and be justified by substantial evidence, as emphasized in Interstate Commerce Comm’n v. J-T Transport Co., 368 U.S. 81.

Furthermore, the court must evaluate whether statutory standards have been correctly employed, as highlighted in United States v. Carolina Carriers Corp., 315 U.S. 475. The ICC’s findings, though imprecise, provide enough basis to assert adherence to legal principles under the Administrative Procedure Act.

Lastly, considering United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., 294 U.S. 499, the ICC’s decision reflects a reasonable accommodation of transportation conditions, distance, and competition. The precedent in Boston & M. R. R. v. United States, as cited in 371 U.S. 156, reinforces the necessity of expert discretion in such evaluations.

Therefore, this court concludes that the ICC’s order is rationally based and legally sound, warranting enforcement and dismissal of the complaints.
