In reviewing the Secretary's determination, we must consider whether the claimant's impairment prior to age 18 met the statutory definition of disability, specifically the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity due to medically determinable physical or mental impairments expected to result in death or last for a continuous period of at least 12 months (42 U.S.C. § 423(d)). As held in Kerner (358 F.2d 826) and supported in subsequent cases, the burden of proving such a disability lies with the claimant. The ruling in Jones v. Celebrezze (331 F.2d 226) makes it clear that the Secretary is not required to specify job opportunities within this context.

Furthermore, in Marion v. Gardner (359 F.2d 175), the court emphasized the need for concrete clinical evidence. Similarly, the precedent in Adams v. Flemming (276 F.2d 901) clarified that an "implied" disability based on symptoms without concrete, demonstrable diagnostic evidence is insufficient to meet the statutory requirements. Here, the claimant's lack of substantial evidence of disability before age 18, framed against these precedents, provides robust support for the Secretary's decision.

Considering the aforementioned principles and the claimant's reliance on unsubstantiated medical recollections, the Secretary’s decision to deny benefits was backed by substantial evidence. This supports the reversal of the District Court’s judgment as outlined in Easttam v. Celebrezze (364 F.2d 509), thus affirming the Secretary’s initial denial.
