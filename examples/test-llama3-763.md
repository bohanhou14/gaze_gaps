The court will deny the defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the plaintiff’s claim that the unnamed ERT officers used excessive force in violation of his Eighth Amendment rights. According to Hudson v. McMillian (503 U.S. 1, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156, 1992), the court must consider the extent of the injury suffered, the need for the applicable force, the relationship between that need and the force used, the threat to the safety of staff and inmates reasonably perceived by responsible officials, and any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.

In this case, the plaintiff claims that the unnamed ERT officers used excessive force, causing him physical harm and injuries. The court must consider whether the force used was applied “maliciously and sadistically to cause harm” (Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6, 112 S.Ct. 995, 999, 117 L.Ed.2d 156, 1992) or if it was applied in a “good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline” (Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 999, 117 L.Ed.2d 156, 1992).

The court will not dismiss this claim without first reviewing the evidence to determine whether the force used was excessive and if the ERT officers acted with a malicious and sadistic state of mind. The court will also consider the need for the force used, the relationship between that need and the force used, the threat to the safety of staff and inmates reasonably perceived by responsible officials, and any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.

Therefore, the court will deny the defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the plaintiff’s claim that the unnamed ERT officers used excessive force in violation of his Eighth Amendment rights. The court will consider the evidence presented and the relevant case law to determine whether the force used was excessive and if the ERT officers acted with a malicious and sadistic state of mind. <answer>

gold_text: In considering whether an Eighth Amendment violation has occurred, courts examine both objective and subjective components of the above factors. See Duamutef v. Fial, 922 F.Supp. 807, 815 (W.D.N.Y.1996). The objective component of the alleged violation relates to the seriousness of the injury. See Branham v. Meachum 77 F.3d 626, 630 (2d Cir.1996) (citing Hudson, 503 U.S. at 1, 112 S.Ct. at 995-96). The subjective component relates to whether the defendants had a sufficiently culpable state of mind when they were engaging in the alleged misconduct. See Hudson, 503 U.S. at 8, 112 S.Ct. at 999-1000; Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 300, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 2325, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991) (“If pain inflicted is not formally meted out as punishment by the statute or the sentencing judge, some mental element must be attributed to the inflicting officer before it can qualify.”).
