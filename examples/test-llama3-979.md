In the context of the legal cases presented, it is crucial to consider the enforceability of arbitration agreements and their relationship with statutory claims. The cases of Tran v. Tran (54 F.3d 115) and Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight Systems, Inc. (450 U.S. 728) are particularly relevant in this regard.

In Tran, the court held that an employee was not required to seek grievance and arbitration for wage hour claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This decision emphasizes the importance of statutory claims and the need for courts to consider them on their merits.

Barrentine, on the other hand, created an FLSA exception to the general rule that agreements to arbitrate should be enforced as a waiver abridging a plaintiff's right to file a claim in court. The Supreme Court ruled that FLSA rights cannot be abridged by contract or otherwise waived because this would "nullify the purposes" of the statute and thwart the legislative policies it was designed to effectuate.

In the present case, the arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff is enforceable, but the FLSA claim is not subject to arbitration. The court must consider the merits of the FLSA claim and allow the plaintiff to bring it in district court. The worker's compensation claim, on the other hand, must be stayed pending arbitration, as it arises out of an injury to the employee's eye that allegedly occurred on the job.

In conclusion, the enforceability of arbitration agreements is crucial in legal cases. The cases of Tran and Barrentine provide valuable insights into the relationship between arbitration agreements and statutory claims. Courts must carefully consider the merits of statutory claims and ensure that they are not abridged by contract or otherwise waived. In this case, the plaintiff's FLSA claim is not subject to arbitration, and the worker's compensation claim must be stayed pending arbitration. <answer>

citations: ['54 F.3d 115', '78 F.3d 875']

gold_text: The Second Circuit adopts the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Barrentine that a person with an FLSA claim has a statutory right to have his case heard in court. See Tran v. Tran, 54 F.3d 115, 118 (2nd Cir.1995). Drawing from the reasoning in Barrentine, the Court held that the plaintiff was not required to exhaust his arbitration remedy, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, prior to filing his FLSA claims. See Tran, 54 F.3d at 118; See also Austin v. Owens-Brockway Glass Container, 78 F.3d 875, 883 (1996)(where the Fourth Circuit notes the Tran court’s distinction between FLSA and other statutory claims with regard to arbitration agreements and access to the courts). Therefore, under Barrentine and Tran a plaintiff bringing an FLSA claim has a right to have their claim heard in court before he exhausts his arbitration remedy pursuant to a signed agreement.
