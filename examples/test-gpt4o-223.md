To establish a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3), Davis must demonstrate the existence of a conspiracy aimed at depriving him of equal protection or equal privileges and immunities under the law, motivated by a class-based invidious discriminatory animus (76 F.3d 1446; 883 F.2d 650). Specifically, Davis must show: (1) a conspiracy, (2) aimed at impeding equal protection of the law, (3) an act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (4) resultant injury or deprivation of rights (76 F.3d 1446). Furthermore, he must allege with particularity and provide material facts showing that the defendants had an agreement (883 F.2d 650). 

Davis alleges that the defendants conspired to deny his rights owing to racial animus. However, the record lacks specific facts demonstrating that the defendants reached a conspiratorial agreement or acted with discriminatory animus (76 F.3d 1446). The evidence does not substantiate a class-based discriminatory intent or an explicit agreement among the defendants (883 F.2d 650). Consequently, Davis has not met the stringent requirements to establish a civil rights conspiracy under § 1985(3). Therefore, the district court's dismissal of Davis's § 1985(3) claim is affirmed.
