Based on the reference cases, it is clear that the dispute between CPL and Fragchem is governed by the Supply Agreement. The agreement contains an arbitration clause that provides for arbitration in India. However, the reference cases also suggest that the arbitration clause may not be applicable if the agreement has expired.

In Reference case 307 F.3d 601, the court held that the presumption of arbitrability does not fully apply in cases where the arbitration agreement is contained in an expired fixed-term contract. Similarly, in Reference case 486 F.3d 989, the court found that the parties did not form an oral agreement that would have introduced evidence of the contract had it been allowed to do so.

In the present case, the Supply Agreement has an initial term of five years, and it can be terminated upon written notice given at least 180 days before expiration of the initial five-year term. Although the Supply Agreement was terminated in 2002, CPL and Fragchem continued to do business from June 2002 to March 2004. This raises questions about whether the arbitration clause is still applicable.

In Reference case 356 F.3d 731, the court held that the district court did not address the merits of the cross-motion for summary judgment and, on the state of the record, was not satisfied as a matter of law that the party was entitled to prevail in the suit. Similarly, in Reference case 330 F.3d 991, the court found that the district court did not examine the issue of whether the Supply Agreement was still in effect at the time of the April 2004 shipment.

In light of these reference cases, it appears that the arbitration clause in the Supply Agreement may not be applicable in this case. The district court should have examined the issue of whether the Supply Agreement was still in effect at the time of the April 2004 shipment before dismissing the lawsuit sua sponte for improper venue. A sua sponte order of dismissal is improper because it may be waived, and CPL did not file a motion to enforce the arbitration agreement or dismiss on the grounds of improper venue.

Therefore, the district court's order dismissing the lawsuit sua sponte for improper venue should be reversed, and the case should be remanded to the district court for further proceedings. <answer>

gold_text: Because the district court dismissed the case sua sponte for improper venue based on the arbitration clause contained in the Supply Agreement, it did not address the key issue here of whether the parties are still bound by the agreement. On appeal, both parties agree that the Supply Agreement terminated two years before the sale at issue in this lawsuit. However, Fragchem argues that Kirit Parikh’s letter dated June 3, 2002, coupled with Cadila/CPL’s continued manufacture and sale of C Products, indicates that the Supply Agreement was still in full force. CPL, however, relies on this Court’s twin decisions in Nissan North America, Inc. v. Jim M’Lady Oldsmobile, Inc., 307 F.3d 601 (7th Cir.2002), and Nissan North America, Inc. v. Jim M’Lady Oldsmobile, Inc., 486 F.3d 989 (7th Cir.2007), for the proposition that an agreement to arbitrate does not survive if the written agreement between two parties expired, and there was no subsequent written agreement governing the parties’ relationship that contained an arbitration clause. While there are questions of law here, there are also questions of fact, and so the issue of whether the Supply Agreement covered the April 2004 transaction is better left to the district court as a matter of first impression. See International Financial Services Corp. v. Chromas Technologies Canada, Inc., 356 F.3d 731, 740 (“Whether veil-piercing is appropriate depends on a host of considerations that this court is ill-positioned to weigh as a matter of first impression.”); Turner v. J. V.D.B. Assocs., Inc., 330 F.3d 991, 998 (7th Cir.2003) (refusing to direct the entry of summary judgment in favor of one party when the district court had not yet made a ruling on the issue, in part because of the state of the record). What we have ruled here is that it was improper for the district court to dismiss the lawsuit sua sponte on the grounds of improper venue based on an arbitration agreement between the parties when neither party explicitly or effectively indicated that it would not waive arbitration. Nevertheless, even if on remand one of the parties moves to compel arbitration, the district court will still have to grapple with the question of whether the Supply Agreement applies to the transaction at issue.
