**Generation:**


The proposed amended complaint relies on a "Factory Order Addition/Deletion/Change Notice" (factory order) that allegedly modified the original purchase agreement between defendant and the purchaser of the MIRS machines at issue. However, this argument is unavailing. As stated in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.

In this case, the court has already found the language of the license agreement unambiguous and concluded that the January 1990 order of the MIRS machines was outside the scope of the license agreement. 925 F.2d 1580. The proposed amended complaint does not address this finding or provide any new facts that would support a claim for royalties on the MIRS machines. Therefore, the court denies the motion to amend the complaint.

The court also notes that even if the proposed amended complaint were allowed, it would not change the outcome. The court would still have to consider the language of the license agreement and find that it does not provide for the contingency at issue. 774 F.2d 182. As stated in Sunstream Jet Express, Inc. v. International Air Service Co., Ltd., 734 F.2d 1258, 1269 (7th Cir.1984), a contract is not ambiguous merely because it fails to address some contingency; the general presumption is that 'the rights of the parties are limited to the terms expressed' in the contract.

In conclusion, the court denies the motion to amend the complaint as futile and without merit. 754 F.2d 1059. The proposed amended complaint does not provide any new facts or arguments that would change the outcome of the case, and the court has already found the language of the license agreement unambiguous and concluded that the January 1990 order of the MIRS machines was outside the scope of the license agreement.
