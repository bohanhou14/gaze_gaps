In reviewing the case, it is clear that the defendant's bandages were not infringing on the patent of Dr. Spies. The patent does not describe a new or novel invention, but rather an improvement on the existing art. The improvements claimed by Dr. Spies are mere trivialities and do not amount to patentable subject matter.

The case of Tuck v. Patterson (22 L. Ed. 566) is relevant here, as it states that a patent for a better fabric would be unprecedented. Similarly, the improvements claimed by Dr. Spies are not novel or non-obvious, but rather a natural and proper outgrowth of the existing art.

Furthermore, the claims of the patent are invalid because they do not describe a method for producing the claimed results. The patent does not provide instructions on how to achieve the desired characteristics, such as the size of the mesh, the amount of plaster, or the tension of the winding. This is in line with the doctrine set forth in Diamond Rubber Co. v. Consolidated Tire Co. (220 U. S. 428-436, 31 S. Ct. 444, 55 L. Ed. 527), which states that a patent must provide a full and complete disclosure of the invention.

In addition, the prior art taught by the publications referred to, such as the works of Drs. Ware and Albee, show that the features claimed by Dr. Spies were well-known before the date of his alleged invention. The size of the mesh, the amount of plaster, and the tension of the winding were all discussed in these works, and there is no evidence to suggest that Dr. Spies made any significant contributions to the field.

In conclusion, the patent is invalid and the defendant's bandages do not infringe on the patent of Dr. Spies. The improvements claimed by Dr. Spies are mere trivialities and do not amount to patentable subject matter.

gold_text: With such disclosures in the prior art, the conclusion' seemingly is inevitable that Spiesâ€™ efforts were directed to confining the size and weight of certain features of the old bandages within a stated minimum and maximum. Whatever the merits of such an improvement, it pertains merely to degree, and does not reach the legal conception of invention. Smith v. Nichols, 88 U. S. (21 Wall.) 112, 118, 119, 22 L.
