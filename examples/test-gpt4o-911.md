Appellant further contends that the trial court's charge to the jury unconstitutionally diluted the presumption of innocence. To support this assertion, he argues that the instruction allowed the jury to infer guilt without properly considering the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This claim, however, is unpersuasive. The jury instructions must be viewed in their entirety, and isolated statements will not be taken out of context to determine the overall impact on the jurors' understanding. As established in United States v. Demma, 576 F.2d 1250, jury instructions are permissible if they convey the correct legal standards when read as a whole.

This case echoes the reasoning in 543 F.2d 1042, where exclusion of evidence does not inherently implicate a denial of due process. Applying this principle here, the trial court acted within its discretion in determining the sufficiency of evidence relating to the duress defense, and appellant has not shown a clear abuse of discretion that would merit overturning the decision (see also Hamling, 543 F.2d 1042).

Moreover, the absence of material testimony does not ordinarily violate a defendant’s rights. In the case of 476 F.2d 324, the court ruled similarly that excluding a witness did not infringe on the defendant’s right to compulsory process since other avenues for defense were available. By parallel, appellant's inability to present the duress defense did not preclude other relevant defenses or testimony.

Therefore, the trial court's judgment stands, adhering to established legal standards as referenced in 543 F.2d 1042, 476 F.2d 324, and 576 F.2d 1250.

gold_text: We next consider whether the district court’s ruling on the duress defense effectively curtailed defendant’s right to testify in any meaningful way. A defendant’s right to present a full defense, including the right to testify on his own behalf, is not without limits. In responding to the charges against him, an accused must comply with the established rules of procedure and evidence, as must the prosecution, in order to insure a fair trial. See United States v. Corr, 543 F.2d 1042, 1051 (2d Cir. 1976). A criminal defendant’s right to present a full defense and to receive a fair trial does not entitle him to place before the jury evidence normally inadmissible. See id. at 1051-52 (duplicative evidence may be excluded in court’s discretion); United States v. DeStefano, 476 F.2d 324, 330 (7th Cir.1973) (court violates accused person’s constitutional right to present full defense when it denies him right to call an available witness, but no violation occurs unless witness denied to defendant could have produced relevant and material testimony); see also Hughes v. Matthews, 576 F.2d 1250, 1258 (7th Cir.) (“the right of a defendant to present relevant and competent evidence is not absolute and may ‘bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process’ ”), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 801, 99 S.Ct. 43, 58 L.Ed.2d 94 (1978). Once the trial court had determined that the tendered defense failed, evidence going to that defense was irrelevant since it was of no “consequence to the determination of the action.” Fed.R.Evid. 401. Thus, the testimony regarding duress which appellant sought to present was properly excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 402. As the Supreme Court said in Bailey, juries should not be burdened with testimony as to duress where that defense has already been determined to have failed as a matter of law. 444 U.S. at 416-417, 100 S.Ct. at 637-638. The district court’s ruling that evidence legally inadmissible was not to be presented to the jury did not therefore deprive appellant of his constitutional right to testify as to other matters which could properly be received.
