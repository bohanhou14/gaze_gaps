The case at hand involves a civil rights action brought against Chicago police officers Michael J. Schmit and Paul Czernia for allegedly arresting two individuals, Eugene Hartnett and Don Kozlowski, without probable cause. The officers contend that they acted in good faith and with reasonable belief in the validity of the arrest, citing Section 193-l(d) of the Chicago Municipal Code, which prohibits disorderly conduct.

However, the court finds that the officers' actions were unreasonable and violated the plaintiffs' Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. In Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967), the Supreme Court held that a peace officer who arrests someone with probable cause is not liable for a false arrest simply because the innocence of the suspect is later proved. However, the court also noted that the officer's good faith and the existence of probable cause must be considered in evaluating police conduct during an arrest.

In this case, the officers failed to provide any justification for their actions, and the court finds that they could not reasonably have believed in the validity of the arrest. The court is guided by the principle that a police officer cannot prove his reasonable belief in the validity of an arrest by asserting his ignorance of the law, as stated in Foster v. Zeeko, 540 F.2d 1310 (1976). Furthermore, the court notes that the officers knew or should have known the simple, plain, and explicit requirements of the statute under which the arrest was made.

In conclusion, the court grants summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, holding that the officers' belief in the validity of the arrest was not reasonable. The court's decision is consistent with the principles set forth in Pierson v. Ray and other cases that have addressed the issue of qualified immunity in policing actions.
