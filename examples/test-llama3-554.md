Based on the provided references, I will summarize the main points and highlight the key takeaways.

The first reference case, 477 U.S. 317, discusses the concept of summary judgment and its application in federal courts. The court ruled that summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. This decision emphasizes the importance of determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact before granting summary judgment.

In contrast, the second reference case, 477 U.S. 242, addresses the issue of Sunday premium pay for federal employees who are regularly scheduled to work on Sundays but take authorized annual or sick leave. The court held that these employees are entitled to receive Sunday premium pay for regularly scheduled hours that are not worked, but for which they are charged with annual or sick leave.

In the context of this case, the court's decision in 477 U.S. 242 is relevant because it establishes the principle that federal employees are entitled to receive premium pay for regularly scheduled hours that are not worked, as long as they are charged with annual or sick leave. This principle applies to the present case, where the federal police officers were regularly scheduled to work on Sundays but took authorized annual or sick leave.

Based on this principle, the court should grant summary judgment in favor of the federal police officers, as there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding their entitlement to Sunday premium pay. The government's argument that the police officers did not work on Sundays is irrelevant, as the court has already established that premium pay is owed for regularly scheduled hours that are not worked.

In conclusion, the key takeaways from these reference cases are that summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and that federal employees are entitled to receive premium pay for regularly scheduled hours that are not worked, as long as they are charged with annual or sick leave.

gold_text: Appellees’ motion for summary judgment on this ground was accompanied by sworn declarations attesting to the fact that Sundays were part of the appellees’ regularly scheduled workweek. This evidence was unrebutted by the government at the motion for summary judgment. Upon presentation of such evidence, the burden of avoiding entry of summary judgment shifts to the nonmovant to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact precluding entry of such a judgment. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (summary judgment motion may be opposed by the nonmoving party by “any of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves. . . .”); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Since this burden was not met by the government in this case, summary judgment was appropriate. “Regularly scheduled” furthermore need not be interpreted as requiring scheduling on every single Sunday of each month. Rather, all that the language requires is that the scheduling be “regular” as opposed to intermittent. Finally, no challenge is made to the determination by the Claims Court that “the material facts as to liability are undisputed.” Armitage, 23 Cl.Ct. at 484.
