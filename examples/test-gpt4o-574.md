In this case, parallels may be drawn to the issues discussed in reference cases 321 F.2d 409 and 285 F.2d 162. In reference case 321 F.2d 409, the court meticulously examined the sufficiency of evidence and the assignation of fraudulent knowledge to individuals based on their roles within a company. Similarly, in our case, the defendants' involvement and the extent of their knowledge or evasion of service requires close scrutiny. Specifically, the role of Marsh and the Countrymans must be assessed in light of actual actions versus alleged procedural defiance.

Turning attention to 285 F.2d 162, where the SEC instituted a comprehensive suit against multiple corporate entities and individuals, the necessity for a fair trial on merits despite procedural complications was emphasized. The relevance here lies in the appellants' assertion of improper class-action claims and procedural delays which were challenged and remanded for complete trials. Our case similarly hinges on procedural diligence versus substantial justice, necessitating a balance between expeditious legal processes and fair adjudication on merits.

In conclusion, the dismissal actions towards the appellee Marsh reflect reasoned judicial discretion in light of procedural evasion and prejudice. Contrarily, as in reference 285 F.2d 162, the dismissal involving the Countrymans and Dennison, due to implications of service evasion and lack of prejudice, may necessitate reassessment. The Court's emphasis on actual prejudice and procedural fairness provides a legal framework for adjudicating such complex procedural dilemmas.
