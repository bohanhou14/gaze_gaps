In the case of Rosemary GambarDELLA v. City of Camden, the court held that the City of Camden, as a political subdivision of the State of New Jersey, enjoys no sovereign immunity from suit in this Court. The court found that the City of Camden, as a municipality, is not entitled to invoke any Eleventh Amendment immunity from jurisdiction in a federal court, citing Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391 (1979) and Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977).

The court also noted that the City of Camden's argument that it was performing a governmental function on behalf of the State of New Jersey and was therefore an "arm, agency, or alter ego" of the state was without merit, citing S. J. Groves & Sons Co. v. New Jersey Turnpike Authority, 268 F.Supp. 568 (1967) and Ananko v. Harsanyi, 91 B.R. 231 (1988).

In addition, the court found that the entry of the In Rem Final Judgment on December 27, 1989, was a fraudulent transfer and therefore subject to avoidance under 11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(2), citing Hoffman v. Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance, 492 U.S. 96 (1989) and Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48 (1979).

For these reasons, the court entered judgment in favor of the Debtor and against the City of Camden, declaring that the transfer of the debtor's interest in the property located at 600 Mechanic Street, Camden, New Jersey by entry of the December 27, 1989 In Rem Final Judgment was avoided as a fraudulent transfer, and ordering the City of Camden to deliver possession of the subject premises to the debtor in possession and to transfer title to the subject property to the debtor in possession.

The court's decision in this case is consistent with the holdings of the Supreme Court in Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391 (1979) and Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), which have consistently refused to find that sovereign immunity applies to political subdivisions of the states, such as municipalities

gold_text: [L]ocaI law and decisions defining the status and nature of the agency involved in its relation to the sovereign are factors to be considered, but only one of a number that are of significance. Among the other factors, no one of which is conclusive, perhaps the most important is whether, in the event plaintiff prevails, the payment of the judgment will have to be made out of the state treasury; significant here also is whether the agency has the funds or the power to satisfy the judgment. Other relevant factors are whether the agency is performing a governmental or proprietary function; whether it has been separately incorporated; the degree of autonomy over its operations; whether it has the power to sue and be sued and to enter into contracts; whether its property is immune from state taxation, and whether the sovereign has immunized itself from responsibility for the agency’s operations.
