Based on the provided references, it is clear that the petitioner, Saenz-Jurado, is seeking a certificate of appealability (COA) to challenge the district court's denial of his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 application for a writ of habeas corpus. However, the district court denied his application as time-barred under § 2244(d)(1), and Saenz-Jurado is now seeking a COA from this court.

In order to obtain a COA, Saenz-Jurado must make a "substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right" (§ 2253(c)(2)). The district court denied his habeas application on procedural grounds without reaching the underlying constitutional claims, and therefore, Saenz-Jurado must show that "jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling" (Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)).

Saenz-Jurado claims that his federal habeas application was timely filed, citing equitable tolling under AEDPA. However, the court finds that the limitations period is not equitably tolled, citing Davis v. Johnson, 232 F.3d 799, 811 (5th Cir.1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1074, 119 S.Ct. 1474, 143 L.Ed.2d 558 (1999). The court concludes that Saenz-Jurado did not exercise due diligence in pursuing his federal claims and did not demonstrate why he did not pursue his appeal out of time after receiving permission from the state district court.

Furthermore, the court finds that Saenz-Jurado's claims of lack of access to legal materials, mental illness, and conflict of interest do not constitute extraordinary circumstances that would warrant equitable tolling. The court cites Miller v. Marr, 141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998), and Yang v. Archuleta, 525 F.3d 925, 929-30 n. 7 (10th Cir.2008), for the proposition that a

gold_text: Fifth, equitable tolling is also appropriate when a defendant is actually innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted. Gibson v. Klinger; 232 F.3d 799, 808 (10th Cir.2000). Saenz-Jurado argues that he is innocent because the cocaine he was convicted of distributing belonged to someone else. But given his concession that the cocaine was found inside the vehicle he was driving (even though it was also occupied by another individual), he has made no showing that, “in light of all the evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him” of the offense. Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (quotation omitted). Further, Saenz-Jurado’s claim that the state court did not establish a factual basis for his conviction faces the same deficiency; he does not make the required showing of actual innocence.
