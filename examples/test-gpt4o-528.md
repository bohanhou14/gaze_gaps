Count I, which alleges retaliation in violation of the FCA, 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h), is dismissed against individual defendants Stanley and Henderson. This conclusion aligns with the precedent set in United States ex rel. Siewick v. Jamieson Sci. & Eng’g, 322 F.3d 738, which established that individual supervisors are not liable under the FCA.

Similarly, Count II, alleging reprisal in violation of the DCWPA, 10 U.S.C. § 2409, is dismissed against Stanley and Henderson. The analysis here parallels the reasoning used in the FCA context (refer to United States ex rel. Siewick, 322 F.3d 738). Only CKC can be held liable under this statute as it defines a contractor as “a person awarded a contract with an agency.” This definition excludes individual supervisors from liability.

On Count III, Brach does not provide sufficient detail regarding the existence of an employee benefit plan under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a). This deficiency is consistent with the ruling in Yesudian ex rel. United States v. Howard Univ., 270 F.3d 969, 972 (D.C. Cir. 2001), highlighting that statutory provisions do not extend to individuals unless explicitly stated.

Thus, each claim against the individual defendants is dismissed per these precedents, affirming the interpretations in referenced cases.
