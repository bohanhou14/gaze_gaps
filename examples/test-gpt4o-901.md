The finality requirement in bankruptcy appeals presents a nuanced issue. According to case law, a court of appeals has jurisdiction only over final judgments in bankruptcy proceedings, reflecting the more flexible finality doctrine specific to bankruptcy contexts. For instance, in Commodore Holdings, Inc. v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 331 F.3d 1257 (11th Cir.2003), it was noted that finality involves the resolution of discrete controversies within the broader bankruptcy administration (Reference case 532 F.3d 1134). 

Moreover, the applicability of finality under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d) and § 1291 in bankruptcy requires that the order must conclude the litigation on the merits, leaving only the execution of the judgment— a principle supported by Jove Eng’g v. IRS, 92 F.3d 1539 (11th Cir.1996) (Reference case 532 F.3d 1134).

In this case, Colbourne's inability to cram down Ocwen’s claims without receiving a Chapter 13 discharge aligns with the reasoning in In re Lilly and In re Jarvis. These precedents underscore that lien modifications imposed via a plan are not permanent without discharge (Reference case 866 F.2d 1372). The court’s analysis affirms that temporary modifications do not alter a creditor's rights unless the debtor achieves a discharge.

Ultimately, the district court's affirmation of the bankruptcy court’s decision aligns with the broader judicial perspective that final, appealable orders in bankruptcy must conclusively resolve discrete disputes without open issues remaining for bankruptcy court action (Reference case 532 F.3d 1134, 866 F.2d 1372). Therefore, Colbourne’s appeal fails, and the bankruptcy court's decision stands.

gold_text: . The district court's order affirming the bankruptcy court's denial of Colbourne's motions is a final and appealable order. See In re Donovan, 532 F.3d 1134, 1136 (11th Cir.2008); T & B Scottdale Contractors v. United States, 866 F.2d 1372, 1375 (11th Cir.1989).
