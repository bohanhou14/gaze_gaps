The present case involves a dispute over the application of § 26(c) of the Revenue Act of 1936, which allows a corporation to claim a credit for amounts required to be paid or set aside within the taxable year to discharge a debt. The Antietam Hotel Corporation (petitioner) claimed a credit for payments made to the Baltimore Trust Company, the successor trustee, pursuant to a supplemental indenture entered into in 1934.

The Court of Appeals held that the payments were not entitled to the credit because the indenture did not require the payments to be made within the taxable year. The Court relied on the Supreme Court's decision in Helvering v. Moloney Electrical Co., 120 F.2d 617, which held that the payments must be made within the taxable year to qualify for the credit.

The Court also noted that the Treasury Regulation 94, Art. 26(c)(2) provides that the credit is limited to amounts actually set aside within the taxable year. The Court found that the indenture did not meet this requirement because it only required payments to be made on March 20th of each year, rather than during the taxable year.

The Court's decision is consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions in cases such as 240 U.S. 103, 305 U.S. 281, and 308 U.S. 488, which have held that the tax laws require strict compliance with the requirements for claiming credits and deductions.

The Court's decision is also consistent with the decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals in cases such as 43 B.T.A. 426 and 43 B.T.A. 1127, which have held that the payments must be made within the taxable year to qualify for the credit.

In conclusion, the Court's decision in this case is consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions and the decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals, and holds that the payments made by the Antietam Hotel Corporation were not entitled to the credit under § 26(c) of the Revenue Act of 1936 because they were not made within the taxable year.

gold_text: It is familiar law that there are no inherent or constitutional rights to deductions under a taxing law; such deductions are purely a matter of governmental grace. Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., 240 U.S. 103, 36 S.Ct. 278, 60 L.Ed. 546. Consequently, it has been said many times that provisions in a Federal Taxing Statute granting special exemptions are to be strictly construed, and that the taxpayer must carry the burden of showing a compliance with the precise terms of the exemption. White v. United States, 305 U.S. 281, 292, 59 S.Ct. 179, 83 L.Ed. 172; Deputy v. DuPont, 308 U.S. 488, 493, 60 S.Ct. 363, 84 L.Ed. 416; Helvering v. Northwest Steel Rolling Mills, 311 U.S. 46, 49, 61 S.Ct. 109, 85 L.Ed. 29. In this connection, it may be stated that the cases in petitioner’s brief wherein “permanently set aside” was construed for charitable purposes are not directly in point. It is well settled that charities are spoiled children of the law. In re Tiffany’s Estate, Surr.Ct.1935, 157 Misc. 873, 285 N.Y.S. 971; cf. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Helvering, Com’r of Internal Revenue, 301 U.S. 379, 57 S.Ct. 813, 81 L.Ed. 1169. We are not impressed by petitioner’s contention that the statutory conditions precedent to the granting of the credits in question are harsh. Cf. Lafayette Hotel Co. v. Commissioner, 43 B.T.A. 426 (strict construction of § 26(c) (2); Nevada-Massachusetts Co. v. Commissioner, 43 B.T.A. 1127 (same). Such arguments are for Congress and not for the Courts.
