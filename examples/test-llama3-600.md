The case of Wallis v. Justice Oaks II, Ltd. (In re Justice Oaks II, Ltd.), 898 F.2d 1544, is relevant in this matter. The court held that a bankruptcy court's order confirming a plan of reorganization is given the same effect as any district court's final judgment on the merits. This means that a creditor who has accepted a plan of reorganization and failed to object to its confirmation is precluded from later challenging the plan's terms.

In this case, GMAC accepted the confirmation order without objection and has received payments under the plan. GMAC's amended claim for interest under section 1325(a)(5) is an impermissible collateral attack on the order confirming the plan. The court finds that GMAC waived its right to claim interest by failing to object to the confirmation order and by accepting payments under the plan.

The decision in Fawcett v. United States (In re Fawcett), 758 F.2d 588, is also relevant. The court held that a debtor's plan that proposes to pay secured creditors in full - 100% - may be interpreted as guaranteeing the payment of post-petition interest to those creditors entitled to it under section 506(b). However, in this case, the debtor's plan did not propose to pay post-petition interest and GMAC was aware of this when it accepted the plan.

Based on the above, the court finds that GMAC's amended claim for interest under section 1325(a)(5) is an impermissible collateral attack on the order confirming the plan and is therefore disallowed. The court sustains the debtor's objection to the claim.
