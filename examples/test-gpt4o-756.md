Our determination finds support in the referenced cases. For instance, in Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U.S. 431, the Supreme Court upheld Georgia’s election statutes requiring minor-party candidates to demonstrate a modicum of support through petition signatures amounting to 5% of voters — a decision underscoring an important state interest in avoiding confusion and ensuring democratic process integrity. Similarly, in Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, the Court acknowledged that States may condition ballot access to ensure candidates possess sufficient support.

Further, in American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U.S. 767, a requirement for minor-party candidates to demonstrate support by a modest percentage was upheld, balancing the state's objectives to maintain electoral order and minimize voter confusion against the burden imposed. Consistent with these principles, and given that North Carolina’s requirement affords ample time to gather signatures and occurs post-primary, it does not impose undue burden on Plaintiffs.

Therefore, the May 17 deadline coupled with the overall statutory framework demonstrates regulatory interests that justify any imposed burdens, reaffirming the district court's judgment. Hence, we conclude that the minor burdens imposed by North Carolina’s election laws are justified by the state’s interests and do not violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments.

gold_text: To support its choice of a May 17 deadline, North Carolina relies on its general interest in regulating the election process. There is “an important state interest in requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization’s candidate on the ballot&emdash;the interest, if no other, in avoiding confusion, deception, and even frustration of the democratic process at the general election.” Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U.S. 431, 442, 91 S.Ct. 1970, 29 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). States are not required “to make a particularized showing of the existence of voter confusion, ballot overcrowding, or the presence of frivolous candidacies prior to the imposition of reasonable restrictions on ballot access.” Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, 194-95, 107 S.Ct. 533, 93 L.Ed.2d 499 (1986). 'Indeed, states have an interest “in ensuring -orderly, fair, and efficient procedures for the election of public officials.” See S. C. Green Party, 612 F.3d at 759. This interest necessarily requires the imposition of some cutoff period “to verify the validity of signatures on the petitions, to print the ballots, and, if necessary, to litigate any challenges.” See Am. Party of Tex. v. White, 415 U.S. 767, 787, n. 18, 94 S.Ct. 1296, 39 L.Ed.2d 744 (1974).
