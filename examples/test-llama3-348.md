The provided cases, 572 F.3d 878, 821 F.3d 1293, and 470 U.S. 564, are significant in understanding the legal framework and standards of review. In the context of the present case, we must consider the district court's findings and application of the sentencing guidelines.

Regarding the district court's finding of aggravated assault, we review it for clear error. The court relied on Boone's testimony, which described Smith's threats to her life while holding a firearm. This testimony, supported by a preponderance of the evidence, is sufficient to meet the standard required to impose the enhancement. United States v. Sepulveda, 115 F.3d 882, 890 (11th Cir.1997).

Smith's argument that Boone's testimony is unreliable is unpersuasive. The district court properly considered Boone's grand jury testimony, which corroborated her statements to the police. United States v. Robertson, 493 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2007). Moreover, the court's finding of an aggravated assault is supported by the evidence, including the presence of firearms and Smith's actions.

In reviewing the district court's application of the sentencing guidelines, we defer to its discretion. United States v. Remillong, 55 F.3d 572, 574 (11th Cir.1995). The court's determination that Smith's offense level was 23 is supported by the evidence and consistent with the guidelines.

In conclusion, the district court's findings and application of the sentencing guidelines are supported by the evidence and consistent with the standards of review. We affirm the sentence imposed on Smith, 92 months in prison and three years of supervised release. <answer>

gold_text: We review a sentencing court’s findings of fact for clear error. United States v. Gupta, 572 F.3d 878, 887 (11th Cir. 2009). A finding is clearly erroneous if, after reviewing all the evidence, we are “left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” Id. (quotation omitted). A factfinder’s choice between “two permissible views of the evidence ... cannot be clearly erroneous.” United States v. Smith, 821 F.3d 1293, 1302 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). A “permissible view” is an “account of the evidence [that] is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.” Anderson, 470 U.S. at 574, 105 S.Ct. at 1511.
