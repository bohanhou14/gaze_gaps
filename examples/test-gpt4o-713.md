**Generation:**

The Board’s task was to determine whether the ’018 patent’s written description disclosed random massively parallel sequencing (MPS), as required by the later-added claims, and not merely to assess whether the description did not preclude targeted MPS sequencing. Analogous to 277 F.3d 1338, where the Board’s decision was vacated for failing to meet adjudicative standards, the Board here improperly applied an erroneous premise and failed to explain key terms or account for substantial evidence in the specification. Similar to the intervention in the case referenced at 842 F.3d 1376, where improper reliance on certain evidence required vacating a decision, the Board’s reliance on Dr. Gabriel’s testimony, without substantial evidence connecting target and random sequencing on the Illumina platform, mandates a reassessment. This failure to properly evaluate evidence and specification consistency also reflects an error akin to the complexities and need for reassessment seen in 805 F.3d 1359, demonstrating the necessity for a thorough reevaluation by the Board. Therefore, like in the cited cases, a careful reassessment and possibly an elucidation of these terms and evidence are crucial to ensure a complete and accurate determination on written description compliance.
