The case presented involves a request for reversal of a decree denying interest and attorney's fees to plaintiffs. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs are estopped from seeking further relief because they have received the principal sum of the taxes adjudged against them. However, the court holds that the receipt of the taxes does not prevent the further prosecution of an appeal taken to reverse a decree denying interest and attorney's fees claimed thereon.

In United States v. Dashiel, 3 Wall. 688, 702, 18 L. Ed. 268, the Supreme Court stated that partial satisfaction of a judgment, whether obtained by a levy or voluntary payment, is not a bar to a writ of error, where it appears that the levy was made or the payment was received prior to the service of the writ. The court also cited United States v. Embry, which held that no waiver or release of errors, operating as a bar to the further prosecution of an appeal or writ of error, can be implied, except from conduct which is inconsistent with the claim of a right to reverse the judgment or decree.

In reference to the case at hand, the court notes that the plaintiffs withdrew the sum of $2,812.50 from the registry of the court, and this withdrawal is the basis of the motion to dismiss. The court holds that the withdrawal does not impair the right of the plaintiff to prosecute the writ, and that the rule as stated in the standard writer has prevailed in the parent country from a very early period in the history of her jurisprudence to the present time.

In conclusion, the court's decision is in line with the precedent set in United States v. Dashiel and United States v. Embry, and the plaintiffs are not estopped from seeking further relief. The withdrawal of the sum from the registry of the court does not prevent the further prosecution of the appeal, and the court's decision is based on the principles of law and equity.

gold_text: We do not find it necessary to enter into a discussion of these questions in view of the acceptance by the appellant of the amount allowed him in full satisfaction and discharge of the judgment. He contends that there is no inconsistency in his acceptance of the money and the prosecution of the appeal, relying on such decisions as Embry v. Palmer, 107 U. S. 3, 8, 2 S. Ct. 25, 27 L. Ed. 346; McFarland v. Hurley (C. C. A.) 286 F. 365; Carson Lumber Co. v. St. Louis, etc., Railroad Co. (C. C. A.) 209 F. 191, 193.; Snow v. Hazlewood (C. C. A.) 179 F. 182. But it is obvious that he falls within the general rule and not within the exceptions thereto as set out in Carson Lumber Co. v. St. Louis, etc., Railroad Co., supra, as follows:
