In the context of class actions, the cy pres doctrine is a common remedy utilized to distribute unclaimed funds to a "next best" class when the plaintiffs cannot be compensated individually. This doctrine, also referred to as "fluid recovery," offers four approaches to the distribution of unclaimed settlement or damage funds, including reduction of the defendant's prices, escheat to a governmental body, establishment of a "consumer trust fund," and "claimant fund sharing." (Reference case 84 F.3d 451)

In the present case, the Court concludes that the best equitable claim to the Remaining Settlement Fund belongs to the non-claiming class members, who are bound by the final judgment in these matters and furnished equal consideration for the settlement. (Reference case 307 F.3d 679) Therefore, the Court shall consider Class Plaintiffs proposal for the Remaining Settlement Fund, which recommends a cy pres distribution to the Endowment Fund at The George Washington University Law School. This fund would support an endowed academic chair or chairs, conduct research on international and transnational antitrust litigation, and host conferences on this topic.

The Court accepts Defendants' assertion that they cooperated fully in achieving compensation for the claiming class members. However, reversion of a portion of the Remaining Settlement Fund to Defendants is not justified, as this would contradict the punitive and deterrence goals of the Sherman Act. The Court shall therefore deny Defendants' Cross-Motion for Partial Refund and grant Class Plaintiffs Motion to Distribute insofar as it relates to distributions to the Supplemental Claimants and the Claims Administrator.

gold_text: Although it has not explicitly endorsed the practice, the D.C. Circuit has recognized that “[i]n class actions, some courts have applied the equitable doctrine of cy pres to undistributed damage or settlement funds.” Dem. Cent. Comm. of the Dist. of Columbia v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Comm’n, 84 F.3d 451, 455 (D.C.Cir.1996). The cy pres doctrine allows unclaimed settlement funds to be distributed to the “next best” use, that is, for the indirect benefit of the class and the non-claiming class members, when plaintiffs cannot be compensated individually. Id.; see also Newberg § 11. 20. Class Plaintiff correctly notes that courts have utilized the cy pres doctrine in distributing unclaimed settlement funds from antitrust actions. See e.g., Motorsports Merch., 160 F.Supp.2d at 1395; Schwartz v. Dallas Cowboys Football Club, Ltd., 362 F.Supp.2d 574, 577 (E.D.Pa.2005); In re Airline Ticket Comm’n Antitrust Litig., 307 F.3d 679, 682-84 (8th Cir.2002).
