After reviewing the legal cases, it is clear that the denial of the motion to compel discovery is justified. In the case of 196 F.3d 1292, the court held that the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion to compel discovery. Similarly, in the case of 221 F.3d 1160, the court concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting discovery in a Title VII case.

In the case at hand, the district court's denial of the motion to compel discovery is also justified. The court provided a valid reason for not awarding costs to the prevailing party, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d). The court also did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants, as the plaintiff failed to present evidence that would establish the existence of an element essential to his case.

The court's decision is also supported by the precedent set in Pippinger v. Rubin, 129 F.3d 519, 533 (10th Cir.1997), which holds that discovery rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. In this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to compel discovery.

In conclusion, the denial of the motion to compel discovery is justified based on the legal precedents and the evidence presented in the case. The district court's decision is consistent with the applicable law and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.

gold_text: Plaintiff also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to compel defendants to produce all building permits that had been denied during the previous four years. We review discovery rulings, including the denial of a motion to compel discovery, for an abuse of discretion. Soma Med. Int’l v. Standard Chartered Bank, 196 F.3d 1292, 1300 (10th Cir.1999). In this case, the only building permit denials relevant to plaintiffs claims are those relating to property that had been the subject of three years’ of abatement proceedings before the permit was requested. As plaintiff made no attempt to narrow his discovery request, we conclude the district court did not err in denying his motion to compel. The district court was not required to permit plaintiff to engage in a “fishing expedition” in the hope of supporting his claim. See Munoz v. St. Mary-Corwin Hosp., 221 F.3d 1160, 1169 (10th Cir.2000).
