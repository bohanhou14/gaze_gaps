In the context of bankruptcy cases, the determination of attorney fees is a crucial aspect of the bankruptcy process. The court's discretion in this matter is well-established, as seen in cases such as In re Nine Assocs., 76 B.R. 943, 944 (S.D.N.Y.1987). The court's decision to award or deny attorney fees is rarely set aside, and reversal is justified only when there is no evidence whatsoever to sustain the findings.

In this particular case, the bankruptcy court's decision to disallow some of the requested compensation is supported by the court's careful examination of each time entry to ascertain whether the services were adequately documented and whether they were actual and necessary. This is in line with the principles outlined in 19 F.3d 833, where the court emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with the particularization requirements of § 330(a).

Furthermore, the bankruptcy court's decision to disallow the majority of hours claimed by the law students is also justified. As seen in 711 F.2d 1136, the court may disallow fees for any of the law students' time if the information provided does not allow for a reliable determination of compensability or if the court would benefit from legal argument.

In conclusion, the bankruptcy court's decision to disallow some of the requested compensation is supported by the court's careful examination of each time entry and is in line with established principles in bankruptcy law. The court's discretion in this matter is well-established, and reversal is justified only when there is no evidence whatsoever to sustain the findings.

A decision in the Third Circuit suggests that the Bankruptcy Code, and possibly the dictates of Fifth Amendment due process, would mandate a hearing so that a good faith applicant could defend its fee application. See In re Busy Beaver Bldg. Centers, Inc., 19 F.3d 833, 846 (3d Cir.1994). This court declines to extend that suggestion and will abide by the general rule that uncertainties due to poor record-keeping will be resolved against the applicant.
