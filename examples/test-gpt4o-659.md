The principles regarding judicial review of agency action as it pertains to this case can draw significant insights from several Supreme Court rulings. As established in Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, judicial review of a final agency action is a foundational aspect of administrative law unless explicitly precluded by statute. The reviewing court must sustain this presumption of judicial review, and thus this case falls within the general doctrine that interpretations and applications of statutes by the Commissioner are subject to judicial scrutiny.

Moreover, the Administrative Procedure Act embodies this presumption, stating that final agency actions without other adequate court remedies are subject to review (387 U.S. 136). Here, plaintiffs allege that the federal defendants' interpretation and application of the by-pass provisions under 20 U.S.C. § 2740(b) are arbitrary and capricious, necessitating the review standards outlined in 5 U.S.C. § 706.

Further, the comprehensive legislative scheme context of agency action review is highlighted in case 432 U.S. 491. This reinforces the necessity to assess the Attorney General's actions under the entire legislative framework, which equally applies to the Secretary's duties under Title I.

The scope of judicial review extends to ensuring that agency actions are not arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in compliance with the law as per 401 U.S. 402. Therefore, interpreting the non-reviewability of the Secretary’s invocation of the by-pass provisions under 20 U.S.C. § 2740(b) cannot be inferred without clear legislative intent.

In conclusion, applying these established judicial review principles, this Court finds the federal defendants’ motion for partial judgment on the pleadings regarding the non-reviewability of Section 2740(b) based on implied legislative intent to preclude review is without merit.
