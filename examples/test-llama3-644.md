The petitioner, Richard S., challenges his continued confinement in a non-secure facility, arguing that the state courts unreasonably refused to extend the United States Supreme Court's holding in Kansas v. Crane (534 U.S. 407, 122 S.Ct. 867, 151 L.Ed.2d 856) to his case. The petitioner contends that Crane requires the state to prove that he is mentally ill, dangerous, and has serious difficulty in controlling his behavior.

The Supreme Court in Crane held that a State can civilly commit a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes them likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence. The Court emphasized that the commitment must be based on a finding of serious difficulty in controlling behavior.

Here, the state courts did not unreasonably refuse to extend Crane to the petitioner's case. The petitioner's commitment is based on a finding of mental illness and dangerousness, as required by New York law. The state courts properly considered the petitioner's history of violent behavior, including the stabbing of a 15-year-old boy, and the need for continued treatment to protect himself and others.

In conclusion, the state courts did not unreasonably refuse to extend Crane to the petitioner's case. The petitioner's commitment is based on a finding of mental illness and dangerousness, and the state courts properly considered the need for continued treatment to protect himself and others. Therefore, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is denied and dismissed. <answer>
