In this context, referencing relevant case law is crucial. Notably, in 243 F.3d 1367, the court endorsed the government's interpretation of its regulations over the contractual obligations imposed on a contractor, indicating deference to agency expertise in regulatory matters. Similarly, in 106 F.3d 1456, the court upheld that regulatory obligations can be independent of contractual breaches, aligning with the BSEE's stance that decommissioning duties remain enforceable despite the government's breach of Noble Energy's lease. These precedents support the BSEE's interpretation under which regulatory decommissioning obligations persist independently of any common-law discharge due to a breached contract.

gold_text: In still other cases, courts have concluded that common law principles helped to interpret the meaning of a specific statutory or regulatory scheme as a result of the particular interplay between the common law rule and the statutory or regulatory scheme in question. See, e.g., Ins. Co. of the West v. United States, 243 F.3d 1367, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2001) (common law rights of assignees unchanged by waiver of sovereign immunity in Tucker Act); In re Niles, 106 F.3d 1456, 1461 (9th Cir.1997) (common law allocation of burdens of proof bolsters conclusions regarding burden of proof under Bankruptcy Act provision). Taken together, these cases confirm that there is no general principle — as Plaintiff maintains — that a common law principle ' like the discharge rule should be automati-. cally read into a regulatory scheme such as the one at issue here. These case do establish that explicit language — at least more explicit than presented in this case— would be necessary to abrogate the discharge rule itself. Importantly, however, BSEE has not abrogated that rule, which by its own terms applies to contractual obligations. BSEE concluded that the regulatory requirements regarding decommissioning are independent of the contractual decommissioning obligations, and, for the reasons stated above, this conclusion is not “plainly erroneous” or “inconsistent with the regulation.” There is no principle in the case law that would require this Court to read into the independent regulatory decommissioning requirements a version of the discharge rule. In sum, none of Plaintiffs arguments lead the Court to conclude that the agency’s order is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Accordingly, BSEE’s order requiring Noble Energy to carry out its regulatory decommissioning obligations regarding Well OCS-P 0320, No. 2, survives this Court’s deferential standard of review.
