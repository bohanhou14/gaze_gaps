gold_text: Admittedly, the dichotomy is not exact. Some hotels provide only minimal services, while some landlords do provide services to tenants. The Court, however, concludes, that on balance this dichotomy is further evidence that hotel revenues are not rents, but an account. This conclusion is consistent with the majority of court which have addressed this issue. See e.g., In re Miami Center Associates, Ltd., 144 B.R. at 941; In re Majestic Motel Associates, Inc., 131 B.R. 523 (Bankr.D.Me.1991); In re Shore Haven Motor Inn, Inc., 124 B.R. 617 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1991); In re Vickers, Ltd., 111 B.R. 332 (D.Colo.1990) In re Ashkenazy Enterprises, Inc., 94 B.R. 645 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.1986); In re Kearney Hotel Partners, 92 B.R. 95 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1988). But See In re S.F. Drake Hotel Associates, 131 B.R. at 158-161 (room charges are more like rent than an account).
