HEANEY, Circuit Judge.

In construing the responsibilities pertaining to the Annette Islands Reservation, as referenced in case 248 U.S. 78 and 39 S.Ct. 40, the court determined that the reservation set aside by the Act of 1891 includes not only the upland of the islands but also the adjacent waters and submerged land. This construction hinges on discerning Congress's intent and the circumstances surrounding the creation of the reservation, including the needs of the Indians and the objectives at hand.

Similar to the case at hand, national jurisdiction and the legislative power of Congress over the reservation were asserted, solidifying the foundation that encompassed both land and adjacent waters. References like Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1, further reinforce this inclusive interpretation, notably as the entire dominion and sovereignty rested within the United States jurisdiction.

Turning to the legal obligations of the BIA, IHS, and the Tribe, according to 532 F.2d 655, these extend beyond straightforward land use to encompass broader activities including waste management on reservation land. The enforcement of compliance within these legal frameworks underscores the shared responsibility for environmental stewardship and health safeguards on reservation lands.

In sum, the analysis and references highlight the comprehensive scope of jurisdiction and responsibility that federal and tribal entities hold over reservation lands, reinforcing the duty to ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

Congress intended the obligations of BIA and IHS under the RCRA to be exercised consistent with their trust obligation. Accord State of Washington Depâ€™t. of Ecology, 752 F.2d at 1470 (1985). See also, Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, 248 U.S. 78, 89, 39 S.Ct. 40, 42, 63 L.Ed. 138 (1918) (construe ambiguous statutes in favor of Indians); Santa Rosa Band of Indians v. Kings County, 532 F.2d 655, 660 (9th Cir.1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1038, 97 S.Ct. 731, 50 L.Ed.2d 748 (1977) (same). BIA and IHS have not merely violated the RCRA, but, in so doing, they have violated their fiduciary obligation toward the plaintiffs and the Tribe. They are required to insure that the dumps are cleaned up, even if others contributed to the problem and even if the RCRA does not clearly set forth what role BIA and IHS are to play under the statute.
