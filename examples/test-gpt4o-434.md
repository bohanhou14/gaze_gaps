Given the ALJ's failure to adequately address and weigh the medical opinions of the treating psychologists, the decision must be scrutinized under established legal standards. It is well-settled that opinions of treating physicians should be given greater weight than those of physicians hired by the Secretary who only examined the claimant once (773 F.2d 85; 980 F.2d 1066). Moreover, the ALJ must provide good reasons for rejecting the treating physician’s conclusions, and must not base the determination on a selective reading of the record (837 F.2d 272; 375 F.3d 387).

Furthermore, the ALJ’s credibility determinations regarding the plaintiff’s subjective complaints must be grounded in substantial evidence. As noted in cases such as Duncan v. Secretary of Health & Human Services, subjective claims must be supported by objective medical evidence (987 F.2d 1230). The record must present a balanced view of both supporting and contradictory evidence, ensuring that the claimant's residual functional capacity is properly assessed (336 F.3d 469).

In light of these precedents, the ALJ’s decision lacks the substantial evidence needed to uphold the denial of benefits. Consequently, the Court reverses the findings of the ALJ and remands the case back to the Social Security Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

gold_text: A Rule promulgated by the Secretary states that: “more weight [will be given] to opinions from your treating sources, since these sources are likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed, longitudinal picture of your medical impairment(s) and may bring a unique perspective to the medical evidence that cannot be obtained from the objective medical findings alone or reports of individual examinations, such as consultative examinations or brief hospitalizations.” 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(2). The Sixth Circuit has consistently applied this rule. A treating physician’s opinion should be given greater weight than those opinions of consultative physicians who are hired for the purpose of litigation and who examine the claimant only once. See Jones v. Sec.’y of Health & Human Services, 945 F.2d 1365, 1370 n. 7 (6th Cir.1991); Farris v. Sec’y of Health & Human Services, 773 F.2d 85, 90 (6th Cir.1985). If a treating physician’s opinion is not contradicted, complete deference must be given to it. Walker v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 980 F.2d 1066, 1070 (6th Cir.1992); King v. Heckler, 742 F.2d 968, 973 (6th Cir.1984). However, a treating physician’s opinion may be rejected if there is good reason to do so. Hall v. Bowen, 837 F.2d 272, 276 (6th Cir.1988). The Sixth Circuit has held that treating physicians’ opinions “are only given such deference when supported by objective clinical evidence.” Warner v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 375 F.3d 387, 390 (6th Cir.2004) (citing Jones v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 336 F.3d 469, 477 (6th Cir.2003)). Where a treating physician renders an opinion using legal language as opposed to medical terminology, the Court likewise may reject it if it is not supported by clinical evidence in the record. See Casey v. Sec’y of Health & Human Services, 987 F.2d 1230, 1234-35 (6th Cir.1993).
