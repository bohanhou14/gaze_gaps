C. Bivins’s Substantive Reasonableness Challenge to His Sentence

Bivins challenges the substantive reasonableness of his 235-month sentence. We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard, considering the totality of the circumstances and the extent to which the § 3553(a) factors support the sentence imposed (550 F.3d 1319). A sentence within the Guidelines range may be presumed reasonable, though this presumption is not required (552 U.S. 38).

Here, Bivins was subject to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) enhancement due to prior felony convictions, elevating his sentencing range significantly. The district court considered the advisory Guidelines range and the § 3553(a) factors, including promoting respect for the law, deterring criminal conduct, and protecting the public (611 F.3d 1371).

The district court did not make a "clear error of judgment" nor impose "a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case" (550 F.3d 1319). Despite Bivins's arguments, the district court's thorough consideration of the circumstances and statutory factors indicates no abuse of discretion in the final sentencing decision.

Thus, Bivins’s sentence is substantively reasonable. We find no reversible error; Bivins’s conviction and sentence are affirmed.

gold_text: Bivins does not challenge his guidelines calculations, but Bivins does argue that his 235-month sentence was substantively unreasonable. We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A defendant challenging his sentence bears the burden of showing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the § 3553(a) factors. United States v. Tome, 611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). Although this Court does not presume that a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a within-guidelines range sentence will be deemed reasonable. United States v. Gonzalez, 550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).
