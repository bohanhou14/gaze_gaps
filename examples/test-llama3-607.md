The case of Jameson v. United States (reference case 764 F.2d 322) presents a situation where the taxpayer, Kolom, exercised company stock options and paid a minimum tax on the bargain element. Kolom's tax return for 1972 reported the stock options, but he did not include the bargain element as a tax preference item. Instead, he deferred reporting the item until he could sell the shares and retain the profits. In 1973, Kolom included the bargain element as a tax preference item and paid the minimum tax. The IRS assessed a deficiency for 1972, and Kolom filed a claim for refund.

The court held that the mitigation provisions did not apply, as the sale of the stock options did not affect gross income as required by IRC § 1312(1). The court also applied the doctrine of equitable recoupment, finding that a single transaction (the sale of the stock options) gave rise to both the tax paid by Kolom in 1973 and the deficiency assessed by the IRS for 1972. The court concluded that Kolom was entitled to a refund of the minimum tax paid in 1973.

In comparison, Reference case 752 F.2d 518 (United States v. Rushlight) relates to the doctrine of equitable recoupment, but it does not involve stock options or tax preferences. The court in Rushlight held that the doctrine of equitable recoupment applies when a single transaction constitutes the taxable event claimed upon and the one considered in recoupment.

In conclusion, the Jameson v. United States case highlights the importance of considering the doctrine of equitable recoupment in situations where tax preferences are involved. The court's decision emphasizes the need for careful analysis of the tax implications of stock options and other complex tax transactions.

gold_text: . Kolom I held that despite the restriction imposed on the sale of Kolom’s stock by § 16(b) of the Act, Kolom owed a minimum tax on the options’ bargain element in the year of exercise, 1972. Although the Supreme Court denied cer-tiorari, Justice Powell's dissent highlighted the inequities of the Kolom I holding. As a result, Congress passed an amendment excepting the options’ bargain element from minimum tax until after the lapse of the six month sale restriction of § 16(b) of the Act. IRC § 83(c)(3). This is the exact treatment Kolom accorded the exercise of his 1972 stock options. However, the amendment only applied to transfers made after December 31, 1981. Courts, addressing issues similar to those presented in Kolom I, now rule in favor of the taxpayer. See generally McDonald v. CIR, 764 F.2d 322 (5th Cir.1985) (holding Treas.Reg. § 1.57-l(f) inapplicable to lapse restriction imposed on qualified stock options); Estate of Gresham v. CIR, 752 F.2d 518 (10th Cir.1985).
