**Generation:**

The incidents on January 30 at the Mears plant closely parallel the coercive conduct observed in other landmark cases. As articulated in 340 F.2d 71, threats and actions that intimidate employees from exercising their rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) are clear violations. Just as the court found in case 340 F.2d 71, the presence and encouragement of union officials and their failure to disperse the crowd substantiate their liability.

As further supported by 233 F.2d 541, the significant differences in assumptions and intentions between parties must be scrutinized carefully. Here, the UMW's pre-arranged and coordinated efforts exemplify the coercive tactics expressly condemned by the NLRA. The mass picketing, threats of violence, and interference with lawful union activities exhibit blatant disregard for the legal protections afforded to employees, akin to the principles established in case 233 F.2d 541.

The evidence undeniably supports the conclusion that the UMW and its representatives, through their actions and inactions, violated Section 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act by creating an environment of fear and coercion. Therefore, the Board's determination and enforcement of penalties against the respondents are affirmed.

The burning of the dynamited Mears Company office building was plainly action taken in consonance with the earlier made threats against the Company for employing SLU members. We concur in the Board’s finding that respondents UMW and District 2 are liable for this illegal conduct.
