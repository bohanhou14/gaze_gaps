In reaching our conclusion, we find support from analogous rulings. For instance, in reference case 348 F.3d 1153, the court emphasized the deference given to the IJ's credibility findings and upheld the denial of asylum and withholding of removal due to a lack of credible evidence. Similarly, the credibility of the petitioner's assertions was critical, and discrepancies in testimony contributed significantly to the adverse decision, underscoring the weight given to consistent and believable accounts.

Furthermore, as demonstrated in reference case 336 F.3d 989, the BIA must have specific, cogent reasons for questioning a petitioner’s credibility, particularly when discrepancies in the petitioner’s statements undermine the core of their asylum claim. The court affirmed an adverse credibility finding based on significant geographical inconsistencies that called into question the veracity of the persecution claims.

Applying this precedent to Loho's case, her voluntary returns to Indonesia, coupled with her insufficient steps to seek asylum during multiple stays in the U.S., provide substantial grounds for the IJ’s adverse credibility determination. This aligns with the principles laid out in the above cases, where inconsistencies and the petitioner’s actions in their home country were pivotal in discrediting their fear of persecution claims.

Therefore, based on the comparisons drawn from these reference cases (336 F.3d 989 and 348 F.3d 1153), we affirm the BIA's decision which in turn supports the IJ’s findings, concluding that Loho has not met the burden of proof required for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under CAT.

gold_text: Because Loho’s asylum claim fails, she necessarily cannot satisfy the more stringent standard of proof required to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. See Farah v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Moreover, in light of the IJ’s adverse credibility finding, we are satisfied that substantial evidence supports denial of Loho’s claim under CAT. See Malhi v. INS, 336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that relief under CAT requires a showing that “it is ‘more likely than not’ that [the petitioner] will be tortured if returned to [his native land]” (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2))); see also Farah, 348 F.3d at 1157 (noting that “[the petitioner’s] claims under the Convention Against Torture are based on the same statements ... that the BIA determined to be not credible”).
