**Generation:**

This case presents the question of whether the district court's judgments of acquittal on counts sixteen and seventeen, following a post-verdict motion, are appealable under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Similar issues were addressed in **United States v. Wilson**, **420 U.S. 332**, where the Supreme Court held that the prosecution may appeal a judgment of acquittal following a jury's guilty verdict because such an appeal does not require a retrial, thus not violating the Double Jeopardy Clause. The principle discussed in **Wilson** was reiterated in **United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.**, **430 U.S. 564**, confirming that an appeal by the government is permissible when the appellate court can simply reinstate the jury's guilty verdict without further factual examination.

Furthermore, the Supreme Court in **Rumsey**, **476 U.S. 140**, drew a clear distinction between cases where the appeal would lead to additional factfinding, which is barred under the Double Jeopardy Clause, and those where it would not, thereby permitting the appeal. Here, as in **Wilson** and **Martin Linen**, the government seeks only the reinstatement of the original guilty verdicts on counts sixteen and seventeen, focusing purely on legal sufficiency rather than necessitating a retrial or exposing Greer to multiple prosecutions. Therefore, following the precedent, we reverse the district court’s judgments of acquittal and remand with instructions to enter judgments in accordance with the jury’s verdicts of guilty.

gold_text: . In Burns, we relied on the reasoning similar to that used in United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975), where the Supreme Court held that the government can appeal a postverdict judgment of acquittal ordered because of pretrial delay. The Court reasoned in Wilson that an appeal under that circumstance would not result in the defendant being twice placed in jeopardy because if the appellate court reversed the trial court, the jury’s verdict could be reinstated without further factfinding proceedings. Id. at 352, 95 S.Ct. at 1026. Since Wilson, the Court has continued to emphasize that the evil against which the double jeopardy clause protects is postacquittal exposure of the defendant to further factfinding proceedings. See, e.g., Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U.S. 140, 145 & n. 8, 106 S.Ct. 1745, 1749 & n. 8, 90 L.Ed.2d 116 (1986); United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977).
