To answer your question, I must consult the reference cases provided. According to case 202 F.3d 89, the doctrine of collateral estoppel is applied by reviewing a district court's application of collateral estoppel de novo, accepting all factual findings of the district court unless clearly erroneous. In this case, the district court's application of collateral estoppel is based on an erroneous belief that the Civil Court's April decision resulted in a case separate and distinct from the Civil Court's February decision.

In case 13 F.3d 577, the court declined to address an issue that was not raised below, citing a lack of reason for the failure to raise it and noting that there would be no great injustice if it refused to resolve the issue.

In light of these reference cases, it is clear that the district court's application of collateral estoppel is flawed and must be vacated. The court's factual findings are not clearly erroneous, but the legal conclusion of collateral estoppel lacks factual support. Therefore, the contempt order should be vacated, and the injunction should be modified to align with the terms of the consent decree.

I hope this answer is helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions. <answer>

gold_text: Ordinarily, we review de novo a district court’s decision regarding collateral estoppel. See Chartier v. Marlin Mgmt., LLC, 202 F.3d 89, 93 (2d Cir.2000). Although defendants raise collateral estoppel for the first time on appeal, they are correct that the claim arose only after the district court delivered its opinion. See Greene v. United States, 13 F.3d 577, 586 (2d Cir.1994) (stating that it is “well-established ... that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal,” but that exceptions are made, for instance, “to remedy an obvious injustice”). Defendants allege that the district court’s 2002 contempt order recasts its 1996 findings. Specifically, defendants claim that the district court changed its view of Dr. Silberman’s role in the events giving rise to the 1996 contempt ruling against the Hospital and DOPS. We review this claim, but find the court’s 2002 statements regarding Dr. Silberman to be entirely consistent with its earlier holding. For this reason, we conclude that the collateral estoppel defense is likewise without merit.
