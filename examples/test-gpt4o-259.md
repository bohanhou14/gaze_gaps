In considering Camille’s First Amendment claim against Section 1(E) of the East Moline ordinance, we turn to reference cases to elucidate the constitutional bounds surrounding commercial speech restrictions. According to case 679 F.2d 1, commercial speech does not fall outside the protections of the First Amendment merely because it is commercial; however, the government may regulate speech related to illegal activities. Similarly, in case 673 F.2d 1213, the court held that regulation of advertisements promoting drug paraphernalia targets commercial activity promoting illegal drug use, thus fitting within permissible regulatory scope.

Additionally, case 651 F.2d 551 emphasizes that statutes circumscribing commercial speech are justifiable when the speech promotes illegal activity and do not violate constitutional parameters given the lesser protection afforded to commercial speech. These precedents collectively indicate that Section 1(E) of the East Moline ordinance, which prohibits advertisements promoting drug paraphernalia, withstands constitutional scrutiny as it aims to curtail commercial speech associated with illicit activities.

Therefore, applying these standards, Camille’s First Amendment claim challenging Section 1(E) of the East Moline ordinance must be rejected as the provision fits within the acceptable limits of regulating commercial speech that promotes illegal conduct.
