IX. Analysis of Procedural Challenges

In addressing procedural due process, it is imperative to distinguish between interests derived from state law and those created by the Constitution. As noted in 943 F.2d 129, "[...] procedural due process even though the interest is derived from state law rather than the Constitution." The plaintiff, however, cannot rely merely on the misapplication of state law to assert a procedural due process claim.

In the context of substantive due process, which requires a violation of a fundamental constitutional right, the court must apply caution and restraint (680 F.2d 822). This distinction is critical in evaluating whether Dr. McCann’s claim warrants substantive due process protection. The court found Dr. McCann's reliance on procedural due process cases inapposite when analyzing his substantive due process arguments. 

X. Conclusion

Based on the principles and precedents discussed, the Court concludes that the plaintiff's substantive due process claim lacks merit as it does not transgress basic and fundamental constitutional principles. Thus, the claim is dismissed, and the corresponding $175,000.00 awarded by the jury is vacated. The other aspects of the jury's verdict are adjusted according to the findings of this Order.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

Based on this standard, the circuit has held that a regulatory board does not transgress constitutional due process requirements merely by making decisions "for erroneous reasons" or by making "demands which arguably exceed its authority under the relevant state statutes” (Creative Environments, Inc. v.

Moran, 904 F.2d at 757 (citations omitted)), and that the "right to pursue ... employment free from emotional health risks resulting from [a] supervisor's verbal harassment” does not warrant substantive due process protection {Santiago de Castro v. Morales Medina, 943 F.2d 129 (1st Cir.1991)).
