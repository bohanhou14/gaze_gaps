In evaluating whether the district court properly exercised its subject-matter jurisdiction, we are mindful of the established principle that challenges to jurisdiction can be asserted at any stage before final judgment. As highlighted in Vacek v. U.S. Postal Service, sovereign immunity is a fundamental limitation on jurisdiction (636 F.3d 1190; 447 F.3d 1248, 1253). Similarly, in Sinochem Int'l Co. v. Malaysia Int'l Shipping Corp., the Supreme Court reiterated that judicial economy and proper jurisdictional determinations should precede a deep dive into the merits of the case (549 U.S. 422).

Moreover, any claims against the government must respect the unequivocally expressed waivers of sovereign immunity. Here, Al-Haramain’s reliance on §1810 fails to manifest such a waiver, contrary to the explicit waivers evident in other statutory contexts as upheld in past cases (549 U.S. at 433; Grupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. 567).

Given the absence of an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity in §1810 and the requirement for unequivocal congressional intent, we reverse the district court's judgment. We also affirm the dismissal of claims against Director Mueller, recognizing that the allegations do not meet the required threshold for individual liability under FISA.

In light of these findings and established precedents, we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with these jurisdictional limitations (636 F.3d at 1190; 549 U.S. at 422).

In light of our decision on sovereign immunity, we need not address the constitutional and prudential standing issues, nor the question of statutory standing, namely whether Al-Haramain meets the "aggrieved person” requirement of 50 U.S.C. § 1810. See Sinochem Int’l Co. v. Malay.
