In the case of L.B. Smith, Inc. v. Trustee of Stebow Construction Co., Inc., the court was tasked with determining whether a financing statement filed under the name "Stebow Excavating Co., Inc." rather than the debtor's correct name, "Ste-bow Construction Co., Inc.", was sufficient to perfect a security interest. The court cited the Official Comment to N.J.S.A. § 12A:9-402, which states that a financing statement need not be precisely accurate to be effective, so long as a reasonable search under the debtor's correct name would reveal the filing.

The court also noted that the UCC indexing system maintained by the State of New Jersey requires that the filing officer search only for financing statements bearing the exact name provided to them. Therefore, a search by an employee of the Office of the Secretary of State made at the request of creditors or by the Trustee would not disclose the alleged security interest held by L.B. Smith, Inc. since the name of the debtor on the financing statement does not match the name provided to the Secretary of State.

In reaching its decision, the court looked to the case of In re Kittyhawk Television Corp., 516 F.2d 24 (6th Cir.1975), which held that a financing statement listing the debtor's name as "Kittyhawk Broadcasting Corporation" when the debtor's name had been changed to "Kittyhawk Television Corporation" was valid. The court noted that the names of the debtor were sufficiently similar that a third party could reasonably be expected to be put on notice or at least to be required to make further inquiry.

gold_text: In the present case, the court concludes that the use by L.B. Smith, Inc. of debtor’s trade name, Stebow Excavating Co., Inc., instead of its corporate name, Stebow Construction Co., Inc., in the financing statement is not a minor error and is seriously misleading within the meaning of N.J.S.A. § 12A:9-402(8) (formerly § 12A:9-402(5)), see fn. 2, supra), and that the financing statement does not substantially comply with the requirements of N.J. S.A. § 12A-.9-402. This is not a case where the financing statement merely fails to indicate the debtor is a corporation or uses a word that is basically synonymous with a word in the debtor’s name so that a diligent searcher would be put on notice to make further inquiry or conclude that Stebow Excavating Co., Inc. and Stebow Construction Co., Inc. identify the same entity. According to the stipulated facts herein, Ste-bow Excavating Co., Inc. is an unregistered trade name occasionally utilized by the debtor, so that a diligent searcher would not be more likely to discover this filing then one in the correct name of Stebow Construction Co., Inc. Nor is this a case as in Kittyhawk where there was no error in the original filing statement. Moreover, cases which hold that a creditor who is seeking to avoid a security interest had actual knowledge of the incorrect name on the financing statement so as to hold the security interest perfected are inapplicable to a case such as the present one. Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 544(a), the trustee’s avoiding powers are without regard to any knowledge of the trustee or any creditor. See In re Sportswear Shoppe Ltd., 15 B.R. 970, 975 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Mo.1981). This does not mean the name appearing on the financing statement must be absolutely perfect. “The trustee in bankruptcy is considered to be in the position of a hypothetical but prudent creditor.” Matter of Glasco, Inc., 642 F.2d 793, 796 (5th Cir.1981). The trustee cannot be charged with actual knowledge but should be taken to stand in the shoes of an ideal creditor who had no notice of the trade name used herein. An error that is seriously misleading is sufficient to allow the trustee to avoid the security interest. See In re Amsco Inc., 26 B.R. 358, 363 (Bkrtcy.D.Conn.1982). The court holds, therefore, that the security interest alleged by L.B. Smith, Inc. in the subject equipment was not perfected due to an error in the UCC-1 Financing Statement filed with the Secretary of State of the State of New Jersey on or about March 17, 1980. Accordingly, the trustee may avoid this alleged security interest in the subject equipment. The counterclaim of L.B. Smith, Inc. seeking a judgment that it has a valid, perfected and enforceable security interest in and to the subject equipment superior to and prior to the Trustee is denied.
