1. Standard of Review for Severance
Barron's contention that the district court erred by severing the claims of the seven plaintiffs is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 21, any claim against a party may be severed and proceeded with separately (Reference case 956 F.2d 1112). Courts will not disturb such decisions absent clear evidentiary support suggesting an abuse of discretion, as stated in T.D.S. Inc. v. Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., 760 F.2d 1520, 1535 (11th Cir.1985).

2. Juror Exclusion
Barron did not challenge a juror exclusion similar to the discussed issue in Johns Caldwell and Hayes, providing minimal grounds for considering abusive jury selection (Reference case 956 F.2d 1112).

3. Rule 60(b)(4) Compliance
Regarding Barron's claim procedure concerns, in a Rule 60(b)(4) motion, the burden rests with the defendant to prove the judgment's voidness, particularly regarding service of process impacting personal jurisdiction and due process (Reference case 328 F.3d 1291). Thus, absence of such critical procedural flaws in Barron's case affirms denial of reversal.

Therefore, based on the substantial precedent and Barron's failure to illustrate a notable severance error, the district court's orders remain affirmed.

gold_text: Ordinarily, we review a district court’s grant of a motion to sever for an abuse of discretion. See Bailey v. Board of County Comm’rs of Alachua County, Fla., 956 F.2d 1112, 1128 (11th Cir.1992). When a party fails to raise an argument or issue below, we generally deem the issue to be waived. See e.g., Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, 377 F.3d at 1168-69. Nevertheless, we may review an issue or argument not raised below when: (1) it involves “a pure question of law if the refusal to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice”; (2) the objection is not raised in the court below because “the appellant had no opportunity to raise the objection”; (3) “there is at stake a substantial interest of justice”; (4) “the proper resolution is beyond any doubt”; and (5) “if the issue presents significant questions of general impact or great public concern.” In re Worldwide Web Systems, Inc., 328 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.2003).
