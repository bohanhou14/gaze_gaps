Mr. Gutierrez's claim that the district court failed to adequately elaborate on its consideration of the § 3553(a) factors lacks merit. The district court’s acknowledgment that it reviewed the presentence report and considered the § 3553(a) factors and advisory guidelines suffices to demonstrate proper consideration, as explicitly noted in reference cases 426 F.3d 1324 and 522 F.3d 1255. The court's explicit mention of having reviewed all relevant factors aligns with United States v. Scott, where the mere acknowledgment of considering those factors was deemed sufficient (426 F.3d at 1330). 

Regarding substantive reasonableness, Mr. Gutierrez challenges both the length of his sentence and the court’s consideration of his mitigating evidence. However, the imposed sentence, being at the lower end of the guidelines range, falls within the expected realm of reasonableness (Scott, 426 F.3d at 1329-30; 522 F.3d 1255). The district court's decision to impose a sentence at the guidelines range, alongside specific consideration of Mr. Gutierrez’s financial inability to pay fines, indicates a tailored and individualized sentence, contrary to Mr. Gutierrez’s assertion of robotic sentencing.

In sum, the district court did not err procedurally by failing to elaborate on each § 3553(a) factor, nor was the sentence substantively unreasonable. The court’s explicit acknowledgment of the factors and the tailored considerations made it sufficiently clear that a thoughtful, individualized sentencing process took place (522 F.3d 1255; Scott, 426 F.3d at 1329-30).

gold_text: Although the district court could have said more, it said enough on this record. “[W]e have held that a court’s explicit ac knowledgment that it has considered a defendant’s arguments and the § 3553(a) factors is sufficient to demonstrate that it has adequately and properly considered those factors.” United States v. Ellisor, 522 F.3d 1255, 1278 (11th Cir.2008). We have also “squarely h[e]ld that nothing ... requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the § 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the § 3553(a) factors” for a sentence to be procedurally sound. United States v. Scott, 426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, Mr. Gutierrez’s sentence is procedurally reasonable.
