The cases of Shemtob v. Shearson, Hammill & Co. (448 F.2d 442) and Hochfelder v. Drexel & Co. (86 F.R.D. 66) provide valuable insights into the legal principles governing securities fraud cases. In Shemtob, the Second Circuit dismissed a complaint alleging a violation of ยง 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, holding that mere negligence was insufficient to sustain a cause of action and that there must be allegations of scienter, intent to defraud, or reckless disregard for the truth.

Similarly, in Hochfelder, the court emphasized that mere negligence is insufficient to sustain a ยง 10(b) violation and that there must be allegations of scienter or intent to defraud. The court in Admimiralty Fund v. Rawlings (unpublished) applied these principles, affirming the dismissal of a cross-claim against City National Bank (CNB) for failure to state a claim. The court held that the allegations against CNB were insufficient, as they did not specify any wrongdoing or misconduct on the part of the bank.

In conclusion, the cases of Shemtob and Hochfelder establish the importance of alleging scienter or intent to defraud in securities fraud cases, while the case of Admimiralty Fund v. Rawlings illustrates the need for specific allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct to state a claim against a third party. These principles are essential for ensuring that securities fraud cases are properly pleaded and that defendants are protected from baseless claims. <answer>

It failed to allege any facts demonstrating knowledge and participation sufficient to impose liability on the bank. Under similar circumstances, when a complaint failed to al lege the required scienter, it was properly dismissed with prejudice. Shemtob v.
