The cases provided, 316 U.S. 517 and 327 U.S. 178, are relevant to the analysis of whether the night watchman is engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce. In the case of Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517, the Supreme Court held that employees engaged in activities necessary to the production of goods for commerce are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The Court emphasized that the FLSA's applicability depends on the character of the employees' activities, not the physical process of making the goods.

In the case of Walling v. Sondock, 327 U.S. 178, the Court further clarified that employees who contribute materially to the consummation of transactions in interstate commerce are engaged in commerce as defined by the FLSA. The Court also noted that the FLSA does not require employees to participate in the physical process of making goods before being regarded as engaged in their production.

Applying these principles to the case at hand, it is clear that the night watchman is engaged in commerce and the production of goods for commerce. As a watchman, his duties are essential to the protection and security of the warehouse, offices, and merchandise, which are all part of the production and distribution process for interstate commerce. His activities contribute materially to the flow of goods in commerce, and he is therefore covered by the FLSA.

In conclusion, the night watchman's duties and activities are closely tied to the production and distribution of goods for interstate commerce, making him engaged in commerce and the production of goods for commerce. The cases of Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517, and Walling v. Sondock, 327 U.S. 178, support this conclusion and demonstrate the importance of considering the character of an employee's activities in determining FLSA coverage.

gold_text: Here, it is without dispute that the night watchman guards appellant’s entire premises and property, including the loading platform, the interstate shipments loaded in the freight cars and trucks, and the warehouse building in which a percentage of the coffee and rice was being prepared for interstate shipment. Under such circumstances, we are constrained to believe that the night watchman, while guarding the warehouse in which the interstate shipments were being processed for distribution, was in some measure also engaged in the “production of goods for commerce”, within the coverage of the Act.
