B. Privacy Act Claims Against Other Agencies

1. The State Department

Plaintiff did not submit a Privacy Act request to the State Department, as evidenced by the lack of any record in the Department's automated case tracking system. Consequently, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not exhausted administrative remedies with respect to claims against the State Department. See 535 F.3d 697; 333 F.3d 273.

2. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)

Plaintiff's submission to the DEA did not challenge the accuracy of records or demand their correction; therefore, the DEA's records were not addressed under the standards required by the Privacy Act. This further indicates failure to exhaust administrative remedies (535 F.3d 697).

3. Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA)

Similarly, Plaintiff's requests to the EOUSA did not address inaccuracies or seek corrections. This shows non-compliance with required administrative procedures, justifying summary judgment in favor of defendants (333 F.3d 273).

C. Implications of Existing Comprehensive Remedial Schemes

Drawing parallels to Chung v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 333 F.3d 273, and relying on precedents such as Wilkie v. Robbins, 535 F.3d 697, the Court notes that a comprehensive remedial scheme like the Privacy Act precludes the implication of further remedies, such as Bivens actions, particularly when sensitive intelligence information might be disclosed (535 F.3d 697).

D. Conclusion on Privacy Act and Related Claims

Given that Plaintiff did not adequately follow administrative procedures, and considering the exemptions applicable to federal agencies' record-keeping under the Privacy Act (535 F.3d 697), Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Defendants' motion is thus granted in full.

gold_text: To the extent that plaintiff alleges defendants' violations of rights protected by the United States Constitution, see Compl. at 2, these claims must be dismissed. The Privacy Act provides a comprehensive remedial scheme for a government agency’s failure to maintain records with the requisite level of accuracy or to amend such records. See Wilson v. Libby, 535 F.3d 697, 709-10 (D.C.Cir.2008) (comprehensive remedial scheme in Privacy Act precludes remedy for damages claim for constitutional violations under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971)); Chung v. United States Dep't of Justice, 333 F.3d 273, 274 (D.C.Cir.2003) (affirming “dismissal of Chung’s constitutional claims because, as the district court correctly held, they are encompassed within the remedial scheme of the Privacy Act”).
