Based on the provided reference cases, I will analyze the disputed items of cost and determine whether they are taxable or not. 

The first item of cost is the fees for certification and photocopying of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case ($1,160.51). According to reference case 46 F.R.D. 635, the court must examine the proof submitted by the plaintiff to determine whether the fees are taxable. The court found that the proof submitted was not sufficient to sustain taxation of these fees, except for the fees related to the "Kollokationplan" which may be taxed if proof of the amount is submitted to the clerk.

The second item of cost is the daily transcripts of the trial and pretrial hearings ($2,003.20). According to reference case 422 F.2d 1278, the court considered the matter on a post-trial motion and denied the item. The court held that the matter was one for the discretion of the trial judge, and since it did not believe that the ruling was an abuse of discretion, it will not interfere with it.

The third item of cost is the costs incurred in the preparation of certain charts and taking certain depositions. These costs were denied by the judgment clerk of this court. After analyzing the reference cases, I conclude that these costs are not taxable.

In conclusion, based on the reference cases, the fees for certification and photocopying of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case ($1,160.51) are not taxable, except for the fees related to the "Kollokationplan" which may be taxed if proof of the amount is submitted to the clerk. The daily transcripts of the trial and pretrial hearings ($2,003.20) are not taxable. The costs incurred in the preparation of certain charts and taking certain depositions are also not taxable.

gold_text: Typically a showing must be made that the action presented some particularly involved and complex factual or legal issues before the cost of a daily transcript may be recovered. See Oscar Gruss & Son v. Lumberman’s Mutual Casualty Co., 46 F.R.D. 635 (S.D.N.Y.1969), aff’d., 422 F.2d 1278 (2d Cir. 1970). No such showing is possible in this case. The court finds that the daily transcript was not “necessarily obtained” for use in this case. 28 U.S.C. § 1920.
