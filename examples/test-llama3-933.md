In the context of legal cases, the concept of substantial evidence is crucial in determining the validity of agency actions. According to the Supreme Court, substantial evidence is "more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion" (Consolidated Edison Co. v. Labor Board, 305 U.S. 197, 229 [59 S.Ct. 206, 216, 83 L.Ed. 126] (1938)). This standard is often applied in cases involving the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

In the case of Britting v. VA, the plaintiff, Susan E. Britting, claimed that she was discriminated against on the basis of her disability, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and challenged her termination from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA argued that Britting's IBS did not substantially limit a major life activity, as required by the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794(a)). The MSPB upheld the VA's decision, finding that Britting's IBS was not a disability.

In reviewing the case, the District Court applied the pre-ADAAA standard, which required a showing that the impairment had a permanent or long-term impact. The court concluded that Britting failed to establish a disability under this standard. On appeal, Britting argued that the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) should be applied retroactively, but the court rejected this argument, citing Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 280, 114 S.Ct. 1488, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994).

In summary, the court's decision in Britting v. VA was based on the pre-ADAAA standard, which required a showing of a permanent or long-term impact of the impairment. The court found that Britting failed to establish a disability under this standard, and the application of the ADAAA was rejected due to its lack of retroactive applicability. The case highlights the importance of applying the correct legal standard in determining the validity of agency actions and the impact of the ADAAA on disability discrimination claims.

Substantial evidence “ ‘means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.’” Bradley v. Veterans Admin., 900 F.2d 233, 234 (Fed.Cir.1990) (quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. Labor Bd., 305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). Our review of the record reveals that there is substantial evidence to support the VA’s actions.
