Parsons's Estate argues that the conviction for federal arson should be reversed based on insufficient evidence regarding the interstate commerce requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 844(i). In assessing this argument, we refer to multiple precedents. In Russell v. United States, the Supreme Court held that rental properties used in a commercial manner fell under § 844(i). The Court concluded that the statute applies when a property is used in an activity affecting commerce, directly supporting federal jurisdiction (995 F.2d 1357, Russell v. United States, 471 U.S. at 862). Additionally, it was held that privately owned residences not actively used for commercial purposes do not satisfy this requirement (299 F.3d 250). In our case, the hotel was commercial property actively used for interstate commerce activities, validating the application of § 844(i). Thus, Parsons's argument lacks merit, and the district court's decision is affirmed.

gold_text: Although Parsons concedes that his hotel may have been used in interstate commerce at some point, he argues that it was used only for local functions, such as dances, when it was destroyed by fire. Parsons thus argues that use of his hotel at the time of the fire does not satisfy the Jones requirement of “active employment for commercial purposes, and not merely a passive, passing, or past connection to commerce.” Jones, 529 U.S. at 855, 120 S.Ct. at 1910, 146 L.Ed.2d at 910. Despite the fact that Parsons’s hotel may have been closed for the winter season, a temporary cessation of activity does not place the hotel beyond the reach of 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) if there is intent to return to the stream of commerce. See United States v. Williams, 299 F.3d 250 (3d Cir.2002) (holding that arson of a vacant building available for rent constituted a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. § 844(f)); United States v. Martin, 63 F.3d 1422 (7th Cir.1995) (same); United States v. Turner, 995 F.2d 1357 (6th Cir.1993) (same). Because a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Parsons’s hotel was used in interstate commerce, we affirm his conviction for federal arson under 18 U.S.C. § 844®.
