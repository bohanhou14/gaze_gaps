The cases of 482 F.2d 569 and 459 F.2d 811 provide valuable insights into the legal framework surrounding employment discrimination claims. In the case of 482 F.2d 569, the court emphasized the importance of considering new acts occurring during the pendency of the charge before the EEOC, as long as they are reasonably related to the allegations of the EEOC charge. This ruling underscores the need for a nuanced approach to addressing employment discrimination, recognizing that the conduct in question may not always be limited to a specific timeframe.

In the case of 459 F.2d 811, the court addressed the issue of the statute of limitations in employment discrimination claims. The court held that a charge of discrimination must be filed with the EEOC within one hundred and eighty days of the alleged unlawful employment practice, and that any instance of discrimination in employment occurring prior to June 1, 1975, is barred by the statute of limitations. This ruling highlights the importance of timely filing of employment discrimination claims and the need for plaintiffs to comply with the relevant statutory requirements.

In light of these cases, it is clear that employment discrimination claims must be carefully considered, taking into account the specific facts and circumstances of each case. The courts will closely examine the timing and nature of the alleged discriminatory conduct, as well as the plaintiff's compliance with the relevant statutory requirements. By applying the principles set forth in these cases, parties can better navigate the complex legal landscape surrounding employment discrimination claims.

gold_text: Finally, Roberts has attempted to supplement her answer to Interrogatory No. 7 adding her discharge as an additional incident of discrimination. This incident of discrimination was not included in her EEOC charge since termination occurred after the EEOC had processed her charge. Roberts, however, did not attempt to file an EEOC charge based on her discharge. Generally, a court has no jurisdiction to entertain a complaint in a Title VII action based other than on the discrimination alleged in the EEOC charge and any discrimination like or reasonably related to the allegations of the EEOC charge, including new acts occurring during the pendency of the charge before the EEOC. See Oubichon v. North American Rockwell Corp., 482 F.2d 569, 571 (9th Cir. 1973). Discharge in retaliation for filing charges of discrimination and because of an employee’s sex is not an incident like or reasonably related to the allegation of sex discrimination resulting in unfair treatment in promotion, compensation, job assignments, training, job classification, testing, qualifications, seniority and hiring. See Moore v. Sunbeam Corp., 459 F.2d 811, 826 n.38 (7th Cir. 1972) (“[S]ince discharge was not encompassed within the charge filed with the EEOC, it may not form the basis for a complaint in the federal district court.”). See also Thomas v. Arizona Board of Regents, No. Civ. 78-141-TUC (D. Ariz. Sept. 18, 1978) (plaintiff’s claim of retaliatory harassment is materially different from the charge of sex discrimination in wages presented to the EEOC and thus the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the claim of retaliatory harassment). Plaintiff’s eleventh-hour attempt to include the claim of discrimination based on her discharge by supplementing her answer to Interrogatory No. 7, more-" over, has prejudiced the defendant’s opportunity to engage in additional discovery concerning a claim of discrimination in employment based on this incident. Thus, the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the claim, and even if the Court did have jurisdiction, the plaintiff is estopped to assert a claim of discrimination based on her discharge in this action. Therefore,
