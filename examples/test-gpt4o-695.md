The Court acknowledges that the Kedzioras’ new theory draws support from the decision in Highsmith, where the Seventh Circuit held that using an undisclosed formula for calculating early termination charges constitutes a technical violation of disclosure requirements under 15 U.S.C. § 1667a(ll) (Highsmith v. Chrysler Credit Corp., 18 F.3d 434). In light of this, the Kedzioras' argument is valid. However, the Kedzioras' attempt to introduce this legal theory at this stage is untimely, as it should have been raised earlier in the litigation process.

Moreover, the Court emphasizes that raising an argument for the first time in a motion for reconsideration is procedurally improper as established in Wilson v. Wilson, 46 F.3d 660, 667 (7th Cir. 1995), where late arguments are deemed waived. The assertion that the basis for the claim was unavailable until Highsmith was decided does not hold, as the underlying law in Section 1667a(ll) has not changed. Under In re Oil Spill by Amoco Cadiz, 794 F.Supp. 261, 267, aff'd, 4 F.3d 997 (7th Cir. 1993), and Quaker Alloy Casting v. Gulfco Indus., 123 F.R.D. 282, 288 (N.D.Ill.1988), reconsideration is not a tool for rehashing old arguments or raising new ones beyond initial pleadings.

Therefore, the motion to reconsider Judge Shadur’s dismissal of the Section 1667a(ll) disclosure claim is denied. As established in GM v. Orthmann and Early, 977 F.2d 369, new facts should not resurface unchanged arguments, thus supporting this conclusion.

The Kedzioras are provided a restricted opportunity to file a Third Amended Complaint, confined solely to the Section 1667a(ll) claim, within twenty-eight (28) days from the date of this order.

gold_text: Apparently, the Kedzioras believe that this Court is able to review the dismissal of a colleague’s order dismissing a claim in the same way the Court of Appeals reviewed the plaintiffs’ disclosure claims in Highsmith. The Kedzioras are mistaken. This case is before this Court in a wholly different posture. We are not directly reviewing Judge Shadur’s dismissal of the original complaint, although that order is eoncededly interlocutory, rather than a final judgment under Rule 54(b). Rather, we have been presented with a motion to reconsider rulings which did not address the Kedzioras’ new disclosure claims. Although the distinction may be academic, this Court does not believe that reconsideration of issues never presented nor ruled upon is proper under Rule 60(b) — or 59(e) for that matter. A motion to amend the Second Amended Complaint under Rule 15(a) is a better way to raise the new theory, and the Court of Appeals in this Circuit tends to allow amendments, even for new factual allegations raised for the first time on appeal, provided they are consistent with the complaint. Highsmith, 18 F.3d 434, 439 (citing Hrubec v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 981 F.2d 962, 963-64 (7th Cir.1992), and Dawson v. General Motors Corp., 977 F.2d 369, 372 (7th Cir.1992)). Although it appears that Judge Shadur denied a similar request by the Kedzioras when the Second Amended Complaint was filed, this Court believes that the claim asserted is so clearly cognizable under Highsmith, that it would be unjust to deny amendment, even at this late date.
