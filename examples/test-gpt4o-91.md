In addressing Hicks’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, we adhere to the principle that such fact-specific claims are generally not suitable for direct review. As established in United States v. Mala, fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance must first be presented to the trial court and cannot debut on direct appeal (7 F.3d 1058, 1063). This prudential rule insists on initial presentation at trial to ensure a developed record.

In this case, Hicks's claims of ineffective assistance are not adequately supported by the current record. The assertion that counsel’s performance was deficient hinges largely on Hicks's own observations and lacks concrete evidence of professional negligence or actual misconduct. The trial court's findings—that counsel had represented Hicks competently—along with the absence of clear-cut evidence to the contrary, indicate that Hicks’s claims fail to meet the threshold for direct review established in United States v. Segarra-Rivera, where direct appeal was allowed only in the presence of specific, colorable evidence of actual misconduct (473 F.3d 401, 385).

Given these considerations, Hicks’s ineffective assistance claims are best suited for collateral proceedings where a fuller factual record can be developed to assess the assertions of unpreparedness, conflict of interest, and coercion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's decisions on the matters amenable to direct review, while recognizing that the remaining ineffectiveness claims must be addressed in a different forum.

gold_text: ‘“We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.’ ” United States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401, 410 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993)). Hicks may choose to pursue his allegations that his counsel was conflicted and ineffective in a collateral proceeding. Regardless, on direct review, there is not enough to support his claims. The district court neither abused its discretion in denying counsel’s motion to withdraw, nor improperly participated in plea negotiations. Affirmed.
