E. Paralegal Fees

In addition to attorneys' fees, the EAJA allows for the recovery of fees for paralegals. In Jean, the Supreme Court recognized that legal assistants' fees could be included in the EAJA award as long as they are reasonable and consistent with prevailing market rates (Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154, 162, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 2320, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990)). Furthermore, the argument for reimbursing paralegal fees is supported by recognizing their contribution to reducing overall litigation costs by performing tasks at a lower rate than attorneys (Reference case 491 U.S. 274).

In this case, paralegal services were provided by Kramer Associates, and their contributions constituted substantial support to Dr. Waksberg’s legal team. Applying the prevailing market rates, this Court awards $90 per hour for 310 hours of paralegal work, resulting in an additional $27,900 for paralegal fees (Reference case 891 F.2d 323).

Therefore, the Court shall include this amount in the total award calculation.

gold_text: This Circuit has affirmed the award of paralegal fees under the EAJA. See Oklahoma Aerotronics, Inc. v. United States, 943 F.2d at 1352 (upholding award of paralegal time as “expenses”); Raton Gas Transmission Co. v. F.E.R.C., 891 F.2d 323, 329 n. 75 (D.C.Cir.1989) (approving of reasonable compensation for legal assistants such as paralegals). In analyzing another fee-shifting statute, the Supreme Court viewed it as “self-evident” that a statutory “ ‘reasonable attorney’s fee’ ... should compensate the work of paralegals.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274, 285, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 2470, 105 L.Ed.2d 229 (1989) (interpreting 42 U.S.C. § 1988). Whether the award under the EAJA is justified as a “reasonable attorney fee” or a necessary “project” expense, see § 2412(d)(2)(A), Dr. Waksberg shall be reimbursed for paralegal work in the amount of $19,923.90.
