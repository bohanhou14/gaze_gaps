Liu argues that the cumulative effects of his mistreatment, including the 24-hour detention and beating, amount to past persecution under our precedent. While the IJ emphasized the short duration of Liu's detention and the lack of medical documentation, we have recognized that the cumulative effect of multiple oppressive acts can compel a finding of persecution. For instance, in Niftaliev v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 504 F.3d 1211 (11th Cir. 2007), we found that numerous beatings, arrests, and interrogations culminating in a 15-day food-deprived detention constituted persecution (504 F.3d 1211). Similarly, in Ruiz v. Gonzales, 479 F.3d 762 (11th Cir. 2007), we acknowledged that repeated death threats and physical assaults collectively amounted to persecution (479 F.3d 762). Moreover, in Delgado v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 487 F.3d 855 (11th Cir. 2007), despite the inability to identify attackers, the cumulative threatening calls and incidents were sufficient for concluding past persecution (487 F.3d 855).

Liu's case bears resemblance to these precedents. Although Liu's detention was relatively short, the physical harm and ongoing requirement to report weekly to the police arguably create a cumulative oppressive situation. Therefore, considering the cumulative effect principle established in past cases, the record might compel a conclusion that Liu suffered past persecution. Hence, the BIA and IJ may have erred by not adequately considering the cumulative impact of the incidents Liu experienced.

gold_text: We recently have held, however, that oppressive acts can collectively or cumulatively amount to persecution. See De Santamaria v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 525 F.3d 999, 1008 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that record compelled a finding of persecution where petitioner’s life was repeatedly threatened over the course of two years, petitioner was yanked by her hair out of her vehicle, injuring her, and threatened with death if she continued her political activities, her family groundskeeper was tortured and killed for not revealing her whereabouts, and petitioner was beaten, kidnapped, and warned of her imminent murder); Delgado v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 487 F.3d 855, 859, 861-62 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that although individually the following incidents would not compel the conclusion that petitioners suffered past persecution, the “cumulative effects” of: (1) masked men pointing unloaded weapons at them and pulling the triggers; (2) the attack and severe beating of one of the petitioners; (3) continued threatening calls; and (4) the tampering with and vandalizing of one of their cars, compelled a finding of eligibility for withholding of removal).
