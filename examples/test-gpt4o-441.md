To prevail on a claim under § 523(a)(2)(A), the creditor must establish that the debtor made false representations with the intent to deceive and that the creditor relied on those representations to their detriment. The standard set forth in In re Roberts, 82 B.R. 179 (Bankr.D.Mass.1987) explains that the debtor's intent to deceive must be inferred from the totality of the circumstances. Moreover, false pretenses or representations must involve moral turpitude or intentional wrong, as highlighted in In re Turner, 23 B.R. 681 (Bankr.D.Mass.1982).

In the current proceeding, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made false representations in the Confidential Offering Memorandum and its Supplement. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim they relied on these falsifications, a reliance that, according to In re Jackson, 89 B.R. 308 (Bankr.D.Mass.1988), must be reasonable to support a nondischargeability claim. The Plaintiffs consumed the partnership units based on the representations that the proceeds would reduce BI's acquisition debt and that additional units would be sold.

Given the precedents and the circumstances as detailed in the complaint, Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that the Defendants acted with the requisite fraudulent intent and that the representations had a significant impact on their financial decisions. Therefore, the § 523(a)(2)(A) claims should not be dismissed as they connect directly to standards established in prior rulings, including 101 B.R. 822 and 89 B.R. 308.

gold_text: Defendants assert that this claim cannot be maintained because Plaintiffs did not allege that Debtors’ alleged fraud involved moral turpitude or intentional wrong. In re Snyder, 101 B.R. 822, 835 (Bankr.D.Mass.1989); In re Jackson, 89 B.R. 308, 312 (Bankr.D.Mass.1988). They allege that the fact that Plaintiffs did not plead that partnership funds were intentionally misappropriated or used for an illegitimate purpose is fatal.
