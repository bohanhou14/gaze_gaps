After reviewing the reference cases, it is clear that a debtor is not permitted to file a second bankruptcy case prior to the entry of discharge in an earlier proceeding. In Re Bodine, 113 B.R. 134 (Bankr.W.D.N.Y.1990) and In Re Kosenka, 104 B.R. 40 (Bankr.N.D.Ind.1989) established that a debtor cannot file a second bankruptcy case prior to the discharge of the first case. Furthermore, Bankruptcy Rule 1015 does not explicitly address the propriety of the same debtor filing two or more petitions under different chapters.

In the case of the Turners, they filed for Chapter 7 relief on August 26, 1996, and then withdrew their objection to Citizens' motion to lift the automatic stay. On November 14, 1996, they filed for Chapter 13 relief, which was received by the clerk's office on November 18, 1996. However, as In Re Hodurski, 156 B.R. 353, 354 (Bankr.D.Mass.1993) noted, a "simultaneous chapter 20" where a chapter 13 case is commenced during the pendency of a chapter 7 case is not permitted.

The Turners' argument that they could have received their discharge in their chapter 7 case prior to commencing their chapter 13 case is unlikely, as the notice provisions in the Bankruptcy Rules require a minimum of 80 days for a discharge to be issued. Moreover, the timing of the petitions suggests that a discharge was not issued prior to the commencement of the chapter 13 case. Therefore, the Turners' motion for a stay pending appeal is denied.

gold_text: There is a decided difference of opinion over whether a debtor may ever simultaneously maintain two separate bankruptcy proceedings. In re Jones, 117 B.R. 415, 421 (Bankr.N.D.Ind.1990). In the first line of cases, courts have read an old Supreme Court opinion to be a strict prohibition against ever having two cases open simultaneously. In re Heywood, 39 B.R. 910, 911 (Bankr.W.D.N.Y.1984) (citing Freshman v. Atkins, 269 U.S. 121, 46 S.Ct. 41, 70 L.Ed. 193 (1925)). The Heywood court premised its holding on the fact that a debtor possesses only one estate for the purpose of trusteeship and each bankruptcy must be administered as a single estate under a single chapter of the Bankruptcy Code. This continues to be the majority view. Norwalk Savings Society v. Peia (In re Peia), 204 B.R. 310, 314 (Bankr.D.Conn.1996). A minority view soon developed in some courts which declined to adopt a per se rule against such filings and permit a debtor to file a chapter 7, receive his or her discharge, and then file a second petition under chapter 13 to reorganize the debts which have not been discharged although certain administrative acts of the chapter 7 case such as the trustee’s filing of a final report have not already been completed. In re Hodurski, 156 B.R. 353 (Bankr.D.Mass.1993); In re Kosenka, 104 B.R. 40 (Bankr.N.D.Ind.1989); Frenz, 142 B.R. at 614 n. 2 (citing cases). While the majority view may be viewed as an absolutist position, the minority view does run the risk of making available “an easy avenue for abuse of the bankruptcy system” that would allow debtors to file multiple cases if they do not achieve their intended goal in a particular case. In re Bodine, 113 B.R. 134, 135 (Bankr.W.D.N.Y.1990).
