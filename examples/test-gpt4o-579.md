We find significant parallels between Bu’s case and established precedents validating asylum based on persecution due to political opinion. For instance, in Grava v. INS, 205 F.3d 1177, the central issue was whether the petitioner’s whistleblowing activities were tantamount to political opinion. The court highlighted that exposure and prosecution of government corruption inextricably intertwined with governmental operation is necessarily political. Similarly, Bu’s protest against endemic corruption in his government-owned factory parallels the circumstances presented in Grava.

Moreover, in Reyes-Guerrero v. INS, 192 F.3d 1241, the Ninth Circuit granted asylum for similar acts of opposing state corruption, affirming that expressing opposition to government malfeasance falls under protected political opinion. Like Reyes-Guerrero, Bu faced persecution for opposing corruption by powerful government officials.

In Marquez v. INS, 105 F.3d 374, the Seventh Circuit noted that hostility stemming from actions against government corruption could indeed form the basis for claiming political persecution, even if the persecution intertwined with personal motives. Bu’s situation aligns with Marquez, as his persecution emanated directly from his anti-corruption activities.

Lastly, in Desir v. Ilchert, 840 F.2d 723, it was held that even if a petitioner did not overtly express a political opinion, actions opposing corrupt government practices could lead to imputed political opinion, warranting asylum. Bu’s actions and the subsequent brutal reprisals by the authorities reflect the treatment discussed in Desir.

Given these precedents, it is clear that Bu’s organized protests and opposition to government corruption are deeply political acts, and the resulting persecution qualifies him for asylum. Thus, we remand this case for reconsideration consistent with these principles.

gold_text: In this case, the factual predicate for the petitioner’s asylum request is clear and uncontroverted. There is also no question that Bu has exhausted his claim that his protest of government corruption caused the persecution that he suffered. Moreover, case law supports Bu’s argument. The courts have held that whistleblowing against corrupt government officials may constitute political activity sufficient to form the basis of persecution “on account of political opinion,” as can the refusal to accede to government corruption. See, e.g., Grava v. INS, 205 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th Cir.2000) (“whistleblowing against one’s supervisors at work is not, as a matter of law, always an exercise of political opinion[,] ... [but] where the whistle blows against corrupt government officials, it may constitute political activity sufficient to form the basis of persecution on account political opinion” (citations omitted)); see also Reyes-Guerrero v. INS, 192 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.1999) (Colombian attorney who prosecuted corruption by members of the opposition party established “a causal connection between the persecution suffered by [him] and his political opinion”); Marquez v. INS, 105 F.3d 374, 381 (7th Cir.1997) (“political agitation against state corruption” can provide a basis for grant of asylum); Desir v. Ilchert, 840 F.2d 723, 727 (9th Cir.1988) (Haitian citizen who resisted extortion by the government’s semi-official security guards, the Ton Ton Macoutes, effectively “challenge[d] the underpinnings of the political system” and “bec[a]me an enemy of the government” despite his lack of overt expression of opinion).
