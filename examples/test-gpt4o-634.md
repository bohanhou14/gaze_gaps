Blakley's argument that the district court erred in dismissing her Lilly Ledbetter Act claim is unpersuasive. Although Blakley argues that this law was not available when she filed her EEOC charge, the district court has broad discretion to manage its docket and enforce procedural rules. The Ledbetter Act aims to address ongoing pay discrimination, not to revive previously dismissed claims without proper administrative exhaustion. Courts have consistently upheld that amendments to complaints should be allowed sparingly and with good cause (Reference Case: 210 F.3d 928, FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)). Moreover, given Blakley's conduct throughout the litigation, including untimely and improper filings, the court's decision aligns with ensuring judicial efficiency and fairness to the opposing party (Reference Case: 630 F.3d 1063, Zu,tz v. Nelson, 601 F.3d 842). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Blakley's Ledbetter Act claim.

gold_text: Although the district court “dismissed” her Ledbetter Act claim, Blakley’s argument may be viewed more appropriately as a challenge to the court’s denial of leave to amend her complaint to add a new claim. We review such denials for abuse of discretion. Wintermute v. Kan. Bankers Sur. Co., 630 F.3d 1063, 1067 (8th Cir.2011). Blakley was permitted to file an amended complaint only by the court’s January 20, 2010 order, which directed her to limit the scope of her complaint — not expand it. She never sought leave to add an entirely new claim. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2), Blakley could only add this claim with Schlumberger’s written consent or the court’s leave. She obtained neither. Moreover, adding a new claim would have required additional discovery by the parties and added further delays to the proceedings. Under the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to permit this new claim. See Popp Telcom v. Am. Sharecom, Inc., 210 F.3d 928, 943 (8th Cir.2000) (“Where an amendment would likely result in the burdens of additional discovery and delay to the proceedings, a court usually does not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend.”). Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of this claim, which Blakley attempted to add without permission from Schlumberger or leave from the court.
