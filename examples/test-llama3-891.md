In the context of legal cases, it is crucial to consider the scope of governmental liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). Reference case 473 U.S. 52, United States v. Shearer, emphasizes that the government's liability results from the assumption of a duty to perform non-negligently, and not from the mere fact that it was an employer. In this case, the government's duty of protective care arose out of its special relationship with Mrs. Bembenista, and it would be liable even if she had been assaulted by a private person unconnected with the government.

On the other hand, reference case 553 F.2d 8, United States v. Schwarz, highlights the importance of assigning a case to a different judge to minimize even the suspicion of partiality. However, in this case, reassigning the trial to a different judge is not necessary.

In conclusion, the government's liability under the FTCA is not barred by the assault and battery exception, and the district court did not err in dismissing the appellants' claim of medical malpractice. The Bembenistas' failure to properly present their malpractice claim to the Army resulted in the dismissal of the claim. The Court's decision in Sheridan v. United States, 108 S.Ct. 2449, 101 L.Ed.2d 352 (1988), emphasizes the importance of considering the government's assumption of a duty to perform non-negligently, rather than its mere employment status.

gold_text: Appellants seek remand to a district judge other than Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, under 28 U.S.C. § 2106. Applying United States v. Robin, 553 F.2d 8, 10 (2d Cir.1977), we find that there is no reason to transfer the case to a different judge on remand. Judge Jackson has shown no bias toward appellants, nor is there any indication that he would have difficulty in applying our holding today in light of his previously expressed views. In dismissing the Bembenistas’ claims, Judge Jackson relied on United States v. Shearer, 473 U.S. 52, 105 S.Ct. 3039, 87 L.Ed.2d 38 (1985), the most recent Supreme Court treatment of the assault and battery exception at that time, and his ruling was superseded six months later by Sheridan v. United States, — U.S.-, 108 S.Ct. 2449, 101 L.Ed.2d 352 (1988). We also find no reason to transfer the remand on the basis of Judge Jackson’s analysis of section 2675(a), with which we agree. Furthermore, the disputed issues in this case will not remain on remand: this court has ruled that the assault and battery exception does not bar a suit for breach of the duty of protective care and that appellants did not adequately “present” their administrative claims. Judge Jackson has not prejudged, nor even examined, the remaining issues to be decided in this case.
