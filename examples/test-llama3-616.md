The cases provided highlight the importance of scrutinizing the business activities of an employer to determine whether they are engaged in commerce or production of goods for commerce, thereby triggering the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) coverage.

In the case of Reference case 328 U.S. 108, the court held that a maintenance employee working for a building corporation that furnishes loft space to tenants can hardly be engaged in the production of goods for commerce unless an adequate proportion of the tenants of that building are so engaged. The court asked whether the tenants of the building were producing goods for interstate commerce and found that they were.

Similarly, in Reference case 372 F.2d 143, the court considered whether a defendant, Centralized Services, Inc., was engaged in commerce or production of goods for commerce. The court found that the defendant's employees were engaged in the production of goods for commerce, as they prepared tax returns for customers who mailed them to the Internal Revenue Service in Chamblee, Georgia.

In both cases, the courts emphasized the importance of considering the business activities of the employer and the employees to determine whether they are engaged in commerce or production of goods for commerce. The courts also highlighted the need to construe the FLSA provisions in a forthright but not liberal manner.

In conclusion, these cases demonstrate the importance of carefully analyzing the business activities of an employer and its employees to determine whether they are engaged in commerce or production of goods for commerce, and thereby triggering the FLSA coverage. The courts' decisions in these cases provide guidance on how to interpret the FLSA provisions and how to apply them to specific business scenarios.
