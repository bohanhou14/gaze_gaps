**Generation:**

Moreover, in line with the ruling in *Reference case 770 F.2d 308*, the plaintiff's complaint suffers from a lack of proper causation. As in *B.F. Hirsch* and *Haroco*, there is a necessity to show a proximate causal connection between the alleged wrongdoing and the purported damages to establish a valid claim under state law as well as RICO. Here, plaintiff's failure to precisely link their alleged injuries to the defendant's racketeering activities renders the claim insufficient.

Similarly, *Reference case 747 F.2d 384* underscores that for a valid civil RICO claim under section 1962(c), the plaintiff must clearly demonstrate that the alleged enterprise engaged in interstate or foreign commerce and that the injury was "by reason of" the violation. Plaintiff's amended complaint does not convincingly allege such injuries or show that the enterprise conducted by the defendant meets the statutory requirements.

As a result, these deficiencies prompt the dismissal of the RICO claim and associated state law claims due to inadequacies in establishing causation, enterprise involvement, and a direct nexus between the predicate acts and alleged injuries per the contours delineated in these reference cases.

Thus, plaintiff's complaint is dismissed.

gold_text: For purposes of violations of § 1962(c), plaintiff has also failed to state a civil RICO claim even if the complaint is read to allege that defendant himself is the enterprise. It is well established in this Circuit that with respect to § 1962(c) — as opposed to § 1962(a) — the enterprise and the defendant cannot be the same person or entity. See Bennett v. United States Trust Co. of New York, 770 F.2d 308, 315 (2d Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1058, 106 S.Ct. 800, 88 L.Ed.2d 776 (1986); see also Haroco, Inc. v. American National Bank & Trust Company of Chicago, 747 F.2d 384, 399-403 (7th Cir.1984).
