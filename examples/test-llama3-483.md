Defendant's motion for sanctions is denied. In the case of Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 204 (1990), the Supreme Court established that a court cannot award sanctions solely because of a party's failure to prevail on a motion for summary judgment. The court must consider the totality of the circumstances, including the parties' conduct and the legal sufficiency of the claims. In this case, the court finds that plaintiff's claims were not frivolous, and the defendant's decision to move for sanctions was premature.

In the case of Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962), the Supreme Court held that the decision to award sanctions is committed to the discretion of the trial court. The court must consider the totality of the circumstances, including the parties' conduct and the legal sufficiency of the claims. In this case, the court finds that the defendant's decision to move for sanctions was not supported by the evidence, and the court will not award sanctions.

In the case of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, the court is authorized to impose sanctions on a party who signs a pleading or motion that is not well grounded in fact or law. In this case, the court finds that plaintiff's claims were not frivolous, and the defendant's decision to move for sanctions was not supported by the evidence.

In the case of 812 F.2d 393, the court held that a party who files a frivolous motion for summary judgment may be subject to sanctions. However, in this case, the court finds that the plaintiff's claims were not frivolous, and the defendant's decision to move for sanctions was not supported by the evidence.

In the case of 908 F.2d 336, the court held that a party who files a frivolous motion for summary judgment may be subject to sanctions. However, in this case, the court finds that the plaintiff's claims were not frivolous, and the defendant's decision to move for sanctions was not supported by the evidence.

Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion for sanctions.

gold_text: 28 U.S.C. § 1927. Sanctions are called for by § 1927 when an attorney unreasonably and vexatiously multiplies the proceedings. The standard to be applied in such a case is somewhat unclear. See O’Connell v. Champion Intern. Corp., 812 F.2d 393, 395 n. 2 (8th Cir.1987) (“We do not hold that § 1927 contains only an objective standard, as opposed to both an objective and subjective standard. The words of the statute require unreasonable and vexatious conduct.... Whether this requires a finding of bad faith in addition to unreasonable conduct is a question not before us.”). At least one Eighth Circuit panel, however, has indicated that the language of § 1927 requires both a finding of objectively unreasonable behavior and a finding of bad faith. N.A.A.C.P.—Special Contribution Fund v. Atkins, 908 F.2d 336, 340 (8th Cir.1990). See also, Joseph V. Edeskuty & Associates v. Jacksonville Kraft Paper Co., Inc., 702 F.Supp. 741, 746 (D.Minn.1988) (denying sanctions pursuant to § 1927 because “[t]he record does not reflect bad faith on the part of ... counsel[.]”).
