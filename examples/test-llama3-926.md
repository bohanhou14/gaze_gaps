STALEY, Circuit Judge.

This appeal is from a decision of the district court regarding a maritime lien for repairs performed on the Steamship Brigadier General Absolom Baird. The vessel, built in 1919, was over 690 gross tons, 161 feet in length, 32 feet beam, with a draft of about 13 feet. The services for which the lien is sought were furnished at two separate times, the first in the spring and summer of 1950, and the second in the spring of 1951.

The district court decided that the vessel was not a "dead ship" and thus, there was admiralty jurisdiction. We agree with this decision, citing North Pacific Steamship Co. v. Hall Bros. Co., 249 U.S. 119, 39 S.Ct. 221, 63 L.Ed. 510 (1919), and New Bedford Dry Dock Co. v. Purdy, 258 U.S. 96, 42 S.Ct. 243, 66 L.Ed. 482 (1922).

The claimant argues that libellant acquired no maritime lien for the 1950 work because Ellison, who ordered the services, was without authority to pledge the credit of the vessel. However, citing Dampskibsselskabet Dannebrog v. Signal Oil & Gas Co., 310 U.S. 268, 60 S.Ct. 937, 84 L.Ed. 1197 (1940), we hold that libellant is entitled to a maritime lien for the 1950 services.

Regarding the 1951 work, the claimant argues that the mortgage recorded on March 16, 1951, denies authority to bind the vessel. However, citing Morse Drydock & Repair Co. v. Steamship Northern Star, 271 U.S. 552, 46 S.Ct. 589, 70 L.Ed. 1082 (1926), we hold that the mortgage does not take preference over the lien.

The judgment of the district court will be reversed and the cause remanded for the entry of judgment consistent herewith.
