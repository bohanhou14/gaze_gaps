The court must determine whether the statute of limitations has been tolled due to fraudulent concealment. In Ciccarelli v. Carey Can. Mines, Ltd., 757 F.2d 548 (3d Cir.1985), the court held that fraudulent concealment tolls the statute of limitations where "through fraud or concealment the defendant causes the plaintiff to relax his vigilance or deviate from the right of inquiry." The court must consider whether Defendant's actions, including the issuance of the notice of policy lapse and the subsequent termination of the policy, constituted fraudulent concealment.

In this case, Defendant's actions may have caused Mr. Bariski to relax his vigilance or deviate from the right of inquiry. Defendant's notice of policy lapse may have led Mr. Bariski to believe that the policy had lapsed due to his failure to make timely payments, rather than due to Defendant's alleged failure to receive his premium payment. Furthermore, Defendant's subsequent termination of the policy may have further misled Mr. Bariski, causing him to believe that the policy was properly terminated.

In Gee v. Kean, 471 F.Supp. 619 (E.D.Pa.1979), the court held that "reliance upon the word of one physician when there is a duty to disclose and a patient is not informed of the risk of injury" may constitute fraudulent concealment. Similarly, in this case, Defendant's failure to disclose the true nature of the policy's termination may have constituted fraudulent concealment.

In conclusion, the court finds that a material issue of fact exists as to whether Defendant's actions constituted fraudulent concealment and whether the statute of limitations has been tolled. Therefore, the court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the bad faith claim.

gold_text: The doctrine of fraudulent concealment serves to toll the statute of limitation where a defendant “causes the plaintiff to relax vigilance or deviate from the right of inquiry” concerning the cause of an injury. Mest v. Cabot Corp., 449 F.3d 502, 516 (3d Cir.2006) (quoting Ciccarelli v. Carey Canadian Mines, Ltd., 757 F.2d 548, 556 (3d Cir.1985)). For example, a physician’s statement which “lull[s] a patient into a false sense of security” can in certain circumstances constitute fraudulent concealment. Bohus v. Beloff, 950 F.2d 919, 926 (3d Cir.1991) (citations omitted) (finding fraudulent concealment where a physician told his patient that her post-surgery pain was a normal part of the healing process). Plaintiff bears the burden of proving the applicability of the doctrine by “clear, precise, and convincing evidence.” Fine, 870 A.2d at 860 (citing Molineux v. Reed, 516 Pa. 398, 532 A.2d 792, 794 (1987)). The doctrine of fraudulent concealment only applies where the defendant has deceived the plaintiff, intentionally or unintentionally, such that the plaintiff is unaware of the injury and its cause. Fine, 870 A.2d at 860-61; see also Mest, 449 F.3d at 517 (requiring plaintiff to demonstrate an act of concealment on the part of the defendant that “would divert or mislead the plaintiff from discovering the injury”).
