The appellant contends that there was no basis in fact for his denial of a I-O classification and argues that misclassification is a complete defense to Count III. This argument was neither raised nor addressed during the trial or in post-trial motions, making it a novel issue on appeal. As established in *United States ex rel. Huizinga v. Commanding Officer, 446 F.2d 124 (8th Cir. 1971)*, appellate courts typically do not rule on issues not presented in the trial court.

Notably, in reference case 395 U.S. 185, the Supreme Court held that a registrant's challenge to their classification is a valid defense to prosecution for refusal to submit to induction, but it’s not a defense in a prosecution for failing to report for a pre-induction physical. Appellant’s reliance on the improper I-O classification theory is thus misplaced.

Moreover, referencing 423 F.2d 757, Zmuda's contention that invalid classification defenses are inapplicable to physical examination noncompliance prosecutions reiterates that the registrant's classification should not impact their duty to undergo a physical examination. Thus, the appellant's claim of misclassification fails to serve as a legitimate defense in this context. The district court correctly focused on the appellant's defiant actions, which explicitly disturbed the examination process, further justifying the procedural omission during his physical examination.

gold_text: An equally cogent reason for rejection of appellant’s thesis flows from the rule that an improper classification is no defense to a prosecution for refusing to submit to the pre-induction physical examination. Appellant relies upon 32 CFR § 1660.20 which provides in effect that persons classified 1-0 who refuse to submit to the physical are to be expeditiously ordered to alternative service rather than being prosecuted. Here, however, appellant had not been classified 1-0 but occupied a I-A classification at the time he was ordered to report for the physical. Appellant’s reliance upon 32 CFR § 1660.20 must therefore rest upon the premise that registrants erroneously classified by the Selective Service System need not obey interim orders to which they could not be subjected if they had been placed in a classification which exempted them from induction into service. Inasmuch as appellant was I-A, 32 CFR § 1628.10 is applicable. It provides that before a registrant can be ordered to report for induction, or ordered to perform civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety or interest, he must receive an Armed Forces physical examination. In a situation somewhat analogous to our case, the Supreme Court ruled that a registrant is under a duty to comply with the order to report for a physical examination, citing 32 CFR §§ 1628.10 and 1628.-11, and that he may be criminally prosecuted for failure to comply. And finally the court stated, “[a]n invalid classification, if allowed to be raised, would have been a complete defense to that prosecution (failing to report for induction) ; it would not be a defense today to a prosecution for failure to report for a pre-induction examination.” McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. 185, 203, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 1667, 23 L.Ed.2d 194 (1969). United States v. Zmuda, 423 F.2d 757 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied 398 U.S. 960, 90 S.Ct. 2176, 26 L.Ed.2d 545 (1970), stands squarely for the proposition that a registrant who claims he was improperly classified must nevertheless report for a physical examination and is subject to prosecution if he fails to do so. Thus, assuming arguendo, that appellant had been erroneously denied a 1-0 classification, he was nevertheless required to submit to the physical.
