Although Point Vail asserts that the removal was proper due to the alleged fraudulent joinder of Point Shipping, the court finds this argument unconvincing. As the courts have consistently held, a removal petition must be joined by all defendants unless an exception, such as fraudulent joinder, applies. In Bradford v. Harding, 284 F.2d 307, 309 (2d Cir. 1960), the court emphasized that "all the defendants must join in seeking removal," or the petition is defective. This principle was also supported by subsequent cases, including the interpretation of § 1441(a) (676 F.2d 270).

Moreover, the record does not support Point Vail's contention that Point Shipping has been fraudulently joined. For fraudulent joinder to be applicable, it must be clear that no relief is sought against the joined defendant, thus permitting realignment of the parties to satisfy the rule of unanimous consent (644 F.2d 1310). In the present case, the arbitrator awarded damages against both Point Vail and Point Shipping, thus negating the possibility of fraudulent joinder.

Given the absence of any substantiated claim of fraudulent joinder and the necessity for unanimity in the removal petition, the motion for remand must be granted. The Union’s request for fees under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1447(c) and 1927 is denied due to insufficient evidence of improper conduct by Point Vail.

So ordered.
