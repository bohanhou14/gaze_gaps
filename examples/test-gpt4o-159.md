In addressing the mootness argument presented by the appellants, it is important to emphasize that this case fits within the doctrine of “capable-of-repetition, yet evading review.” As illustrated in reference case 416 U.S. 115, ongoing issues like those surrounding inmate transfers based on union activities are not purely speculative but are alive and integral to Newkirk’s present rights. This doctrine was similarly recognized in Southern Pac. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm’n, 219 U.S. 498, 514-516, and reinforces that the nature of these disputes necessitates judicial intervention for immediate and direct injuries. 

Furthermore, the flexibility in continuing or reviving proceedings, as acknowledged in reference case 273 U.S. 135, aligns with our decision. The potential for future similar occurrences further substantiates the necessity of a court's power to render judgments to ensure principles of due process are upheld through their mutable stages.

In light of these precedents and the court's findings, there is a clear mandate to affirm due process protections, allowing inmates at least rudimentary hearings to minimize arbitrary and capricious decisions. The circumstances echo Southern Pac.’s provision that the prevailing issues hold substantive grounds for review, meriting sustained judicial oversight (219 U.S., at 515). Thus, the appellate's argument lacks merit when weighed against these foundational principles.

gold_text: We find no merit in appellants’ additional argument that Newkirk’s action should have been dismissed as moot prior to the decision on the merits since prior thereto he had been returned from Clinton to Wallkill. Even after his return he remained subject to a new transfer at any time based on mere rumor or surmise which he had no opportunity to answer or refute. In light of the state’s continued insistence on its policy of not providing the inmate with any opportunity to respond to information against him, the likelihood of such a transfer was concrete rather than remote, speculative, or contingent. See Super Tire Engineering Co. v. McCorkle, 416 U.S. 115, 94 S.Ct. 1694, 40 L.Ed.2d 1, 42 U.S.L.W. 4507 (1974); Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941); McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 181-182, 47 S.Ct. 319, 71 L.Ed. 580 (1927). See generally Diamond, Federal Jurisdiction to Decide Moot Cases, 94 U.Pa.L.Rev. 125, 137-47 (1945). Furthermore, notwithstanding the Superintendent’s good faith assurances in support of appellants’ motion for dismissal that there would be no adverse effects from the transfer as far as consideration for parole was concerned, we think that Newkirk was entitled to a judicial decree to that effect.
