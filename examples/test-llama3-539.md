The case at hand involves a dispute between Air et Chaleur, a Belgian corporation, and Eliot Janeway, a financier and economic consultant, over a contract to repurchase Medserco stock. The plaintiffs claimed that Janeway breached the contract by refusing to purchase their stock at $6 per share, despite his earlier promise to do so.

In reviewing the case, we must consider the court's decision to direct a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on the issue of damages. Janeway argues that the court erred in this decision, claiming that the plaintiffs were obligated to mitigate damages by securing a replacement put after the breach. However, the court ruled that the burden was on the defendant to prove the scope of the possible mitigation and that defendant failed to introduce evidence sufficient to carry this burden.

Furthermore, Janeway argues that the court erred in denying his motion to reopen the proof to allow for evidence on the question of replacement puts. However, the court's decision to deny this motion was not an abuse of discretion, as defense counsel was on notice that mitigation and damages were a part of the case, and the replacement put theory was not an unreasonable possibility.

In conclusion, the court's decision to direct a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on the issue of damages was proper, as the burden was on the defendant to prove the scope of the possible mitigation, and defendant failed to introduce evidence sufficient to carry this burden. Additionally, the court's decision to deny the motion to reopen the proof was not an abuse of discretion, as defense counsel was on notice that mitigation and damages were a part of the case.

gold_text: Janeway’s final argument is that the district court erred in allowing plaintiff Cauchie to invoke the Fifth Amendment in response to questions asked on cross-examination concerning his alleged non-payment of Belgian income taxes and in refusing to allow defense counsel to comment on Cauchie’s failure to testify. Here again, our scope of review is narrow. Limitations on the extent of cross-examination are left to the discretion of the trial judge. Lewis v. Baker, 526 F.2d 470, 475 (2d Cir. 1975). We are concerned only with whether the trial judge abused his discretion in controlling the cross-examination of Cauchie. Id. Only if the alleged error was prejudicial may we find it an adequate basis for reversal. United States v. Singh, 628 F.2d 758, 763 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1034, 101 S.Ct. 609, 66 L.Ed.2d 496 (1980). Cf. Dunbar v. Harris, 612 F.2d 690, 692-93 (2d Cir.1979).
