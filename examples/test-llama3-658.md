In the case of Peyton Realty Company (102 F.2d 959), the court had jurisdiction to enter the final decree without reserving jurisdiction for future proceedings. The court's decision was based on the reservation contained in the order confirming the plan of reorganization, which reserved jurisdiction for the purpose of adjusting disputes relative to the ownership of first mortgage bonds and the issuance of new securities.

In contrast, the case of Reference case 125 F.2d 327, the court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the petition after the entry of the final decree, as the relief sought was foreign to the matter over which the court expressly reserved jurisdiction. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petition had no relation to the consummation of the plan, the transfer of assets, or the enforcement of the plan's provisions.

In the instant case, the court had jurisdiction to reopen the decree of January 23, 1942, and permit the exchange of securities. The court's decision was based on Section 204 of the Chandler Act, which provides that the court may fix a time limit within which holders of securities shall present or surrender their securities.

However, the court's decision to vacate the decree of January 23, 1942, was an abuse of discretion. The court's decision was based on the principle that a bankruptcy proceeding is a continuous suit, and that the court has jurisdiction to reopen any matter which has been litigated in the case. However, in this case, the application was not to reopen any matter which had been litigated in the case, but rather to change the status and permit the exchange of securities.

In conclusion, the court's decision to vacate the decree of January 23, 1942, was an abuse of discretion, and the court should not have jurisdiction to reopen the decree. The court's decision was based on the wrong principle, and the relief sought was foreign to the matter over which the court had jurisdiction.

gold_text: In In re Sherland Bldg. Corporation, D. C., 29 F.Supp. 985, the court held, in an attempt by the petitioner to have a final decree vacated and permission granted to exchange his securities, a situation similar to the instant case, that no reservation having been made in the final order, it was a final determination and the jurisdiction of the court ended at that time. To like effect are In re Tom Moore Distillery Co., D. C., 52 F.Supp. 938; In re Corona Radio & Television Corporation, 7 Cir., 102 F.2d 959; In re Wedgewood Hotel Co., 7 Cir., 125 F.2d 327.
