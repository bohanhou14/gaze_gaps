The case presented involves a challenge to the constitutionality of Louisiana's "B-girl" statute, which prohibits the employment of females, commonly known as B-girls, to solicit patrons for drinks and accept drinks from patrons in exchange for remuneration. The plaintiffs, Daniel Umphlet and four of his employees, argue that the statute violates their equal protection, due process, and first amendment rights.

The district court dismissed the complaint on summary judgment, and the plaintiffs appealed. The court of appeals held that the statute did not violate the equal protection clause, citing DeFrances v. Edwards, 609 F.2d 239 (5th Cir.1980). The court also held that the statute was not vague or overbroad, citing Tyler v. United States, 796 F.2d 94 (5th Cir.1986), and Washington v. Watkins, 655 F.2d 1346 (5th Cir.1981).

The court noted that the statute was enacted to address the problems associated with B-drinking, including the employment of B-girls, which was a serious problem in Louisiana at the time. The court also noted that the statute treated men and women identically, prohibiting both from employing or permitting B-girls to solicit drinks.

The court rejected the plaintiffs' arguments that the statute was vague or overbroad, citing Tyler v. United States and Washington v. Watkins. The court held that the statute clearly defined the prohibited conduct and did not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.

In conclusion, the court held that the B-girl statute did not violate the equal protection clause or the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court also held that the statute was not vague or overbroad.
