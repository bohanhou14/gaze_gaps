In evaluating the case of William Bertie Handley v. City of Hope, it is essential to consider the relevance of notable case precedents such as Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, which fundamentally addressed racial segregation and its broader implications on public services. However, the primary focus here shifts towards the legal distinction between governmental and proprietary functions, fundamental in discerning municipal immunity.

Parallel legal reasoning is present in Briggs v. Elliott, 349 U.S. 294, reinforcing that during systemic transitions, courts retain jurisdiction. This emphasizes judicial oversight in ensuring adherence to non-discriminatory practices. While these cases primarily dealt with education, their principles on public accountability and inherent duties resonate in the administration of municipal facilities like the swimming pool in Hope, Arkansas.

The plaintiff's claims, although framed within the spectrum of contractual obligations, essentially hinge upon tort principles. The analogy drawn from Brown and Briggs underscores that even under evolving judicial determinations, municipalities maintain certain immunities when operating within governmental capacities, especially when no profit motive is demonstrably present.

Consequently, the court finds no substantial basis for holding the City of Hope liable under the circumstances, aligning with the immunity extended in analogous cases. The motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendant is thereby sustained.

Plaintiff relies upon the case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873, as implemented in 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083.
