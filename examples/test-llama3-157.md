The indemnity clauses in the Standard Form for Detour Agreement, as seen in case 350 F.2d 273, provide that the Foreign Company (Rock Island) shall hold the Home Company (Burlington) harmless for all liabilities or claims arising from the detouring of trains. This clause is similar to the one discussed in case 266 F.2d 857, where the court held that the indemnity provision was not void as against public policy, despite the railroad's wanton conduct.

In case 205 F.2d 589, the court ruled that a contract releasing a railroad from liability was not void as against public policy, notwithstanding a statute imposing absolute liability. Similarly, in case 296 F.2d 256, the court held that a contract indemnifying a railroad against liability for its own negligence was not void as against public policy.

In this case, the district court correctly construed the indemnity provisions of the Detour Agreement to apply to the circumstances of this wreck. The Agreement provides that the Foreign Company shall assume the risks of injury to others and hold the Home Company harmless for any loss or damage caused by the detouring of trains. This is similar to the language used in case 261 F.2d 939, where the court held that the indemnity provision was not limited to losses caused by the in-demnitee's negligence.

The language of the Agreement is broad and manifests the parties' intent to require indemnification by the Foreign Company regardless of the proximate cause of the accident or legal theory upon which liability might be grounded. This is in line with the principles discussed in case 414 F.2d 192, where the court held that "strict" construction of indemnity contracts purporting to relieve the indemnitee of its own negligence is a matter of degree and emphasis.

In conclusion, the indemnity clauses in the Standard Form for Detour Agreement are similar to those discussed in the reference cases and are not void as against public policy. The district court correctly construed the Agreement to apply to the circumstances of this wreck and the indemnity provisions are broad enough to cover losses resulting from the Home Company's violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.
