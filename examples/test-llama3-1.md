In examining the case, we find that the Social Security Administration's determination that no disability existed on the last day of coverage, June 30, 1966, is not supported by the evidence. Reference case 514 F.2d 561 highlights the importance of considering all applicable regulations and overlooking significant factors that may impact the correct adjudication of a claim. In this case, the administrative law judge's preoccupation with the claimant's earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider critical evidence and overlook significant factors that would have bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim.

Furthermore, reference case 527 F.2d 224 emphasizes the need to correct clerical errors or errors on the face of the evidence when reopening a claim. In this case, the claimant's testimony and medical records provide adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record and support the reopening of the claim.

We conclude that the claimant's description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing, and the evidence submitted by physicians familiar with her condition supports her claim. The administrative law judge's opinion misses the mark, and we find that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period.

Therefore, we remand the case to the Secretary for consideration of the claimant's request to reopen because of error on the record. We also note that the claimant's request to reopen the 1968 claim is timely, and we will consider this request in conjunction with the Secretary's decision on the reopened claim.

gold_text: 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8) provides that a final decision may be reopened at any time “for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.” As the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said in Lauritzen v. Wein-berger, 514 F.2d 561, 563 (8th Cir. 1975), the question for the Social Security Administration on any claim for reopening is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, or whether there is manifest error in the record. This inquiry, in opting for a flexible approach to the doctrine of res judicata, supports the view expressed by this court in Coulter v. Weinberger, 527 F.2d 224, 228 (3d Cir. 1975):
