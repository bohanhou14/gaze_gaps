Based on the provided reference cases, it is clear that the court will look beyond the label of the obligation and examine the substance of the agreement to determine whether it is a property settlement or a support obligation. In the case of 381 F.2d 168, the court held that the intention of the parties to treat the payments as alimony was not determinative, but rather the court looked to the substance of the situation to determine the true nature of the obligation.

Similarly, in the case of 8 B.R. 428, the court held that the bankruptcy court need not accept the label of the decree and can look beyond the mere recitations of the settlement agreement to determine whether the obligation is in fact imposed for the support of the spouse and children.

In the current case, the parties entered into a property settlement agreement that provided for the Debtor to pay the expenses of the former marital home, including mortgage payments, taxes, and utility bills, as well as car payments. The agreement did not provide for any alimony payments, and the Defendant did not ask for any alimony. The court must examine the substance of the agreement to determine whether the obligations are in fact imposed for the support of the spouse and children.

Based on the evidence presented, it appears that the Defendant is capable of supporting herself and does not rely solely on the Debtor for support. She has her own income and owns the car, and the children are within walking distance of school. Therefore, it is likely that the court will determine that the obligations are not in fact imposed for the support of the spouse and children, but rather are a property settlement.

In conclusion, based on the reference cases and the evidence presented, it appears that the obligations imposed by the property settlement agreement are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. The court will likely determine that the obligations are a property settlement rather than a support obligation, and therefore will not be discharged in bankruptcy. <answer>

citations: ['381 F.2d 168', '8 B.R. 428']

gold_text: The provision of the Code excepting from the overall protective provision of the general discharge obligation for alimony, maintenance or support of a wife or children continues the historical approach which always afforded to spouses or children some form of protection against future adversities which they face when the family unit is destroyed. The public policy behind this approach is clear and is based on the proposition that the former spouse rather than society should be responsible for the maintenance and support of members of the family unit which is destroyed through divorce. Factors which may be considered to characterize payments provided for in a divorce decree for purposes of determining dischargeability include whether the obligation terminates on the death or remarriage of the recipient or donor spouse, Adler v. Nicholas, 381 F.2d 168 (5th Cir. 1967); whether the payment appears to balance disparate incomes, In re Walder, 2 BCD 1205 (W.D.Wise.1976), In re Massimini, 8 B.R. 428 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Penn.1981); whether the obligation is payable in installments over a substantial period of time, In re Smith, 436 F.Supp. 469 (N.D.Ga.1977) and whether there are children who must be supported, In re Woods, 3 BCD 750 (7th Cir. 1977).
