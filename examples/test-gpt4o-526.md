**Generation:**

Kennedy has not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that his termination was based on age discrimination. The comments made by Banbury, though inappropriate, do not rise to the level of proving discriminatory intent under the ADEA. Moreover, an isolated typographical error and remark do not substantiate Kennedy’s claim. As noted in the case of 983 F.2d 509, merely suggestive or equivocal remarks are insufficient to prove a hostile working environment or causation for termination. Furthermore, the employer’s decision-making process, as outlined, was based on documented performance issues, which Kennedy himself acknowledged. Additionally, in line with the principles set forth in 490 U.S. 228, multiple documented reasons for recommending Kennedy’s termination demonstrate a consistent rationale that is not overshadowed by any alleged discriminatory bias.

Therefore, following the legal standards and precedents, Kennedy has failed to meet his burden of proof for both gender and age discrimination claims. Summary judgment in favor of Danavox is warranted as Kennedy has not established any genuine issue of material fact regarding his termination.

For the reasons stated, defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted.

gold_text: Kennedy also asserts he has direct evidence of discrimination. As noted, Kennedy relies on a typographical error (“Glenn [Kennedy] still copulating”) and the corresponding statement repeated at a sales meeting that “You [Kennedy] would have a difficult time copulating at your age,” as well as statements by Banbury in October 1993, to Kennedy that, “you dress well for an old guy” and “fortunately, I’m not as old as you.” There is no evidence that Banbury played any part in the decision to terminate Kennedy. Thus, his remarks do not support Kennedy’s claim of discrimination. See Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen, 983 F.2d 509, 545 (3d Cir.1992) (stray remarks of nondecisionmakers should be given little weight), (citing Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 277, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 1804-OS, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (O’Connor, J. concurring)). Kennedy attributes one remark to Ormsby, which she denies making. Assuming she made the statement, Kennedy acknowledges that the circumstances surrounding the “copulating” statement were considered humorous by everyone, including Kennedy. Kennedy Depo., pg. 10. This is hardly evidence of a discriminatory animus based on Kennedy’s protected status. Kennedy has failed to demonstrate that his termination occurred under circumstances which give rise to an inference of age discrimination. Thus, the court grants the motion of Danavox for summary judgment on this claim under the ADEA and the MHRA.
