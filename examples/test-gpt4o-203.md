The policy considerations underlying the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) emphasize its hybrid nature, drawing from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the Civil Rights Act. Relevant case law supports the necessity of compliance with mandated procedural prerequisites. In Powell v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. (494 F.2d 485), the court underscored that the 180-day notice requirement is jurisdictional, reinforcing the necessity for timely filing of notice with the Secretary of Labor, a conclusion echoed in Hiscott v. General Elec. Co. (521 F.2d 632) and Cochran v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Co. (376 F.Supp. 302).

Additionally, in Ott v. Midland-Ross Corp. (523 F.2d 1367), the court reiterated that failing to timely file a notice of intent to sue within the 180-day federal period results in a lack of jurisdiction. Furthermore, as discussed in the context of the ADEA’s legislative history and intent to harmonize with state procedures (515 F.2d 1195), adherence to state limitations periods serves to preserve the federal right without imposing undue hardship on claimants unaware of shorter state deadlines. Therefore, the plaintiff's timely filing within the 180-day federal period, despite missing the state deadline, is sufficient to maintain the action.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

gold_text: . Current case law has only dealt with § 626(d) as jurisdictional. (Hiscott, supra; Powell v. Southwestern Bell, 494 F.2d 485 (5 Cir. 1974); Edwards v. Kaiser Aluminum, 515 F.2d 1195 (5th Cir. 1975)). In addition, there has been some tendency to isolate § 626(d) as containing the jurisdictional prerequisites. (See Ott v. Midland Ross Corp., 523 F.2d 1367 (6th Cir. 1975) (holding that while § 626(d) is jurisdictional, § 626(e) is not)).
