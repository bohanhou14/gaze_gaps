OPINION

The petitioner, Zainab Ali, seeks reversal of the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) order denying her application for asylum and protection under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The BIA held that Ali was firmly resettled in Denmark and, therefore, ineligible for asylum.

The regulation defining firm resettlement requires that an alien has entered into another nation with, or while in that nation received, an offer of permanent resident status, citizenship, or some other type of permanent resettlement. 8 C.F.R. § 208.15 (2000). In Yang v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 79 F.3d 932 (9th Cir.1996), the court held that an alien will not be found to be firmly resettled in a third country if it is shown that his physical presence in the United States is a consequence of his flight in search of refuge. 79 F.3d at 939.

In this case, Ali was granted refugee status in Denmark and received a Danish passport and residence permit. She remained in Denmark for over ten years with refugee status. Therefore, the BIA's determination that Ali was firmly resettled in Denmark is supported by the regulation and the case of Yang v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 79 F.3d 932 (9th Cir.1996).

Furthermore, Ali's claim under the Convention against Torture is also denied. The regulation defines torture as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person. 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1) (2000). In Farbakhsh v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 20 F.3d 877 (9th Cir.1994), the court held that the term "acquiescence" requires that the public official, prior to the activity constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity. 20 F.3d at 881.

In this case, the Danish police did not breach its legal responsibility to intervene to prevent the torture inflicted upon Ali. Therefore, the BIA's determination that the Danish police did not acquiesce to the torture is supported by the regulation and the case of Farbakhsh v. Immigration and Naturalization Service,

Another country may have allowed only a temporary and not a permanent refuge. But where the duration and circumstances indicate that the asylum seeker may remain in the third country, then it is incumbent upon him to show the contrary.”); cf. Farbakhsh v.
