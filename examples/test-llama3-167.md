Appellant Petito's contention that he was denied due process because he was not informed of the possibility of a criminal contempt charge when he refused to testify after being granted immunity is without merit. As noted in LUMBARD, Circuit Judge, in Case 529 F.2d 770, "One who defies the public authority and willfully refuses his obedience, does so at his peril." Similarly, in CARD AMONE, Circuit Judge, in Case 491 F.2d 1156, it was held that a contemptuous defendant need not be warned, nor even be aware, that his conduct could be visited with a criminal sanction.

In this case, Petito was granted immunity and still refused to testify before the grand jury. He was subsequently held in custody for twenty-seven days and charged with criminal contempt for his refusal to obey the court's order. Petito's argument that he was misled by the district court's statement that he would be held in custody until he agreed to answer questions is unfounded. As stated in Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 371, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 1536, 16 L.Ed.2d 622, 627-28 (1966), the power to impose coercive imprisonment in a civil contempt proceeding is limited by the individual's ability to comply with the court's order. When the grand jury is discharged, confinement for civil contempt must terminate because the possibility of compliance has ended.

In conclusion, Petito's claims of procedural error and lack of notice are without merit. The district court's actions were proper, and Petito's conviction for criminal contempt is affirmed.

gold_text: On appeal we noted that the determination of facial validity at an in camera examination was sufficient to require an individual to answer grand jury questions. Morales, 566 F.2d at 406; In re Millow, 529 F.2d 770, 773 (2d Cir. 1976); In re Persico, 491 F.2d 1156 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 924, 95 S.Ct. 199, 42 L.Ed.2d 158 (1974). We held that there was no right to a suppression hearing since the criminal contempt proceeding, although occurring after the grand jury had disbanded, was so intimately connected with that grand jury as to be a “part of those proceedings.” Morales, 566 F.2d at 408. Thus, in the instant case appellant did not have the right to discovery of the wiretap order and its supporting papers, or to a suppression hearing on the propriety of its issuance.
