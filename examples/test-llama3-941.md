In the present case, the Howes seek to litigate their lender liability claims against Premier and Vaughan, which were not addressed in their earlier Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The courts below dismissed the claims, holding that they were barred by res judicata.

The transactional test, as explained in Nilsen v. City of Moss Point, requires that the two actions be based on the same nucleus of operative facts. In this case, the loan transaction at the heart of the present litigation was also the source of Premier's claim against the estate. The Howes vigorously contested the validity of Premier's lien in adversary proceedings in the bankruptcy court and contended that Premier's loan was usurious. Under the circumstances, the Howes not only had the opportunity to bring the present claims against Premier but the obligation to do so.

The courts below also held that the Howes' claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata, citing Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U.S. 351 (1876). In this case, the Supreme Court held that a judgment rendered by a district court has the effect of a judgment rendered by a state court, and any attempt to relitigate the matter is barred.

Furthermore, the Howes sought to dismiss their Chapter 11 proceedings and proceed under Chapter 12, citing 11 U.S.C. § 1112(b). However, the bankruptcy court and district court denied their motion, holding that dismissal of a Chapter 11 proceeding based on a mere desire to proceed under Chapter 12 is a de facto conversion prohibited by 11 U.S.C. § 302(c)(1).

In conclusion, based on the foregoing reasons, the courts below correctly dismissed the Howes' lender liability claims, holding that they were barred by res judicata and the doctrine of res judicata. The Howes' attempt to dismiss their Chapter 11 proceedings and proceed under Chapter 12 was also denied, as it was deemed a de facto conversion prohibited by 11 U.S.C. § 302(c)(1).
