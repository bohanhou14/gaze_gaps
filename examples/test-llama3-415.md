In the case of Zarnow v. City of Wichita Falls, 500 F.3d 401 (5th Cir.2007), the court held that a municipality can be liable for a constitutional violation if it is alleged to have caused the violation through a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by the governing body's officers. Additionally, the court stated that a municipality can also be liable if the constitutional deprivation is pursuant to a governmental custom, even if such custom has not received formal approval. In this case, Zarnow alleged that the City's policy on the use of the "plain view" doctrine was unconstitutional and that the City was responsible for the officers' misuse of the doctrine.

To prove municipal liability, Zarnow must show that the City had a policy or custom that was the moving force behind the alleged constitutional violation. In this case, Zarnow argued that the City's policy on the use of the "plain view" doctrine was the moving force behind the violation. However, the court found that Zarnow had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support this claim.

In another case, Jackson v. City of Borger, 780 F.2d 1158 (5th Cir.1985), the court held that a municipality can be liable for a constitutional violation if it is alleged to have caused the violation through a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by the governing body's officers. The court also stated that a municipality can also be liable if the constitutional deprivation is pursuant to a governmental custom, even if such custom has not received formal approval.

In conclusion, to prove municipal liability, Zarnow must show that the City had a policy or custom that was the moving force behind the alleged constitutional violation. However, the court found that Zarnow had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. The court stated that a municipality can be liable for a constitutional violation if it is alleged to have caused the violation through a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by the governing body's officers, or if the constitutional deprivation is pursuant to a governmental custom, even if such custom has not received formal approval.
