However, other circuits have disagreed with our approach. In **Penn, LLC v. Prosper Business Dev. Corp., 773 F.3d 764, 768 (6th Cir. 2014)**, the Sixth Circuit clarified that eight circuits reject the substantial compliance theory. Similarly, in **Cadle Co. v. Pratt (In re Pratt), 524 F.3d 580** and **Nisenbaum v. Milwaukee County, 333 F.3d 804, 808 (7th Cir. 2003)**, the Seventh Circuit's reliance on substantial compliance has been questioned for its insufficient analysis of Rule 11’s text and Advisory Committee Notes, making its persuasiveness dubious.

Furthermore, **Mulhern v. Aunt Mid’s 466 F.3d 1179** underscores the importance of strict compliance with Rule 11’s procedural requisites to mitigate chilling effects and formalize procedural due process considerations. The Eleventh Circuit in **Ridder v. City of Springfield, 109 F.3d 288 (6th Cir.1997)** emphasized that failing to comply with the safe-harbor provision precludes sanctions.

In this context, PNC Bank’s letter did not meet the procedural requirement of Rule 11(c)(2). The district court’s reliance on our case law regarding substantial compliance was misplaced, given the wider circuit disagreement and the clear textual commands of Rule 11. Thus, the district court’s sanctions against Riffner were procedurally defective, warranting our reversal.

III. Conclusion
Strict compliance with Rule 11 is non-negotiable. The absence of a served motion correction opportunity renders the sanctions procedurally improper. Therefore, we reverse the district court’s order imposing sanctions.

**Judgment Reversed.**

gold_text: There are both legal and factual problems with this theory- of “substantial compliance” to save the sanctions order in this case. The legal problem is that the substantial compliance theory we adopted in Nisenbaum stands alone and is difficult to reconcile with the explicit requirements of the Rule and the clear explanation from the Advisory Committee. No other circuit has adopted this approach. See Penn, LLC v. Prosper Business Dev. Corp., 773 F.3d 764, 767-68 (6th Cir. 2014) (reviewing circuit split; Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have rejected “substantial compliance,” and only Seventh .Circuit has adopted it). Our colleagues in other circuits have been highly critical of the terse treatment of the issue in Nisenbaum. E.g., Cadle Co. v. Pratt (In re Pratt), 524 F.3d 580, 587-88 (5th Cir. 2008) CNisenbaum did not address language of Rule 11, Advisory Committee notes, or other Rule 11 jurisprudence); Roth v. Green, 466 F.3d 1179, 1193 (10th Cir. 2006) (same). As the Ninth Circuit explained in Barber v. Miller, “warnings were not motions” and “the Rule requires service of a motion.” 146 F.3d 707, 710 (9th Cir. 1998). The 1993 amendment “deliberately imposed” the requirement of service. Id. “It would therefore wrench both the language and purpose of the amendment to the Rule to permit an informal warning to substitute for service of a motion.” Id.
