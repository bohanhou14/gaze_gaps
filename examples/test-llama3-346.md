The case at hand concerns the scope of judicial immunity afforded to a judge who engaged in irregular conduct. The judge, Vanderwater, arrested the plaintiff, Flor Lopez, and caused him to be charged with petty theft, convicted him, and sentenced him to 240 days in jail (620 F.2d 1229). The district court granted summary judgment for Vanderwater on the ground of judicial immunity, which was reversed by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The court held that Vanderwater committed non-judicial acts under color of state law that proximately resulted in violations of Lopez's constitutional rights.

In a similar case, the court in 742 F.2d 262 held that judicial immunity does not bar prospective injunctive relief against a judicial officer. The court also noted that judicial immunity does not bar an award of attorney's fees against a judicial officer.

In the instant case, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Magistrate James G. Carr, engaged in misconduct in the case of Sharp v. Owens Coming Fiberglass, C80-450, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division. The plaintiff claims that the Magistrate issued disqualification and gag orders without holding an evidentiary hearing, and that these acts were non-judicial in nature. However, the court in Stump v. Sparkman (435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331) held that the issuance of gag orders and rulings on counsel's continued representation of a client are both prerogatives of a judge.

The court also notes that the Magistrate's acts were indeed "judicial" in nature since the issuance of gag orders and rulings on counsel's continued representation of a client are both prerogatives of a judge. The court further holds that a judicial officer is not required to hold a hearing prior to issuing a gag order, as gag orders fall within the Court's prerogative to maintain appropriate decorum in the administration of justice and protect the rights of the litigants from prejudice.

In conclusion, the court finds that the defendant Magistrate James G. Carr did not commit non-judicial acts under color of state law that proximately resulted in violations of the plaintiff's constitutional rights. The court also finds that the defendant's acts were indeed "judicial" in nature, and that a judicial officer is not required to hold

gold_text: Citing the case of Lopez v. Vanderwater, 620 F.2d 1229 (7th Cir.1980), plaintiff analogizes defendant’s conduct to the exercise of “prosecutorial powers.” Response at 6-7. The test enunciated in Sevier v. Turner, 742 F.2d 262, 272 (6th Cir.1984), is “whether initiating accusatory processes such as criminal prosecutions or civil contempt proceedings is a function normally performed by a judicial officer.” (Citing Stump, 435 U.S. at 362, 98 S.Ct. at 1107.) Plaintiff complains that in his orders of July 17 and July 18, 1984, “the Magistrate called upon the defendant’s law firm to conduct an investigation into the legal and personal activities of attorney Affeldt____” Response at 7. An examination of the orders, attached as exhibits to plaintiff's Response, does not show the Magistrate ordering any investigation. Rather, what appears is the Magistrate grappling with defendant’s motion to disqualify Affeldt. The Magistrate states that “it appears that certain readily ascertainable facts are in dispute, and that those facts may have some pertinence to the resolution in question.” July 19, 1984 Order at 1. The Magistrate asks defendant to supplement the record in support of this motion. Id. at 2. Such requests to supplement the record are made to assist the Court in rendering an informed decision; such requests are not in the nature of orders for independent investigations.
