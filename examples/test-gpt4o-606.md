In considering White's petition for habeas corpus relief, the court must determine the adequacy and effectiveness of § 2255 as a remedy. The precedent in reference case 430 U.S. 372 clarifies that a collateral remedy substitution does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus provided the new remedy remains adequate and effective. Furthermore, it establishes that the habeas corpus remedy remains open if § 2255 is shown to be inadequate or ineffective.

In White's situation, he has not demonstrated that § 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. As indicated in reference case 226 F.3d 328, § 2255 is not considered inadequate or ineffective merely because an individual cannot obtain relief under that provision. White has failed to provide evidence of any change in substantive law rendering his convicted conduct non-criminal, a crucial requirement under the Jones test. Consequently, White does not satisfy the criteria necessary to invoke the savings clause and proceed under § 2241.

Despite his reliance on Poole v. Dotson, White has not shown that events after his initial § 2255 motion render § 2255 an inadequate or ineffective remedy. Unlike Poole, who faced new circumstances affecting his conviction, White's claims do not meet the rigorous standards required to bypass § 2255's exclusive post-conviction framework.

Therefore, without the necessary showing that § 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, White's § 2241 petition is improperly filed and must be dismissed.

It is therefore ORDERED that White’s § 2241 petition is summarily DISMISSED without prejudice.

AND IT IS SO ORDERED.

gold_text: A petition under § 2241 is available for a federal prisoner to collaterally attack his sentence, however, when a motion under § 2255 is “inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.” § 2255; see also Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372, 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977). Petitioner has previously filed a § 2255 petition which was denied. C/A 2:03-379- PMD. The Fourth Circuit has unequivocally held that “ § 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because an individual is unable to obtain relief under that provision. A contrary rule would effectively nullify the gatekeeping provisions.” In re Jones, 226 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2000) (citations omitted). It is likely that this Petition is filed outside of the one-year statute of limitations on § 2255 petitions. However, “[sjection 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because the sentencing court does not grant relief, the one-year statute of limitations has expired, or the petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of the amended § 2255.” Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, 290 F.3d 536, 539 (3rd Cir.2002). Rather, “[a] § 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective only where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a § 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim. It is the inefficacy of the remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative.” Id. at 538.
