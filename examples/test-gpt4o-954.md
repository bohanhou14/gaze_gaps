**Generation:**

In the matter before the court, the primary contention is whether the debtors' desire to dismiss their Chapter 7 petition on the grounds of potential adverse outcomes regarding their assets constitutes sufficient cause. Drawing parallels to **Reference case 15 B.R. 655**, the court finds that the ability to pay debts or the realization of asset equity, as argued by the debtors, does not necessitate a case dismissal when creditors might be prejudiced. As in Williams' case, the intention to improve debt payments or preserve assets for unsecured creditors is insufficient to warrant dismissal.

Furthermore, in line with **Reference case 3 B.R. 167**, debtors do not possess an absolute right to voluntarily dismiss their petitions post-filing. The court emphasized that a debtor's petition once filed must be scrutinized to avoid granting preferential treatment to select creditors, potentially prejudicing others. The debtors' motion to dismiss, premised on the avoidance of the trustee’s actions against an automobile asset, does not demonstrate just cause. This echoes the conclusion that preferring specific creditors over the collective interests in the bankruptcy estate cannot justify dismissal.

Accordingly, the court finds that the debtors’ stated reasons—potential litigation costs and the desire to protect a preferential lien held by the debtor’s father—do not meet the threshold for voluntary dismissal under 11 U.S.C. § 707(a). The debtor's failure to predict asset liquidation impacts does not provide sufficient grounds for case dismissal. On these grounds, the trustee's objection to the debtors' exemption claim is sustained, and the motion to dismiss the Chapter 7 case is denied.

S.D.Ohio 1980) If anything, it is grounds for retaining jurisdiction, i.e., that creditors who perhaps expected to recover nothing on their claims may be assured of an equitable and full distribution of the debtor’s newly discovered assets.
