**Generation:**

In determining the validity of the remaining patent claim, consideration must be given to the principles outlined in the reference cases. In **Timely Prods. Corp. v. Arron**, 523 F.2d 288, the court emphasized the importance of evaluating obviousness by considering the scope and content of prior art, as well as the differences between the prior art and the patent claims in question. The court found the entire Costanzo patent invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 103 due to obviousness in light of the prior art. Similarly, the analysis of the Rexford patent involves a rigorous assessment of the prior art, particularly the three-armed lever disclosed in the Burridge patent, which serves a similar function.

Moreover, in **Co. v. Bonnie Blend Chocolate Corp.**, 172 F.2d 150, the court took into consideration the actions of the parties in determining unfair competition and the impact on market competition. Here, allegations of unfair competition by Marx against Buddy L were dismissed based on the lack of evidence that Buddy L acted in bad faith or had knowledge of any misconduct by the Japanese manufacturer.

Consistent with these precedents, the Court concludes that the Rexford patent's claim of non-obviousness is untenable given the prior art. Therefore, claim 15 of the Rexford patent is invalid, and Marx's complaint is dismissed in its entirety. Additionally, considering the statutory guidance and the prevailing jurisprudence, the Court finds no basis to award attorneys' fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 in this case.

gold_text: . Plaintiffs primary challenge to the Court’s earlier disposition is on the unfair competition claim. See note 3 supra. Post trial, plaintiff became “aware of several court decisions,” changed its theory and argued that Buddy L had appropriated Marx’s trade secrets and was liable therefor for unjust enrichment whether or not it had knowledge, relying primarily upon Conmar Prods. Corp. v. Universal Slide Fastener, 172 F.2d 150 (2d Cir. 1949), and Koehring Co. v. National Automatic Tool Co., 257 F.Supp. 282 (S.D.Ind.1966), aff’d, 385 F.2d 414 (7th Cir. 1967) (per curiam), both cases involving trade secrets. Aside from plaintiff’s total failure to introduce any evidence whatsoever concerning the existence of any trade secrets in connection with the Marxwriter parts, neither case supports the plaintiffs position. Koehring was decided under Indiana law and involved that defendant’s hiring of plaintiffs former employees. In Conmar, concerning a fact situation similar to that in Koehring, the Court permitted recovery only for the defendant’s use of plaintiff’s trade secrets for the period after he learned of the employee’s breach of the secrecy agreement with plaintiff. Thus, even in Conmar, knowledge is essential, and as indicated in note 3 supra, plaintiff did not prove knowledge. Finally, any recovery under a Con-mar theory would be cut off as of the time that plaintiff offered the product embodying the trade secret for public sale. See Timely Prods. Corp. v. Arron, 523 F.2d 288, 304 (2d Cir. 1975); Conmar, supra, 172 F.2d at 155-56.
