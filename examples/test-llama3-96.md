The court must deny the motion for intervention as a matter of right under Rule 24(a)(2) of the Rules of the United States Claims Court (RUSCC). The proposed intervenors, the Timbisha Shoshones, the Duckwater Shoshones, and the Yomba Shoshones, have failed to show that their interests are not adequately represented by the Te-Moak Bands of Western Shoshone Indians. As stated in Peterson v. United States, "interests may be different without being adverse." 408 F.2d 175.

The proposed intervenors' delay in filing their motion is unacceptable. They have known of their right to intervene for over twenty-one years, and their delay is not justified by any unusual circumstances. The court must weigh the prejudice to the existing parties against the prejudice to the proposed intervenors and find that the former outweighs the latter. As stated in Ackley v. United States, "the length of time during which the would-be intervenor actually knew or reasonably should have known of his right to intervene...; [and] the existence of unusual circumstances militating either for or against a determination that the application is timely." 385 F.2d 694.

The proposed intervenors' argument that their rights were impaired because the Te-Moak Bands improperly handled their case is also without merit. As stated in Stadin v. Union Elec. Co., "mere difference of opinion among attorneys is not in itself inadequate representation within the meaning of the Rule [24(a)(2)]." 309 F.2d 912.

In conclusion, the court denies the motion for intervention as a matter of right under Rule 24(a)(2) of the RUSCC because the proposed intervenors have failed to show that their interests are not adequately represented by the Te-Moak Bands and have also failed to show that their rights were impaired by the Te-Moak Bands' handling of their case. The proposed intervenors' delay in filing their motion and their failure to show unusual circumstances militating in favor of their motion also weigh against their request for intervention. <answer>

gold_text: The rules governing motions for intervention require that intervenors must be represented adequately, and, in so doing, encompass the intervenors’ due process rights. Indeed, the requirements and standards under RUSCC 24(a)(2) are “primarily an interest test and a practical guide to disposing of lawsuits by involving as many apparently concerned persons as is compatible with efficiency and due process.” Smuck v. Hobson, 408 F.2d 175, 179 (D.C. Cir.1969) (en banc); Nuesse v. Camp, 385 F.2d 694, 700 (D.C.Cir.1967). For reasons stated above, the court has determined that the proposed intervenors are adequately represented by the Te-Moak Bands and, accordingly, the requirements of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment have been met.
