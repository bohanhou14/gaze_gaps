In this case, the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the issue of probable cause. The court relied on the fact that a warrant was secured for the arrest and searches. However, the court did not consider the reliability of the informant's tip and the lack of corroborating evidence. This is in contrast to the Supreme Court's holding in Leon v. Peterson, 475 U.S. 335 (1986), that a warrant is not automatically sufficient to establish probable cause and that a court must consider the reliability of the informant's tip and the lack of corroborating evidence.

The court also failed to consider the Fourth Amendment's requirement that a search must be reasonable and that probable cause must be established before a search can be conducted. As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Leon, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), a search without a warrant is per se unreasonable unless it falls within one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. In this case, there was no warrant exception, and the search was not conducted with a warrant. Therefore, the search was unreasonable and in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Additionally, the court failed to consider the exclusionary rule, which is a fundamental principle of the Fourth Amendment. As the court held in Brown v. Illinois, 774 F.2d 716 (7th Cir. 1985), evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded from evidence at trial. In this case, the evidence obtained during the search was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and must be excluded.

Furthermore, the court failed to consider the doctrine of qualified immunity, which is a defense available to government officials. As the court held in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 738 F.2d 538 (9th Cir. 1984), government officials are entitled to qualified immunity if their actions are reasonable and in good faith. In this case, the officers' actions were not reasonable and in good faith, and they are not entitled to qualified immunity.

In conclusion, the district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendants was error. The court failed to consider the reliability of the informant's tip, the lack of corroborating evidence, the Fourth Amendment's requirement of reasonableness, the exclusionary rule, and the doctrine of qualified immunity. This case must be remanded for further proceedings.

gold_text: Police officers are entitled to rely on a judicially secured warrant for immunity from a ยง 1983 action for illegal search and seizure unless the warrant is so lacking in indicia of probable cause, that official belief in the existence of probable cause is unreasonable. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1098, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986). Thus, an officer cannot rely on a judicial determination of probable cause if that officer knowingly makes false statements and omissions to the judge such that but for these falsities the judge would not have issued the warrant. See Donta v. Hooper, 774 F.2d 716, 718-19 (6th Cir.1985); U.S. v. Mankani, 738 F.2d 538, 545 (2nd Cir.1984) (citing Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 165, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2681, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978)).
