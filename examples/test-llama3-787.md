In the context of the case presented, the question of whether the obligation of the guarantors should be reduced by the same amount as the debtor's obligation due to the commercially unreasonable sale of the collateral by the Small Business Administration (SBA) is a crucial one. The SBA's sale of the collateral was found to be commercially unreasonable, leading to a rebuttable presumption that the value of the collateral is at least equal to the amount of the outstanding debt, as held in Kobuk Eng., Etc. v. Superior Tank & Const, 568 P.2d 1007 (1977).

Here, the SBA's sale of the Archdomes' equipment resulted in a sale price of only $12,043, despite the equipment being valued at $162,734 at the time of repossession. This commercially unreasonable sale led to a deficiency of $348,435, which was sought to be collected from the guarantors. However, the court found that the guarantors' obligation should also be reduced by the same amount as the debtor's obligation, citing the holding in Fruehauf Trailer Co. of Canada, Ltd. v. Chandler, 67 Wash.2d 704, 409 P.2d 651 (1966), which allowed guarantors to waive certain defenses.

This holding is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Yazell, 382 U.S. 341 (1966), which held that federal law should not override state law in the interpretation and enforcement of SBA loans, unless there is a sufficient federal interest. In this case, the SBA's commercially unreasonable sale of the collateral has resulted in a deficiency that is not representative of the true value of the collateral, and thus, the guarantors' obligation should be reduced by the same amount as the debtor's obligation.

Therefore, in light of the SBA's commercially unreasonable sale of the Archdomes' equipment and the holding in Kobuk Eng., Etc. v. Superior Tank & Const, it is clear that the obligation of the guarantors should be reduced by the same amount as the debtor's obligation. This reduction will date back to February 1, 1974, and will also take into account the $5,000 value of the demonstration model located near the Pasco warehouse, as well as the $199,831 recovery from the sale of the Data Pathing, Inc.
