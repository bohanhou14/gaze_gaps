In the case of Evans v. Levitt, 515 F.3d 778, the court dismissed Lott's defamation claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The court held that the allegedly defamatory statement was reasonably susceptible to an innocent interpretation, and therefore, Lott's claim was barred by the innocent construction rule. This rule is based on Illinois law and requires that a court consider all reasonable interpretations of the allegedly defamatory statement before determining whether it is defamatory. As stated in Tuite v. Corbitt, 224 Ill.2d 490, 310 Ill.Dec. 303, 866 N.E.2d 114, 121 (2006), "any reasonable, innocent interpretation sounds the death knell to a per se defamation claim."

In this case, the court found that the allegedly defamatory statement could be reasonably interpreted as a critique of Lott's theory, rather than an accusation of falsifying data. The court also noted that Levitt's statement did not directly attack Lott's character, but rather addressed his ideas and theories. This distinction is important because, as stated in Dilworth v. Dudley, 75 F.3d 307, 310 (7th Cir.1996), "the remedy for this kind of academic dispute is the publication of a rebuttal, not an award of damages."

Regarding Lott's pro quod defamation claim, the court held that he had waived his right to raise this claim by not including it in his original complaint. Additionally, the court denied Lott's request to file an amended complaint that added a pro quod claim, finding that it was untimely and futile.

In conclusion, the court's decision in Evans v. Levitt is consistent with Illinois law and the innocent construction rule. The court's analysis is also supported by the language of the allegedly defamatory statement and the context in which it was made. As stated in Buechele v. St. Mary's Hosp., 156 Ill.App.3d 637, 109 Ill.Dec. 83, 509 N.E.2d 744, 745-46 (Ill.App.Ct.1987), "the statute of limitations on defamation actions is one year from the date of publication."

gold_text: Both these arguments fail for the same reason — Lott neglected to allege any special damages in both his original complaint and his proposed amended complaint. In Illinois courts and federal courts sitting in diversity, special damages must be specifically stated in a pro quod claim. Fed.R.CivJP. 9(g); Muzikowski v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 322 F.3d 918, 927 (7th Cir.2003); Action Repair, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., 776 F.2d 143, 149-50 (7th Cir.1985); Schaffer v. Zekman, 196 Ill.App.3d 727, 143 Ill.Dec. 916, 554 N.E.2d 988, 992 (1990). In his original complaint, which made no explicit pro quod claim, Lott alleged only “substantial reputational and monetary damages,” without a specific accounting of those damages or an explanation of how the purported defamation caused them. While the proposed amended complaint explicitly tacked on a claim for pro quod defamation, its allegations of damages are equally vague. Lott added allegations that he encountered people in job interviews and at academic seminars who understood the passage to be a swipe at his professional reputation but does not describe what pecuniary losses he suffered as a result. Lott doesn’t even say what came of the job interviews where the book was mentioned. Such general allegations, which make no effort to explain how any reputational damage translated into actual harm, are not enough. Muzikowski, 322 F.3d at 927; Action Repair, Inc., 776 F.2d at 149-50, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Jacobson, 713 F.2d 262, 269-70 (7th Cir.1983). Thus, we see no error in the district court’s dismissal of the defamation claim or its refusal to accept the futile amended complaint. Johnson v. Dossey, 515 F.3d 778, 780 (7th Cir.2008).
