The cases, 36 F.3d 272 and 49 F.3d 895, provide guidance on the application of the Sentencing Guidelines, specifically the obstruction of justice enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.

In the case of 36 F.3d 272, the court held that an enhancement under § 3C1.1 is not appropriate unless the obstruction was "willful." The court defined willfulness as requiring a specific intent to obstruct justice. The court also noted that certain conduct, such as intentionally failing to appear at a judicial proceeding, is inherently obstructive of the administration of justice and does not require a specific intent to obstruct.

In the case of 49 F.3d 895, the court addressed the issue of whether a defendant's failure to report to pretrial services and subsequently failing to appear at a preliminary examination was willful obstruction of justice. The court held that the defendant's failure to appear was willful because she had the specific intent to avoid the preliminary examination.

In the case at hand, the defendant failed to report to pretrial services and subsequently failed to appear at a preliminary examination. The court enhanced the defendant's offense level by two levels, finding that she willfully obstructed the administration of justice. The court's finding was based on the defendant's specific intent to avoid the preliminary examination, which is consistent with the holdings in 36 F.3d 272 and 49 F.3d 895.

In conclusion, the Sentencing Guidelines provide for an enhancement of two levels if a defendant willfully obstructs the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense. The cases, 36 F.3d 272 and 49 F.3d 895, provide guidance on the application of this enhancement. In the case at hand, the court properly enhanced the defendant's offense level based on her willful obstruction of justice. <answer>

gold_text: An adjustment under § 3C1.1 “is appropriate only upon a finding that the defendant had the ‘specific intent to obstruct justice, i.e., that the defendant consciously acted with the purpose of obstructing justice.’” United States v. Defeo, 36 F.3d 272, 276 (2d Cir.1994) (citation omitted). However, we have held that “[cjertain conduct ... such as intentionally failing to appear as required at judicial proceedings, is so inherently obstructive of the administration of justice that it is sufficient that the defendant willfully engaged in the underlying conduct, regardless of his specific purpose.” United States v. Reed, 49 F.3d 895, 900 (2d Cir.1995). For instance, in Defeo, we held that “[f]light from pretrial services between conviction and sentencing warrants an obstruction enhancement.” 36 F.3d at 276.
