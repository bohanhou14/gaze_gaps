The case at hand is a complex one, involving the termination of a dealership agreement between Hollister Incorporated and Bruce Medical Supply. The court found that Hollister's decision to terminate the agreement was the result of a conspiracy between Hollister and other authorized dealers to boycott Bruce Medical Supply due to its discount pricing. However, the evidence presented suggests that Hollister's decision was based on reasonable concerns about international diversion of its products, rather than a conspiracy to boycott Bruce Medical Supply.

In reference case 521 F.2d 1230, the court held that a manufacturer's decision to terminate a dealership agreement due to the dealership's price-cutting activities was not violative of the Sherman Act, as long as the manufacturer had a legitimate business reason for doing so. Similarly, in reference case 433 U.S. 36, the court held that a manufacturer's decision to terminate a dealership agreement due to the dealership's failure to comply with the manufacturer's marketing policies was not violative of the Sherman Act.

In this case, Hollister had a legitimate concern about international diversion of its products, and its decision to terminate the dealership agreement with Bruce Medical Supply was based on this concern, rather than a conspiracy to boycott Bruce Medical Supply. The court's finding of a conspiracy was based on a flawed analysis of the evidence, and the decision to terminate the dealership agreement was reasonable and not violative of the Sherman Act.

Therefore, we must reverse the judgment of the district court and hold that Hollister's decision to terminate the dealership agreement with Bruce Medical Supply was not violative of the Sherman Act. The court's finding of a conspiracy was based on a flawed analysis of the evidence, and the decision to terminate the dealership agreement was reasonable and supported by the record. <answer>

gold_text: Bruce contends, very possibly correctly, that by March, 1981, defendant was undertaking to prevent its getting any Hollister products whatever, and asserts this to be an overbroad response. There are two answers to this. One is that Bruce does not suggest how defendant could safely protect itself by doing anything less. While foreign ostomates generally prefer closed pouches, we find nothing in the record to suggest that they use nothing else. It would appear that virtually any box of Hollister products sent to Bruce could, potentially, wind up overseas. Even if not, defendant was not required to adopt the least restrictive means of stopping Bruce from selling abroad, but merely means reasonably suited to that purpose. American Motor Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 3 Cir., 1975, 521 F.2d 1230, 1248-50; see Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 1977, 433 U.S. 36, 58 n.29, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 2561 n.29, 53 L.Ed.2d 568. Defendant cannot be faulted for failing to engage in elaborate and possible time-consuming speculation about Bruceâ€™s marketing intentions on an order-by-order or box-by-box basis. The court having held, quite properly, that defendant was to be held to nothing stricter than a rule of reason, Continental T. V, Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., ante; Eastern Scientific Co. v. Wild Heerbrugg Instruments, Inc., 1 Cir., 1978, 572 F.2d 883, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 833, 99 S.Ct. 112, 58 L.Ed.2d 128, we see no basis for finding that it violated that standard.
