In the context of bankruptcy law, the automatic stay is a powerful tool that can be used to prevent creditors from taking action against debtors. However, the automatic stay can be lifted or modified by a court order, as seen in cases such as 851 F.2d 81 and 93 B.R. 859. In these cases, the courts have emphasized the importance of considering the equities between the debtor and the creditor when determining whether to reinstate the automatic stay.

In general, to reinstate the automatic stay, a debtor must demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm to the movant, harm to the movant outweighing harm to the nonmovant, and that injunctive relief would not violate public interest. As seen in 851 F.2d 81, the court may also consider the timeliness of the request for relief and the manner in which relief from the automatic stay was granted.

In the case of 93 B.R. 859, the court emphasized the importance of considering the feasibility of the debtor's plan and the potential for the plan to adequately protect the creditor. The court also noted that the automatic stay can be reinstated only when all of the equities are in the proper constellation.

In conclusion, the automatic stay can be reinstated in bankruptcy cases, but it requires a careful consideration of the equities between the debtor and the creditor. The courts will typically consider the likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm to the movant, harm to the movant outweighing harm to the nonmovant, and public interest, as well as the timeliness of the request for relief and the feasibility of the debtor's plan.

gold_text: We therefore conclude that the Debtor cannot possibly prevail in the main thrust of this action. We note that, secondarily, the Debtor avers that the Defendant is violating the automatic stay by retaining the check. We reject this claim for two reasons. First, the disposition of this check appears to be within the scope of matters “in reference to” the Premises, concerning which we granted relief on September 8, 1989, and which result we decline to alter here. Secondly, the Defendant is merely serving as custodian of a check which is worthless unless and until both drawees agree to negotiate it. Whether the check is in the possession of the Defendant or the Debtor or some third party is of no great significance. A trivial or technical violation of the stay is not actionable. See Brown v. Pennsylvania State Employees Credit Union, 851 F.2d 81, 84-85 (3d Cir.1988). A refusal to turn over the proceeds of a disputed claim to a debtor is not a violation of the automatic stay, but merely creates a potential post-petition obligation of the holder of the property to the debtor. See In re TM Carlton House Partners, Ltd., 93 B.R. 859, 870 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1988).
