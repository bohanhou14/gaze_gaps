**Generation:**

We note that the argument of ratification by Chief Coughlin hinges on the concept that a policymaker's endorsement of subordinates' actions can establish municipal liability. However, precedent dictates that a policymaker's affirmative defense of an officer's actions does not necessarily indicate a policy of unconstitutional behavior. In 780 F.2d 1158, the court held that Sheriff Ledbetter’s phrase, "I'd rather be tried by twelve than carried by six," was insufficient to establish encouragement of excessive force, particularly as his conduct did not explicitly and contextually support a policy of unlawful behavior. Similarly, in 588 F.3d 838, the necessity to demonstrate a pattern "so common and well-settled as to constitute a custom" was emphasized, and isolated incidents without a demonstrated pervasive pattern were insufficient to establish municipal liability.

Applying this reasoning, Zarnow’s assertion that the defense made by the City and Chief Coughlin constitutes ratification fails. Just as in 780 F.2d 1158, endorsement of the officers’ actions post-incident does not alone prove a municipal policy of unconstitutional conduct. Further, as noted in 588 F.3d 838, the lack of evidence showing a widespread and persistent unconstitutional practice among officers in Wichita Falls means Zarnow has not met the requisite burden to establish a custom or policy under Monell.

Thus, without sufficient evidence of a pattern or explicit policy endorsing the alleged unconstitutional act, summary judgment in favor of the City stands.
