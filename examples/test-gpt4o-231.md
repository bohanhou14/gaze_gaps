The Fifth Circuit in Dameron v. United States, 488 F.2d 724 (5th Cir. 1974), similarly avoided the constitutional issue by interpreting § 922(g)(1) to only apply to constitutionally convicted felons. In contrast, our interpretation of §§ 922(d)(1) and 922(a)(6) aligns with Congress's intent to restrict firearm access to those with standing felony convictions, even if they may later be deemed constitutionally invalid. This approach ensures the effectiveness of the legislative scheme and avoids collateral issues similar to those complicated by prior case laws as seen in Cody v. United States, 529 F.2d 564 (8th Cir. 1975), and United States v. DuShane, 435 F.2d 187 (2d Cir. 1970).

Additionally, in United States v. Liles, 457 F.2d 165 (9th Cir. 1970), the court held that the status of the conviction at the time of the firearms offense was determinative, regardless of any subsequent changes. Thus, even a conviction pending appeal at the time of a firearms offense could support a conviction under § 1202(a), reinforcing the notion that Congress seeks to avoid dispensing firearms to those reasonably believed to have engaged in felonious activity.

Therefore, Allen's standing felony convictions provide reasonable grounds for the restriction under § 922(a)(6), and the statute, as applied, does not violate his constitutional rights. AFFIRMED.
