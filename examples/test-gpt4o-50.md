To merit habeas relief, it must be shown that no reasonable jurist could find the state court's application of clearly established federal law to be appropriate. Under AEDPA, "the federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly" (870 F.3d 1003). For Weathers, this requirement is not met because the state court's adjudication was consistent with established Supreme Court precedent.

Further, Davis establishes that a miscarriage of justice exception is not applicable when there is no substantial claim of actual innocence or new evidence that could have negated a reasonable juror's conviction (854 F.3d 967). In Weathers's case, no such claim or new evidence exists to warrant application of this exception.

Moreover, this court acknowledges that Moore's holding regarding adaptive strengths is merely an application of what was previously established by Atkins, demonstrating that post-dated Supreme Court decisions cannot be "clearly established law" for the purposes of AEDPA if it post-dates the state courtâ€™s judgment (881 F.3d 483). Therefore, the court's reliance on pre-Moore standards does not constitute an unreasonable application of federal law.

In conclusion, in line with Shoop v. Hill and relevant precedents, Weathers's Atkins claim remains insufficient for federal habeas relief. Thus, we affirm the district court's judgment.
