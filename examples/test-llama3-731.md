In determining the statute of limitations for Section 1983 claims, courts must turn to state law. Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 269 (1985). In this case, the parties agree that the applicable statute of limitations is two years, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 9-3-33. The dispute centers on when the claims accrued.

The district court found that all claims accrued prior to August 10, 1982, and therefore were time-barred. However, the court erred in its analysis. Under Section 1983, a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff knows or should know that he has been injured and that the defendant has caused the injury. Calhoun v. Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, 705 F.2d 422, 425 (1983). In this case, Mullinax did not become aware of Keller's and Sticher's involvement in the entrapment attempts until August 12, 1982, when she was arrested.

Therefore, any cause of action arising out of the entrapment attempts could not have accrued before August 12, 1982. The court's finding that the claims accrued prior to August 10, 1982, was error. The correct date for accrual is August 12, 1982. As a result, the district court's order granting summary judgment on the remaining claims is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

The court's decision is supported by the Supreme Court's holding in Wilson v. Garcia, which states that "only the length of the limitations period, and the closely related questions of tolling and application, are to be governed by state law." 471 U.S. at 269. In this case, the state law is clear: the statute of limitations is two years, and the cause of action accrued on August 12, 1982.

In conclusion, the district court's order granting summary judgment on the remaining claims is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. The correct date for accrual of the cause of action is August 12, 1982, and the statute of limitations is two years.

gold_text: . Nor can they. Although Section 1983 does not contain a specific statute of limitations, 42 U.S. C.A. § 1988 directs courts in Section 1983 actions to apply the most appropriate and analogous state statute of limitations. Burnett v. Grattan, 468 U.S. 42, 47-48, 104 S.Ct. 2924, 2928, 82 L.Ed.2d 36 (1984); Board of Regents v. Tomanio, 446 U.S. 478, 483-86, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 1794-96, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980). In Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 276-79, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1947-49, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985), the Supreme Court interpreted the dictates of Section 1988 as requiring in all Section 1983 actions the application of the state limitations statute governing "personal injury” claims. Thus, under Wilson, the proper limitations period for all Section 1983 actions in Georgia is the two-year limitations period set forth in O.C.G.A. § 9-3-33. Williams v. City of Atlanta, 794 F.2d 624, 626 (11th Cir.1986). Furthermore, in Williams, this Court determined that Wilson is to be applied retroactively, at least in Section 1983 cases arising out of Georgia. Id. at 625-28. See abo Jones v. Preuit & Mauldin, 763 F.2d 1250, 1253 n. 2 (11th Cir.1985), cert. denied, _ U.S. _, 106 S.Ct. 893, 88 L.Ed.2d 926 (1986) (applying Wibon retroactively in Alabama Section 1983 case where parties did not dispute its retroactivity). Therefore, this action is barred unless commenced within two years of its accrual.
