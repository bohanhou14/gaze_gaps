In the case discussed, the defendant, Walter J. Kussmaul, was charged with causing obscene material to be mailed in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1461. The prosecution argued that the Government's sting operation did not entrap the defendant, as he had a predisposition to commit the crime. The court held that the Government's proof of predisposition was sufficient to overcome any entrapment claim.

The court cited the case of Jacobson v. United States, 112 S.Ct. 1535 (1992), where the Supreme Court held that the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had a predisposition to commit the crime before the Government's investigation and that this predisposition existed independent of the Government's contacts with the defendant. The court also noted that the Government's proof of predisposition must be established with evidence obtained prior to its initial contact with the targeted individual.

The court also referred to the case of United States v. Johnson, 855 F.2d 299 (6th Cir.1988), where the court held that the Government's proof of predisposition must be established with evidence obtained prior to its initial contact with the targeted individual.

In the present case, the court held that the Government's proof of predisposition was established through the defendant's own statements and actions. The defendant had previously sent a letter to the Government indicating his interest in receiving obscene material, and he had also enclosed a copy of his earlier correspondence. The court concluded that the Government's proof of predisposition was sufficient to overcome any entrapment claim.

The court also noted that the defendant's conviction was upheld under the ex post facto clause of the Constitution. The court held that the application of the Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of the defendant's sentence was constitutional, as it did not impose more severe punishment than the punishment prescribed by law at the time the crime was committed.

In conclusion, the court held that the Government's proof of predisposition was sufficient to overcome any entrapment claim, and the defendant's conviction was upheld under the ex post facto clause of the Constitution. The court's decision is consistent with the holdings in Jacobson v. United States and United States v. Johnson.
