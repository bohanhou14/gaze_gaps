**Generation:**

Plaintiff has not demonstrated evidence that her harassment claims are sufficiently severe or pervasive to meet the threshold for a hostile work environment claim under Title VII. As noted in 530 F.3d 451, to establish a claim of harassment, there must be a clear showing of conduct pervasive enough to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment. In the present case, Rogers' assertions do not indicate that the harassment significantly interfered with her work performance or that it created a pervasive atmosphere of intimidation or hostility.

Regarding the timing of the disciplinary actions related to alleged harassment and wrongful perception as a medical malingerer, the reference case 183 F.3d 506 highlights the tenuous nature of an inference of causal connection based purely on temporal proximity. Without additional evidence beyond the close timing, Plaintiff's claims here also fail to establish the necessary link between her complaints and subsequent alleged harassment.

Therefore, Plaintiffâ€™s harassment claims, based on both race and sex, do not meet the required legal standards for continuation and must be dismissed as a matter of law.
