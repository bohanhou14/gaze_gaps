As the Assistant, I would like to provide a detailed analysis of the case and its implications. The reference cases mentioned are 494 F.2d 485, 515 F.2d 1195, and 523 F.2d 1367.

In the case of 523 F.2d 1367, the court held that resort to the state agency is mandatory, and the state limitations period governs the availability of a federal remedy. The court also noted that the ADEA requires compliance with the state limitations period, but if the failure to comply is due to lack of knowledge or ignorance, the claimant may file a notice of intent to sue with the Secretary of Labor within 180 days and still be entitled to a federal remedy.

In 494 F.2d 485, the court held that the notice provision of the ADEA is jurisdictional and must be pleaded. The court also noted that the notice must be filed within the shorter federal period of 180 days.

In 515 F.2d 1195, the court held that the notice provision of the ADEA is jurisdictional and must be pleaded, and that the notice must be filed within the shorter federal period of 180 days.

In conclusion, the reference cases mentioned above have significant implications for the case at hand. The court must consider the mandatory resort to the state agency, the state limitations period, and the notice provision of the ADEA. If the failure to comply with the state limitations period is due to lack of knowledge or ignorance, the claimant may still be entitled to a federal remedy. The notice provision of the ADEA is jurisdictional and must be pleaded, and the notice must be filed within the shorter federal period of 180 days.

gold_text: . Current case law has only dealt with ยง 626(d) as jurisdictional. (Hiscott, supra; Powell v. Southwestern Bell, 494 F.2d 485 (5 Cir. 1974); Edwards v. Kaiser Aluminum, 515 F.2d 1195 (5th Cir. 1975)). In addition, there has been some tendency to isolate ยง 626(d) as containing the jurisdictional prerequisites. (See Ott v.
