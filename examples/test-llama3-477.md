MEMORANDUM OPINION
The issue at hand is whether the court has jurisdiction to consider a motion for judgment of acquittal filed outside the seven-day time period set forth in Rule 29(c), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In United States v. Lema, 909 F.2d 561 (1st Cir. 1990), the court held that the time limit for filing Rule 29(c) motions is not jurisdictional. This ruling is supported by Arizona v. Manypenny, 672 F.2d 761 (9th Cir. 1982), which held that the court's inherent power to grant a judgment of acquittal is not limited by the time constraints of Rule 29(c).

In United States v. Giampa, 758 F.2d 928 (3rd Cir. 1985), the court further clarified that the court's power to enter a judgment of acquittal is not limited to those entered sua sponte, but also extends to those occasions when a motion is made and granted. Similarly, in United States v. Broadus, 664 F.Supp. 592 (D.D.C. 1987), the court noted that the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Gaddis, 424 U.S. 544 (1976), recognizes a court's responsibility to ensure that the evidence supports the jury's verdict, regardless of whether the defendant has asked the court to undertake the inquiry.

In the instant case, defendant Hughes filed a motion for judgment of acquittal outside the seven-day time period set forth in Rule 29(c). However, in light of the authorities cited above, it is clear that the court has jurisdiction to consider the motion. The court's review of the record reveals that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support a guilty verdict. Therefore, the court hereby grants the motion for judgment of acquittal and acquits defendant Hughes of the charges against him.

gold_text: This is the entire testimony referring to Hughes. The question is whether this evidence supports Hughes’ conviction for aiding and abetting in the manufacture of amphetamine. In making this determination, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, giving the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences which may logically be drawn therefrom. See Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); United States v. Marin-Cifuentes, 866 F.2d 988 (8th Cir.1989), cert. den., — U.S. —, 110 S.Ct. 110, 107 L.Ed.2d 72 (1989). The evidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence but simply be sufficient to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Hughes aided and abetted in the manufacture. Marin-Cifuentes, supra; United States v. Wells, 721 F.2d 1160 (8th Cir. 1983). This court may set aside the verdict only if the evidence is such that a “reasonable-minded jury must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the proof of at least one of the essential elements of the offense.” United States v. Noibi, 780 F.2d 1419 (8th Cir.1986).
