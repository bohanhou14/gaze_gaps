The case at hand involves a claim of First Amendment violation by a Bensalem Township Council member, Arthur Wilkinson, against the Township, Council President Szafran, Councilwoman Dornisch, and Councilman Costello. Wilkinson alleges that his right to free expression was violated when Szafran, as chairman of the meeting, refused to permit him to speak during the public portion of the August 24 Council meeting. Wilkinson also claims that Dornisch and Costello joined in with Szafran in suppressing his right to speak.

To determine whether the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, we must identify the specific constitutional right allegedly violated, determine whether it was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation, and inquire whether a reasonable person in the defendant's position would have known that their conduct violated that right (Collinson v. Gott, 895 F.2d 994, 998 (4th Cir.1990), citing Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)).

In this case, the right allegedly violated is Wilkinson's right to free expression under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This right is clearly established, as the Supreme Court has consistently recognized that local officials presiding over duly-called public meetings may offend First Amendment rights when they make ad hoc parliamentary rulings (Collinson, 895 F.2d at 1003 (Phillips, J., concurring), citing Jones v. Heyman, 888 F.2d 1328 (11th Cir.1989), Musso v. Hourigan, 836 F.2d 736 (2d Cir. 1988), and Brown v. Smythe, 780 F.Supp. 274 (E.D.Pa.1991)).

However, a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding Szafran's motive for silencing Wilkinson. Therefore, we deny Wilkinson's motion for partial summary judgment and defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to Szafran.

As for Dornisch and Costello, they had no affirmative, clearly established duty to prevent Szafran's alleged infringement of Wilkinson's constitutional rights. We conclude that the doctrine of qualified immunity protects their failure to act, and grant defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to them.

gold_text: To prevail on the theory that Szafran implemented a custom or policy of the Township which violated Wilkinson’s rights, Wilkinson must show that the Township’s failure to educate its Councilmembers about the state of the law was an established practice “ ‘so permanent and well settled as to constitute a “custom or usage” with the force of law.’ ” Monell, 436 U.S. at 691, 98 S.Ct. at 2036, quoting Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 167-68, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1613, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). To support a finding of “policy or custom”, Wilkinson must at least show that the municipality did not implement necessary training to ensure that employees would not violate the constitutional rights of the persons with whom they came into contact. Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). Specifically, Wilkinson must prove:
