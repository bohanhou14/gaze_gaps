The defense cites the case law to argue insufficiency of evidence, but it is unpersuasive. In 10 U.S.C.M.A. 122 and 27 C.M.R. 196, appellants similarly argued that requested instructions were binding and their absence was prejudicial, but courts found no merit since acquittals on related charges dispelled prejudice concerns.

Additionally, the contention that accused’s belief in consent warrants an affirmative mistake-of-fact instruction is unsupported by evidence. Both cases refute such expansiveness in defense claims without concrete basis (10 U.S.C.M.A. 122, 27 C.M.R. 196). Here, the testimony and circumstances clearly negate a reasonable belief in consent.  

Regarding the sufficiency of penetration evidence, 8 M.J. 598 sets precedence that both direct and circumstantial evidence establishing non-consensual penetration beyond a reasonable doubt is sufficient. Similar principles apply here, with ample testimony and circumstantial evidence substantiating the offense.

Therefore, the defense’s claims of insufficient evidence and credibility issues are unavailing. The trial court's judgment is supported by law and evidence, aligning with established legal precedents.

gold_text: In a supplemental assignment of error the defense contends the government failed to establish that the prosecutrix was not the wife of the accused. The non-marital status between the victim and the accused at the time of the act is an essential element of rape. United States v. Williams, 40 C.M.R. 521 (A.B.R.1969). Penetration and the accused’s identity are also essential elements that may be established by circumstantial evidence. United States v. Stephens, 14 C.M.R. 321 (A.B.R.1954); United States v. Hunter, 6 C.M.R. 349 (1954). Further, that standard of proof in a circumstantial evidence case is no higher than one proved by direct evidence. United States v. Jones, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 122, 27 C.M.R. 196 (C.M.A.1959). While there is no direct testimony that the accused and the prosecutrix were not husband and wife, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence that they were not. Thus, we find that this element of the offense is established beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Guilford, 8 M.J. 598 (A.C.M.R.1979); See also State v. Twyford, 186 N.W.2d 545, 85 S.D. 522 (1971).
