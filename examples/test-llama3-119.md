I have analyzed the legal cases provided and written a summary of the case of Rose v. Niland, which involves a habeas corpus petition filed by the appellant, Neil Niland, who was convicted of second-degree murder and unlawful possession of a rifle. The case raises issues related to the trial judge's instructions to the jury, specifically regarding malice aforethought and consciousness of guilt.

The Massachusetts Appeals Court reviewed the trial judge's instructions and concluded that they did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The court also found that the inclusion of the phrase "grievous bodily harm" in the malice instruction was harmless error, as the evidence did not warrant a finding of a risk of harm less than a strong likelihood of death. The court also reviewed the consciousness of guilt instruction and concluded that it was correct under Massachusetts law.

The district court, in turn, reviewed Niland's claims and found that the trial judge's instructions did not violate his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court concluded that the erroneous "grievous bodily harm" phrase did not "so infect the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process" (citing Henderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145, 154, 97 S.Ct. 1730, 52 L.Ed.2d 203 (1977)). The court also rejected Niland's claim that the consciousness of guilt instruction relieved the Commonwealth of its burden to prove all elements of the offense, distinguishing Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985).

In conclusion, the court's review of the trial judge's instructions and the district court's denial of Niland's habeas corpus petition are affirmed. This case illustrates the importance of considering the context and overall charges in evaluating the correctness of jury instructions, as well as the need to distinguish between harmless error and substantive due process violations.
