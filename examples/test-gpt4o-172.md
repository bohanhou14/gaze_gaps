To address the context and the equity principles governing the plaintiff’s claims, several precedents offer valuable insights. In Bullen v. State of Wisconsin, 240 U.S. 625, referenced in 71 F.2d 214, it was underscored that the legality of a tax-saving transaction does not solely hinge on its intent to avoid taxes but on adherence to lawful means. Similarly, United States v. Isham, as cited in 17 Wall. 496 and reiterated in 84 U.S. 496 and 39 F.2d 777, reinforces that legitimate tax avoidance tactics, if executed correctly, do not inherently constitute fraud or wrongdoing.

Reflecting on these precedents, the plaintiff’s claim that it deserves a share of the reorganized subsidiary’s tax savings conflicts with the established principles that lawful tax reductions must conform strictly to statutory provisions. Despite the intricate tax maneuvers and the considerable sums involved, equity cannot aid in redistributing these tax savings, as they fundamentally rest on the debtor’s legitimate operations and earnings.

In essence, referencing the cited cases solidifies that while the tax strategy employed might be lawful, recognizing plaintiff’s claim contravenes the rightful execution of the reorganization plan and the essence of Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. Thus, the decision must respect both the letter and spirit of the law, leaving the parties as determined by the reorganization decree.
