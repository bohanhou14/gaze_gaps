In the present case, the Court must determine the true nature of the $90,000 Award. It is evident that, while both parties treated at least twelve of the $2,000 monthly payments as alimony for tax purposes, this does not necessarily control the determination of the true nature of the payment.

Echoing the Ninth Circuit BAP's reasoning in In re Kritt (190 B.R. 382), mere tax treatment does not bind the Court to consider these payments as alimony (264 B.R. 894). The Court must look beyond the form and labels used by the parties and assess the underlying intent and circumstances (216 B.R. 806). The policy considerations underpinning § 523(a)(5) emphasize examining the substance of the transaction over form to enforce familial support obligations while avoiding inconsistent results, as noted by various courts rejecting the quasi-estoppel doctrine (222 B.R. 918).

Given the details surrounding the $90,000 Award, it aligns more closely with a property settlement rather than support, particularly due to the valuation of EST and the division of assets reflected in the Decree. Thus, considering the evidence and prevalent legal standards, the $90,000 Award should be characterized as a property settlement.

gold_text: Kritt v. Kritt (In re Kritt), 190 B.R. 382, 388-389 (9th Cir. BAP 1995) (citations and footnote omitted) (hereafter “Kritt”). The Kritt analysis has met with wide acceptance. See Sillins v. Sillins (In re Sillins), 264 B.R. 894, 898 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 2001); Horner v. Horner (In re Horner), 222 B.R. 918, 923 n. 5 (S.D.Ga.1998); Kelley v. Kelley (In re Kelley), 216 B.R. 806, 809-10 (Bankr.E.D.Tenn.1998). This Court, after a thorough review of the case law, finds the analysis in Kritt to be the most compelling and in line with the statements contained in Sampson, and thus holds that the treatment of a payment as alimony for income tax purposes is but one factor to be considered by a bankruptcy court in making its determination under § 523(a)(5).
