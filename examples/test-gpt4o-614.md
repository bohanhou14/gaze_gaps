Additionally, we find that the appellant’s contention that appellees are estopped from claiming a failure to exhaust administrative remedies is without merit. Estoppel principles were considered and rejected in similar contexts as illustrated in the case reported in 154 F.2d 436, where the court found no grounds for recovery based on estoppel due to lack of compliance with necessary procedural prerequisites.

Furthermore, the appellant's reliance on the Act of March 16, 1939 (105 F.2d 58), is misplaced as it does not alter the jurisdictional requirements providing primary authority to the Federal Power Commission. The necessity for compliance with administrative procedures before seeking judicial intervention remains a cornerstone of administrative law, as reaffirmed in these precedent cases.

The claims raised under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act also do not suffice to bypass the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies. The case referenced in 59 F.2d 529 emphasizes the principle of addressing primary jurisdiction administrative issues prior to judicial review, upholding the doctrine even where anti-trust violations are alleged.

Given these considerations, the judgment of the District Court dismissing the action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies is affirmed.

gold_text: Appellant’s alleged cause of action based on the refusal of appellee to transport its gas is, in effect, a collateral attack upon an order of the Commission. Appellant’s real grievance concerns the contract made by appellees for carrying gas through their pipeline. We may take judicial notice of records and reports of administrative bodies. Greeson v. Imperial Irr. Dist., 9 Cir., 1932, 59 F.2d 529; Fletcher v. Jones, D.C. Cir.1939, 105 F.2d 58, certiorari denied 308 U.S. 555, 60 S.Ct. 116, 84 L.Ed. 467. In doing so we observe that the construction of the pipeline here involved was based upon a thirty-year contract whereby appellees obligated themselves to carry not only a minimum load factor of 91% of the pipeline’s capacity, but for its entire use if necessary. In re El Paso Natural Gas Co., 1946, 5 Federal Power Commission Reports 115. The Commission, after a public hearing, issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the pipeline upon the terms of which appellant complains. Appellees are bound to conform to the provisions of that contract unless relieved by the Commission. 15 U.S.C.A. § 717c (d). They could not carry appellant’s gas without violating their contract and the certificate of public convenience and necessity. The combination and conspiracy in restraint of trade, alleged in the amended complaint, is no more than criticism of appellees for conforming with the contract on file and approved by the Commission. Appellant cannot, by means of this suit for damages, indirectly annul the action taken by the Commission. Edward Chappell Co. v. Chesapeake & O. R. Co., D.C.N.Y. 1952, 110 F.Supp. 46, affirmed 2 Cir., 1953, 202 F.2d 149; Watab Paper Company v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 8 Cir., 1946, 154 F.2d 436.
