Memorandum Opinion and Order

This case involves a dispute between FirstMerit Bank and Maria Ferrari, Juan Salgado, Robert Ferrari, and Cortland Properties, Inc. ("Cortland Properties"). FirstMerit brought a mortgage foreclosure action against the defendants, alleging that they failed to make timely payments on a promissory note. The defendants counterclaimed, alleging that FirstMerit discriminated against them based on their race, in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ("ECOA") and 42 U.S.C. § 1981.

In considering the defendants' counterclaims, the court applied the pleading standards outlined in Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The court held that the defendants' allegations, while not detailed, were sufficient to state a plausible claim for relief and survive dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).

The court rejected FirstMerit's argument that the defendants waived their counterclaims by signing a forbearance agreement. The court found that the waiver provision in the agreement was narrow and did not cover the defendants' ECOA and § 1981 claims, which arose outside the scope of the waiver.

The court also rejected FirstMerit's argument that the defendants lacked standing to bring a § 1981 claim. The court held that the defendants had standing because they were parties to a contractual relationship with FirstMerit and alleged that FirstMerit's actions were motivated by discriminatory animus.

Finally, the court rejected FirstMerit's argument that the defendants failed to plead a viable ECOA claim. The court held that the defendants' allegations were sufficient to state a claim under the ECOA, which prohibits creditors from discriminating against applicants based on race.

In reaching its decision, the court relied on the following cases: Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451 (2006), Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.S. 1 (2010), Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 134 S.Ct. 1377 (2014), Cult Awareness Network v. Cult Awareness Network, 750 F.3d 659 (2014), and Hamilton v. O'Connor Chevrolet, Inc., 2004 WL 1403711 (N

gold_text: FirstMerit contends that Cortland' Properties, Robert, and Maria have no “standing” under § 1981 because they themselves were not the target of racial discrimination. Doc. 45 at 6-7. (Scare quotes are placed around “standing” because, as explained in Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., — U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1377, 188 L.Ed.2d 392 (2014), whether a particular statute allows a particular plaintiff to seek redress thereunder is a matter of statutory interpretation, not standing. See Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Johnston, 763 F.3d 723, 733-34 (7th Cir.2014); In re C.P. Hall Co., 750 F.3d 659, 660-61 (7th Cir.2014).) In response, Defendants say absolutely nothing; they argue only that Salgado has “standing” under § 1981. Doc. 53 at 7-8. Defendants thus have forfeited any argument they might have had to support the ability of Cortland Properties, Robert, and Maria to pursue the § 1981 claim. See G & S Holdings, 697 F.3d at 538.
