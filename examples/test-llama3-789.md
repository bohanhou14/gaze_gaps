The case before us presents a similar situation to that in United States v. Telfaire, 538 F.2d 770, where the issue of identification was crucial to the conviction. In Telfaire, the court held that a jury instruction on identification should be given when the sole basis for the conviction is eyewitness testimony. Similarly, in the instant case, the eyewitness identification of the defendant by Rena Bad Horse was the sole basis for the conviction.

The court in Telfaire also emphasized the importance of alerting the jury to the crucial role eyewitness identification plays in the case. In the instant case, the district judge failed to give a specific instruction on identification, which could have alerted the jury to the importance of scrutinizing the identification testimony.

Furthermore, the court in United States v. Dodge, 562 F.2d 542, stated that the failure to give specific and detailed instructions on identification in future cases where identification of the defendant is based solely or substantially on eyewitness testimony will be viewed with grave concern. In the instant case, the identification of the defendant was based solely on eyewitness testimony, and therefore, the failure to give a specific instruction on identification constitutes reversible error.

In conclusion, based on the cases mentioned above, the court must give a specific instruction on identification when the sole basis for the conviction is eyewitness testimony. Failure to do so may result in reversible error. Therefore, the judgment of conviction is reversed and remanded for a new trial.
