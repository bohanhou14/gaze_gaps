MEMORANDUM OPINION
COLLEEN KOLLAR-KOTELLY, United States District Judge

Plaintiff Noble Energy, Inc., disputes the order issued by the United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) requiring the permanent plugging of an offshore well, Well OCS-P 0320, No. 2. BSEE asserts its authority to require plugging under its decommissioning regulations, found at 30 C.F.R. §§ 250.1700-1754, issued pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq.

In United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 113 S.Ct. 1631, 123 L.Ed.2d 245 (1993), the Supreme Court held that statutes which invade the common law must be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident. Noble Energy argues that the decommissioning regulations do not explicitly abrogate the common law principle of discharge and, therefore, the principle of discharge must be read into the regulation. However, the Court concludes that there is no authority to support importing the principle of discharge into a non-contractual obligation.

In Noble Energy, Inc. v. Salazar, 671 F.3d 1241 (D.C.Cir.2012), the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the case to the agency for further proceedings. On remand, the BSEE issued the April 9, 2014, Order at issue, concluding that the decommissioning regulations impose an independent obligation to plug the well, regardless of the government's breach of the lease. The Court concludes that the agency's interpretation is reasonable and defers to the agency's expertise.

The Court also addresses the principle of discharge, citing cases such as ABN Amro Bank v. United States, 34 Fed.Cl. 126 (1995), and Amoco Production v. Fry, 904 F.Supp. 3 (D.D.C.1995). However, the Court concludes that these cases do not support the application of the principle of discharge to the regulatory decommissioning obligations at issue in this case.

The Court grants Defendants' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and denies Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, upholding

citations: ['243 F.3d 1367', '243 F.3d 1367', '106 F.3d 1456', '106 F.3d 1456']

gold_text: In still other cases, courts have concluded that common law principles helped to interpret the meaning of a specific statutory or regulatory scheme as a result of the particular interplay between the common law rule and the statutory or regulatory scheme in question. See, e.g., Ins. Co. of the West v. United States, 243 F.3d 1367, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2001) (common law rights of assignees unchanged by waiver of sovereign immunity in Tucker Act); In re Niles, 106 F.3d 1456, 1461 (9th Cir.1997) (common law allocation of burdens of proof bolsters conclusions regarding burden of proof under Bankruptcy Act provision). Taken together, these cases confirm that there is no general principle — as Plaintiff maintains — that a common law principle ' like the discharge rule should be automati-. cally read into a regulatory scheme such as the one at issue here. These case do establish that explicit language — at least more explicit than presented in this case— would be necessary to abrogate the discharge rule itself. Importantly, however, BSEE has not abrogated that rule, which by its own terms applies to contractual obligations. BSEE concluded that the regulatory requirements regarding decommissioning are independent of the contractual decommissioning obligations, and, for the reasons stated above, this conclusion is not “plainly erroneous” or “inconsistent with the regulation.” There is no principle in the case law that would require this Court to read into the independent regulatory decommissioning requirements a version of the discharge rule. In sum, none of Plaintiffs arguments lead the Court to conclude that the agency’s order is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Accordingly, BSEE’s order requiring Noble Energy to carry out its regulatory decommissioning obligations regarding Well OCS-P 0320, No. 2, survives this Court’s deferential standard of review.
