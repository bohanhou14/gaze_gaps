The cases presented in this reference guide demonstrate the complexities of corporate liquidations and the importance of accurately characterizing distributions to shareholders and creditors. In the case of Wilbur v. Commissioner, the court held that the forgiveness of accrued salaries, bonuses, and interest by the shareholders of Braddock Land Co., Inc. lacked a business purpose and economic substance, and was therefore disregarded for Federal tax purposes.

Similarly, in Gregory v. Helvering, the court established the doctrine that a transaction that lacks a valid economic purpose will be disregarded for tax purposes, even if it complies with the formal statutory requirements. This doctrine has been applied in various contexts, including corporate reorganizations and liquidations.

In the case of H. G. Hill Stores, Inc. v. Commissioner, the court held that the liquidation provisions of section 112(b)(6) only encompass distributions of assets to stockholders in cancellation and redemption of their stock, and do not include distributions made to a creditor for the discharge of outstanding obligations.

Furthermore, the court in Northern Coal & Dock Co. v. Commissioner held that the liquidation provisions do not apply to distributions made to a creditor for the discharge of outstanding obligations, and that such distributions should be characterized as ordinary income.

The cases presented in this reference guide demonstrate the importance of accurately characterizing distributions to shareholders and creditors in the context of corporate liquidations, and highlight the need for careful consideration of the economic substance and business purpose of such transactions.

gold_text: We have also long recognized that amounts paid to a shareholder-creditor upon liquidation must first be applied to satisfy any outstanding indebtedness, and only the remainder of the assets distributed constitutes a distribution in liquidation in exchange for his stock. Houston Natural Gas Corp. v. Commissioner, 9 T.C. 570, 574 (1947), affd. 173 F.2d 461 (5th Cir. 1949). See also Spaulding Bakeries, Inc. v. Commissioner, 27 T.C. 684, 687 (1957), affd. 252 F.2d 693 (2d Cir. 1958); Menzies, Inc. v. Commissioner, 34 B.T.A. 163, 168 (1936). In circumstances where the amount distributed is less than the debt obligations of the corporation, so that no amount is available for distribution to the shareholders on account of their stock, it has been held that no liquidating distribution was made, thus rendering the liquidation provisions totally inapplicable. Jorden v. Commissioner, supra at 922; Iron Fireman Manufacturing Co. v. Commissioner, 5 T.C. 452, 462 (1945); Aldrich v. Commissioner, 1 T.C. 602 (1943); Glenmore Distilleries Co. v. Commissioner, 47 B.T.A. 213, 227 (1942); H. G. Hill Stores, Inc. v. Commissioner, supra. Similarly, where, as in the present case, a corporation is indebted to a shareholder-creditor for services rendered or for interest, amounts distributed by the corporation when it liquidates are taxable at ordinary income rates to the extent of the amount of the debt, and the excess is taxable at capital gains rates to the extent it exceeds their basis in the stock.

Commissioner, 58 T.C. 825, 834 (1972), affd. in an unpublished opinion 487 F. 2d 1404 (7th Cir. 1973).
