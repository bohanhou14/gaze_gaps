The cases presented involve legal disputes and contractual agreements. In Reference case 243 F.3d 936, the court addressed the issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity and the jurisdiction of the district court. The court held that the defendant was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity and that the district court had jurisdiction to hear the case.

In Reference case 985 F.2d 824, the court examined the language of a subcontract and a performance bond. The court concluded that the surety's liability was governed by the terms of the bond, and that the surety was not liable for damages.

In Reference case 17 F.3d 106, the court analyzed the statute of limitations and the definition of the term "issued." The court held that the notice of intent to reconsider was "issued" on the date it was mailed, not on the date it was received. The court also concluded that the complaint was filed simultaneously with the notice of intent to reconsider, and that the applicable 90-day period within which to file suit had not expired.

In conclusion, these cases demonstrate the importance of careful analysis and interpretation of legal language. The courts in these cases applied relevant legal principles and definitions to resolve the disputes before them. The cases highlight the need for parties to carefully review and understand the terms of their contracts and agreements, and to consider the potential implications of certain language or actions.

gold_text: Alamo cross-appeals the district court’s denial of its motion to dismiss on grounds of Alamo’s Eleventh Amendment immunity. Martin argues that we are precluded from considering the merits of this issue because Alamo did not file a timely notice of appeal. We need not decide whether Alamo’s notice of appeal was timely because Alamo inadequately briefed the issue and, thus, abandoned its Eleventh Amendment arguments. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. City of El Paso, 243 F.3d 936, 940 (5th Cir.2001) (dismissing appeal as abandoned because the Appellant failed to challenge the district court’s application of the applicable test for Eleventh Amendment immunity); Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., 985 F.2d 824, 831 (5th Cir.0993); L & A Contracting Co. v. Southern Concrete Servs., 17 F.3d 106, 113 (5th Cir.1994)(holding appeal to be abandoned because appellant cited no authority in a one-page argument); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (requiring argument to contain “appellant’s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies”). The appeal on this issue is DISMISSED.
