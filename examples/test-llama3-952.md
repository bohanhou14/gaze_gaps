However, the plaintiff is arguing that the procedures are unconstitutional because they do not provide a hearing or trial before the amount of restitution is charged and withdrawn from the prisoner's account.

The court finds that the procedures are constitutional because they comply with the requirements of due process as outlined in the reference case 470 U.S. 532, which states that a deprivation of life, liberty, or property must be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case. The court also finds that the procedures comply with the requirements of due process as outlined in the reference case 339 U.S. 306, which states that a deprivation of life, liberty, or property must be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.

This is in line with the requirements of due process as outlined in the reference case 401 U.S. 371, which states that a deprivation of life, liberty, or property must be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.
