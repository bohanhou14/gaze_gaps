To determine the proper venue for the legal case, we must consider the language of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), which states that a claim may be brought in the district where all defendants reside or where the claim arose. In the case of 443 U.S. 173, the Supreme Court held that a claim may arise in multiple districts, and the plaintiff may choose between them if the districts may be assigned as the locus of the claim with approximately equal plausibility. The court considered the availability of witnesses, the accessibility of other relevant evidence, and the convenience of the defendant, but not the convenience of the plaintiff.

In this case, the record does not clearly indicate that the claim arose in one obvious locus. The events and defendants' acts occurred in California, and the injury probably occurred in Missouri. Therefore, we must employ a Leroy-type analysis to determine where the claims arose. The court concludes that the plaintiff's claims arose in California, where the majority of relevant witnesses and evidence are located, and where the defendants reside.

According to 406 U.S. 706, the venue laws are intended to provide a convenient forum for the defendants, and the court must consider the factors that make a district a more convenient forum. In this case, California is the more convenient forum for the defendants, as they reside there and their ongoing business would suffer less inconvenience if their principals are not required to be out-of-state for a trial.

Therefore, the court concludes that venue is improper in the district of Kansas, and the case should be transferred to the Central District of California. The motion to transfer for improper venue is granted, and the motion to dismiss defendant Angel Echevarria for lack of personal jurisdiction is denied as moot.

gold_text: . Some courts have narrowly construed § 1391(b) to allow venue in the district where the claim arose only when multiple defendants do not reside in one judicial district. Relying on footnotes in two Supreme Court cases, Leroy v. Great Western United Corp., 443 U.S. 173, 184 n. 17, 99 S.Ct. 2710, 2717 n. 17, 61 L.Ed.2d 464 (1979) and Brunette Machine Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U.S. 706, 710 n. 8, 92 S.Ct. 1936, 1939 n. 8, 32 L.Ed.2d 428 (1972), the following courts have concluded that the "claim arose” alternative in § 1391(b) is available only when needed to close "venue gaps” that occur when multiple defendants reside in different districts: Canaday v. Koch, 598 F.Supp. 1139, 1148 (E.D.N.Y.1984); Southern Marine Research, Inc. v. Jetronic Industries, Inc., 590 F.Supp. 1192, 1194 (D.Conn.1984); Pfieffer v. International Academy of Biomagnetic Medicine, 521 F.Supp. 1331, 1336 (W.D.Mo.1981). Other courts construe § 1391(b) as providing two equal alternatives for venue. Because venue is not proper in Kansas under either construction, we need not decide which construction is proper.
