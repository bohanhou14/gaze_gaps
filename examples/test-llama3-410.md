The defendants claim that they are entitled to qualified immunity for their actions, arguing that they had no notice of a specific constitutional right to privacy for persons with HIV and that they acted "objectively reasonably" in listing Doe's and Roe's names in the manual. The district court concluded that a constitutional right to privacy as to one's HIV status existed as of September 1992, but held that the defendants' actions were objectively reasonable because they believed that Doe and Roe had waived their right to privacy by publicly identifying themselves as persons living with HIV.

The defendants' qualified immunity defense is based on Behrens v. Newton, 516 U.S. 307, 116 S.Ct. 851, 134 L.Ed.2d 18 (1996), which permits an appeal where a defendant contends that the immunity defense is established on those facts alleged by the plaintiff that the district court ruled were sufficiently supported to create a jury issue. Behrens, — U.S. at —, 116 S.Ct. at 842, citing Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995).

In Johnson, the Supreme Court held that a court of appeals may have to undertake a "cumbersome review of the record to determine what facts the district court, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, likely assumed." Johnson, — U.S. at —, 115 S.Ct. at 2159. The court also noted that a defendant can support an immunity defense by claiming that the conduct was objectively reasonable. Id.

In this case, the defendants have not identified any facts that would support a claim that their actions were not objectively reasonable. Therefore, their qualified immunity defense is not established and they are not entitled to immunity. The defendants' motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds is denied.

gold_text: The defendants further move for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. Government actors who perform discretionary functions are protected from liability for civil damages where their conduct does not' violate a clearly established constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known. Doe v. Marsh, 105 F.3d 106, 109 (2d Cir.1997); Salim v. Proulx, 93 F.3d 86, 89 (2d Cir.1996); Lennon v. Miller, 66 F.3d 416, 420 (2d Cir.1995). Even where the plaintiffs rights and the scope of the officials’ permissible conduct are clearly established, the qualified immunity defense protects a governmental actor if it was “objectively reasonable” for the actor to believe that his actions were lawful at the time of the alleged unlawful conduct. Marsh, 105 F.3d at 109-10; Lennon, 66 F.3d at 420.
