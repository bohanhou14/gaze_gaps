The case at hand involves a pregnancy discrimination claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiff, Brittany Everts, alleges that her employer, Sushi Brokers, LLC, discriminated against her based on her pregnancy by terminating her employment.

To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the plaintiff must show that she was qualified for the job, was subjected to an adverse employment action, and was replaced by someone who is not similarly situated. The plaintiff has presented evidence that she was a qualified server at the restaurant and was terminated without cause.

The defendant argues that it has a legitimate reason for terminating the plaintiff's employment, citing concerns for the safety of her unborn fetus. However, the court has held that concerns for the safety of an unborn fetus are not sufficient to establish sex as a BFOQ. In Johnson Controls, the Supreme Court held that a company's fetal-protection policy is sex discrimination forbidden under Title VII, and that sex was not a BFOQ in that case. 499 U.S. at 200, 206, 111 S.Ct. 1196.

Furthermore, the court has held that an employer must demonstrate that sex is a BFOQ reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the business or enterprise. 472 U.S. 400. The defendant has failed to present evidence that sex is a BFOQ in this case.

In conclusion, the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of pregnancy discrimination under Title VII. The defendant's legitimate reason for terminating the plaintiff's employment, concerns for the safety of her unborn fetus, is not sufficient to establish sex as a BFOQ. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on her Title VII claim.

gold_text: Sex'"can be a BFOQ in very limited situations. The Supreme Court held that an employer’s concerns for the physical safety of its clientele may qualify sex as a BFOQ. See Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 334-35, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977) (reasoning that employing women as prison guards—in a maximum-security prison where an estimated 20% of the male prisoners were sex offenders scattered throughout the prison’s dormitory facility—could pose a threat to the basic control of the. penitentiary and the protection of the inmates and. other security personnel). However, courts can only consider the safety of third parties -in the BFOQ analysis if those third parties are indispensable to the “essence of the business.” Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell, 472 U.S. 400, 420-21, 105 S.Ct. 2743, 86 L.Ed.2d 321 (1985); see also Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at 203-204, 111 S.Ct. 1196 (rejecting the company’s BFOQ defense in regards to a policy that excludes pregnant workers, in part, because'fetuses are not customers or third parties whose safety is essential to the company’s business).
