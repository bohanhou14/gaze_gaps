We find this lack of narrow tailoring problematic, particularly in light of precedent addressing similar scenarios. In McKaskle, the Court emphasized the necessity of limiting restrictions to avoid overreach — echoing the scenario here where the removal of the entire Website, rather than specific prejudicial content, overreaches. See 682 F.3d 400.

Moreover, our reasoning aligns with the principles established in Salts v. Epps, where an unreasonable determination of the facts similarly warranted reversal. The record here, akin to Salts, is inadequate to substantiate the wholesale restraint imposed on the Officers’ Website. The district court's actions, therefore, represent an unreasonable determination of facts under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2). It underscores the importance of clear, evidence-based justifications for such extensive restrictions.

Given these considerations, we can conclude that the order, as it pertains to the removal of the entire Website, must be vacated. The district court is instructed to reevaluate the necessity and scope of the restraint and ensure that any restrictions are narrowly tailored to address specific prejudicial content without infringing excessively on the Officers' First Amendment rights.

Therefore, we VACATE the district court’s order mandating the removal of the Website in its entirety and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

gold_text: In sum, the district court erred in concluding that the entirety of the Website was substantially likely to cause prejudice. Accordingly, the court’s determination that the entire Website “demonstrate^] a substantial likelihood of impacting the jury venire,” is overbroad and clearly erroneous. See Canal Ins. Co. v. Thornton, 279 F.2d 41, 43 (5th Cir.1960) (concluding that a district court’s determination was clearly erroneous when “there was no basis [in] the record” to support its finding); cf. Batchelor v. Cain, 682 F.3d 400, 413 (5th Cir.2012) (concluding that the state appellate court made an erroneous factual determination that a habeas petitioner waived his request to represent himself when “the record admitted] of no basis” to support the finding). As a result, we must vacate the portion of the order requiring the “takedown” of the Website.
