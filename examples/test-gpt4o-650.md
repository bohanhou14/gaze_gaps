**Generation:**

The defendants argue that the patents are invalid for reasons including indefiniteness and lack of invention. In reference to case 106 F.2d 530, this court recognizes that claims of indefiniteness, though challenging, must be scrutinized closely. In the Hydraulic Press case, the patents are detailed enough to demonstrate a clear combination of old elements to achieve a new result. The argument of mere aggregation is defeated by the practical and substantial success achieved by the plaintiff's patented press (106 F.2d 530).

Furthermore, the defendants' contention about prior art and the claim that no opportunity was given to litigate the related patents follows the logic in case 96 F.2d 242. This case specifies that withholding essential litigation elements can affect the court's decision. Here, however, all relevant patents were properly examined, and defendants had ample opportunity to challenge the claims. Thus, plaintiff's patents are not invalidated by these defenses (96 F.2d 242).

In conclusion, Ernst's patents constitute a novel and useful combination, meeting the legal standards for patentability, and the objections raised by defendants do not suffice to invalidate them.

gold_text: Certainly the presses embodying the claims of the two patents in suit have achieved commercial success. More than that, they appear to have accomplished great productive capacity in plants, such as airplane and automobile factories, where speed and volume production is essential. This has been declared to be evidence of persuasive weight to prove invention. Research Products Co. v. Tretolite Co., 9 Cir., 106 F.2d 530. I am aware, of course, that a clear lack of novelty cannot be overcome by such evidence. Celite Corporation v. Dicalite Co.. 9 Cir., 96 F.2d 242. Having in mind the nature of the claims of the two patents, the makeup of the devices embodying the invention, the state of the prior art, and the presumption of validity from the granting of the patents (Radio Corporation v. Radio Laboratories, 293 U. S. 1, 55 S.Ct. 928, 79 L.Ed. 163; J. A. Mohr & Son v Alliance Securities Co., 9 Cir., 14 F.2d 799), I am judicially satisfied that the patents in suit possess the novelty requisite for validity.
