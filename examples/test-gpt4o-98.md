The plaintiff argues that the city's diversion of funds contravenes the established legal principles and statutes governing public utilities and special funds. Governed specifically by section 8008, Rem. & Bal. Code of Wash., which mandates restrictions on how revenues may be allocated to special funds, any deviation from this statutory framework could potentially invalidate the obligations of the special fund. The essentials of maintaining the integrity of specific funds were also underscored in Twichell v. Seattle, 106 Wash. 32, where the court emphasized adherence to statutory provisions ensuring that funds are appropriately allocated and preserved for their intended purposes.

Furthermore, as outlined in 34 S. Ct. 892, federal injunctions to restrain state proceedings are heavily restricted, only permissible in bankruptcy-related cases. Here, the plaintiff's prayer aligns with this principle, reinforcing that the issue of fund integrity is confined to jurisdictional lines, echoing Swift v. Black Panther Oil & Gas Co., 244 F. 20 on the precept of maintaining jurisdictional boundaries. This principle is again validated in the context of federal and state court delineation as noted in 58 L. Ed. 1557, where judicial restraint is critical to avoid jurisdictional conflicts.

Given these precedents and statutory mandates, the plaintiff’s recourse is to ensure compliance within the structured boundaries of section 8008 and related judicial interpretations, avoiding the overreach that could infringe upon the jurisdiction of separate legal entities.
