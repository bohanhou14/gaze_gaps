The appellants argue that the grand-jury selection procedure in the District of North Dakota failed to ensure a fair cross-section of the community as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and as outlined in the Jury Selection Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1861. To establish a prima facie violation, they must demonstrate: (1) the exclusion of a "distinctive" group in the community; (2) that this group's representation in venires is not fair and reasonable in relation to their numbers in the community; and (3) that the underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion (Reference case 995 F.2d 793; Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357, 364).

The Sixth Amendment requires petit juries to reflect a fair cross-section of the community, although not necessarily to mirror the community exactly (Reference case 991 F.2d 489; Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 530). In the case at hand, the appellants did not provide sufficient evidence to show that a distinctive group was systematically excluded from the jury selection process. Courts generally recognize groups such as Hispanics and African-Americans as distinctive (991 F.2d 489; Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482), but the appellants failed to meet the burden of proof required for such a claim.

Ultimately, the appellants' claims regarding the grand-jury selection process do not hold merit, and as such, the district court did not err in refusing to dismiss their indictments. Therefore, we affirm the decisions of the lower court.

In order to establish a violation of the fair cross-section requirement, the defendant must prove: (1) that a distinctive group in the community was excluded; (2) that representation of the group in venires from which juries are selected is unfair and unreasonable in relation to the group’s numbers in the community; and (3) that the underrepresen-tation is due to systematic exclusion of the group.
