27. In determining whether the appellant's confession was properly suppressed, it is paramount to consider both the specific requirements of the Fifth Amendment and the precedents set by other jurisdictions. The Supreme Court in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, reinforced that an individual must be clearly informed of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to counsel during any police interrogation. This principle is mirrored in the Uniform Code of Military Justice and must be adhered to stringently. Moreover, any ambiguity in invoking the right to remain silent requires clarity, as evidenced in Coleman’s case where the suspect’s equivocal statement "I don’t know. But if he said to stop it I don’t want to do what he said not to do" was not considered a clear invocation of his rights (30 F.3d 1420).

28. Reviewing the military judge’s findings, it is evident that appellant's repeated mention of confusion and desire for legal counsel should have halted further interrogation or at least prompted a need for clarification of his intent. However, in this case, Special Agent Dortch proceeded without clear confirmation of appellant’s waiver of rights, potentially undermining the voluntary nature of the confession. As outlined in both reference cases, ensuring clarity and upholding the rights to counsel and silence are fundamental to a lawful interrogation process. Thus, any failure to observe such procedural safeguards, as indicated by the factual findings and the cited case law, would render the obtained confession inadmissible, necessitating our decision to uphold the suppression of the appellant’s statements.

Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). After a suspect knowingly and voluntarily waives his rights, interrogators may continue questioning unless and until a suspect unequivocally requests an attorney. Davis v. United States, — U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994). Similarly, once a suspect waives the right to silence, interrogators may continue questioning unless and until the suspect unequivocally invokes the right to silence. Coleman v. Singletary, 30 F.3d 1420 (11th Cir.1994), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 1801, 131 L.Ed.2d 727 (1995).
