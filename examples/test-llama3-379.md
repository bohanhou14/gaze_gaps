In the context of legal cases, the interpretation of lesser included offenses is a critical aspect of criminal law. The issue of whether an unloaded gun can constitute a dangerous weapon has been debated in various circuits. In the case of 361 F.2d 71, the court held that the trial court properly denied the requested charge for the lesser included offense of simple assault, as the defense did not raise the issue of an unloaded gun being a dangerous weapon.

Similarly, in the case of 382 F.2d 150, the court affirmed the conviction of assault with a dangerous weapon, despite the defendant's claim that the gun was unloaded. The court held that the defendant's defense of no gun at all in his possession fell flat, and he was therefore not entitled to a charge on simple assault.

In the present case, the defendant's defense was that there was no gun at all in his possession. However, the prosecution presented evidence that the defendant had picked up the gun, which was later found to be a dangerous weapon. The court held that the defendant's defense of no gun at all in his possession was rejected by the jury, and therefore, the defendant was not entitled to a charge on simple assault.

In conclusion, the interpretation of lesser included offenses in criminal law is crucial. The cases of 361 F.2d 71 and 382 F.2d 150 demonstrate that the court's decision to deny a charge on simple assault is not automatically reversible error. The court must consider the specific facts of the case and the defendant's defense before making a determination.

gold_text: . We do not, of course, mean to suggest that a defendant in a criminal case is not entitled to submit inconsistent defenses to the jury. Rather, we recognize the rule to be that “a defendant is entitled to an instruction on any issue fairly raised by the evidence, whether or not consistent with the defendant’s testimony or the defense trial theory.” Womack v. United States, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 40, 336 F.2d 959 (1964) (emphasis added). See Broughman v. United States, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 54, 361 F.2d 71 (1966); Young v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 42, 309 F.2d 662 (1962). However, we think the instant case is governed by our analysis in Belton v. United States, 127 U.S.App.D.C. 201, 206-207, 382 F.2d 150, 155-156 (1967). Belton establishes that in order for a lesser included offense instruction to be proper, there must be evidence “fairly tending” to bear on such an offense to the extent that “the trial court will be reasonably alerted to the factual predicate underlying the instruction requested.” 127 U.S.App.D.C. at 207, 382 F.2d at 156. In the words of Belton: “Here the testimony did not ‘fairly tend’ to bear on [simple assault] and we cannot assign reversible error to the failure of the trial court to glean and array on its own motion the strained possibilities of events put forward by counsel who have mulled over the appeal, but not advanced at trial either by defense counsel or the witnesses.” Id.
