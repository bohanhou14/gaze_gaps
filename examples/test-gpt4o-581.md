**Generation:**

This issue was addressed in several precedents. In 100 F.2d 979, it was held that § 57j does not negate a valid and existing lien at the time of adjudication, allowing penalties supported by such liens. Furthermore, 273 F.2d 682 affirmed that tax penalties covered by a pre-bankruptcy lien are "enforced to the extent of the lien." Contrarily, 269 F.2d 719 opined that § 57j bars penalty claims regardless of lien status. The court in 267 F.2d 374 highlighted the divided opinions on the matter but leaned towards recognizing valid liens despite § 57j.

Balancing these views, we note that while § 57j prohibits allowance of penalty claims, a pre-existing lien supporting such penalties prior to bankruptcy remains valid. Therefore, aligning with the opinions in 100 F.2d 979 and 273 F.2d 682, we conclude that the lien claim for penalties should be recognized.

Affirmed.
