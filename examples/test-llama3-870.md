This case involves the dispute over the trademark "Wrist Rocket" used by Wrist-Rocket Manufacturing Company, Inc. (Wrist-Rocket) and Saunders Archery Company (Saunders). The district court held that Saunders had a common law right to use the trademark, and cancelled Wrist-Rocket's registration. Wrist-Rocket appeals, arguing that it had priority of appropriation and use of the trademark in connection with its business.

The court found that Saunders was the first to use the trademark, and was the party with whom the public identified the slingshot. Saunders' use of the trademark was not in conflict with Wrist-Rocket's common law rights, as Wrist-Rocket's use was not prior to Saunders'. The court also found that Wrist-Rocket had not proven that its use of the trademark was superior to Saunders'.

The court ruled that Wrist-Rocket's incontestable registration did not confer upon it rights not possessed at common law. The court cited Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 461 F.2d 1040, where it was held that an incontestable registration does not confer upon the registrant rights not possessed at common law.

The court also found that Saunders' common law right to use the trademark could not destroy the incontestable status of Wrist-Rocket's registration. The court cited Tillamook County Cream. Ass'n v. Tillamook Cheese & D. Ass'n, 233 F.2d 180, where it was held that an incontestable registration is the exception to the rule that conclusive vested rights are not conferred by registration.

In conclusion, the court affirmed the district court's finding that Saunders had a common law right to use the trademark "Wrist Rocket", and cancelled Wrist-Rocket's registration. The court also ordered that the parties use the trademark only in conjunction with a prefix of equal prominence that identifies the source of origin.
