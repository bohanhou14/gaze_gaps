The reference case 495 F.2d 448 highlights the importance of considering the labor actually expended on the client's behalf when determining a fee. Similarly, in 488 F.2d 714, the court emphasized the need to examine the magnitude and complexity of litigation when calculating attorneys' fees.

In the case at hand, the plaintiff, Mrs. Cleary, is a 73-year-old widow who suffers from various health issues and is eligible for Medicaid benefits. However, her resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical care and services. Despite her eligibility, Mrs. Cleary's Medicaid application was incorrectly processed, leading to a discrepancy in her liability. The court found that the defendant's failure to correctly compute Mrs. Cleary's liability violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The parties eventually entered into a consent decree, which resulted in the defendant agreeing to correctly compute the plaintiff's eligibility for Medicaid benefits and the amount of benefits to which she is entitled. The court held that Mrs. Cleary is a "prevailing party" within the meaning of the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees.

In calculating the attorneys' fees, the court considered the time and labor expended, counsels' experience, the magnitude and complexity of litigation, the amount recovered, and awards in similar cases. The court awarded a total of $3,951.92 in attorneys' fees, which is a reasonable and fair amount considering the complexity of the case and the experience of the attorneys involved.

gold_text: Schwartz claims compensation for 30.75 hours of work on the case and the attorneys’ fees issue. Glaberson claims compensation for 66.25 hours and Reixach claims 3 hours. The Second Circuit has instructed district courts passing on fee applications to scrutinize them with an “eye to moderation.” City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448, 470 (2d Cir. 1974) With this admonishment in mind, I exclude from the total compensable hours 7.5 of the 15 hours worked by Schwartz on the attorneys’ fees issue, .5 of the hour Schwartz claims for reviewing a four-page discovery request and 10 of the 66.1 hours Glaberson worked on the case because the time claimed for these activities is unreasonably high. Most attorneys would not have spent so many hours on these issues. See Gagne v. Maher, 455 F.Supp. 1344, 1349 (2d Cir. 1978). I also subtract the 5.3 hours Glaberson spent de livering and filing papers, a task which could have been accomplished by a non-lawyer at a much lower rate. See Johnson v. Georgia Highway, 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974). I further disallow 2.5 of the 5 hours Schwartz spent researching the complaint because it was duplicative of work performed by Glaberson. Id. at 717. Finally, due to Ms. Reixach’s failure to keep current and accurate time records despite repeated admonitions by the Second Circuit on the import of doing so, I must exclude IV2 of the 3 hours claimed by Ms. Reixach.
