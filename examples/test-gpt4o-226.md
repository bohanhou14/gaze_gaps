In addition, appellants argue that the violation of the act was not wilful, contending they lacked the necessary criminal intent. However, this argument is without merit. As established in Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fé Railway Company v. United States, 170 F. 256, ignorance of the tariff rates does not absolve responsibility, as carriers are presumed to know their own published rates (ref. 187 F. 363). 

Moreover, the principle that wilfulness in this context does not require an evil intent but rather the intentional doing of an act forbidden by statute is well documented. This is supported by the Supreme Court’s ruling in Armour Packing Co. v. United States, 209 U.S. 56, 85-86, where it was held that knowingly committing an act prohibited by law suffices to establish wilfulness under the Elkins Act (ref. 98 U.S. 145). Consequently, the carriers' knowledge of the essential facts that mandated the interstate rate and their failure to apply it correctly constitutes a wilful violation.

The case at hand is an instance where the appellants had clear notice from shipping documents indicating the interstate nature of the shipment yet proceeded to apply an incorrect rate, thus conclusively fulfilling the criteria for a wilful statutory violation under the Elkins Act.
