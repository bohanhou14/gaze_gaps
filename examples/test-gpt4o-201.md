**Generation:**

Our analysis of the present case is further supported by the precedent set forth in the aforementioned references. In reference case 536 F.3d 215, the Bankruptcy Court held that Mullarkey's claims were barred by doctrines including res judicata and collateral estoppel, emphasizing that all arguments had been previously litigated. This principle of preventing litigation of previously decided issues is consistent with denying McKenna's claims as duplicative.

Similarly, the protocol in reference case 226 F.3d 133 illustrates the handling of duplicative suits. When faced with such scenarios, courts may dismiss the second suit without prejudice or consolidate the actions, ensuring that plaintiffs do not have dual opportunities to litigate the same subject matter.

Therefore, the District Court's reliance on Walton was appropriate to prevent McKenna from circumventing amendment rules and expanding procedural rights unjustly. Consequently, the District Court's dismissal of McKenna II serves to uphold the integrity of judicial processes by avoiding repetitive and vexatious litigation.

However, his attempt to resume or replead the § 1983-First Amendment claim would have been thwarted by res judicata, which prohibits relitigation of claims that have been, or could have been, decided on the merits. Mullarkey v. Tamboer, 536 F.3d 215, 225 (3d Cir.2008). For res judicata purposes, “denial of a motion to amend a complaint in one action is a final judgment on the merits barring the same complaint in a later action.” Prof. Mgmt. Assoc. Inc. v.
