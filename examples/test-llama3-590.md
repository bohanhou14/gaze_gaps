In this legal case, the court is asked to review the remedies provided to a veteran, Ellis Brumbaugh, under the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA). The court has already ruled on the issue of reinstatement and backpay, and now turns to the issue of additional remedies.

The court notes that under USERRA, a veteran is entitled to all of the "rights and benefits" of employment, including clothing allowances. The court cites reference cases 589 F.2d 935 and 167 F.2d 175, which support the expansive interpretation of "benefits" under USERRA.

The court also examines the issue of liquidated damages, which is a provision of USERRA that allows for an award of damages for a willful violation of the Act. The court holds that the defendant's failure to rehire Brumbaugh as a detective was not willful, citing reference case 600 F.2d 1070, which defines "willful" as conduct known to be prohibited or engaged in with reckless disregard of its prohibition.

Finally, the court addresses the issue of pension benefits, citing reference case 804 F.2d 821, which supports the idea that a veteran is entitled to credit for their military service towards their civilian pension.

In conclusion, the court has ruled in favor of Brumbaugh on all of the issues presented, awarding him reinstatement, backpay, a clothing allowance, and credits towards his pension benefits. The court's decision is based on its interpretation of USERRA and the case law supporting its provisions.
