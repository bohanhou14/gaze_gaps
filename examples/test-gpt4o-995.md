Moreover, the principles outlined in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961), reaffirm that a violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for unlawful arrest necessitates showing that the officer lacked probable cause. In this context, Trooper Thompson failed to demonstrate probable cause that either plaintiff committed a crime as required by Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89 (1964). 

The case also brings into consideration the doctrine from 347 U.S. 128, which emphasizes caution in applying federal reversal standards to state procedures before states have had the opportunity to adapt to evolving legal standards. Given that plaintiffs' right to be free from unlawful arrest was clearly established, the evidence did not support Thompson's claim of probable cause, making their arrests unjustifiable.

Additionally, the court must consider the role of mitigating circumstances in the defendant's actions. Similar to the case of Patterson under New York's statute, as seen in 432 U.S. 197, the burden sufficiently falls on the state to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the arrest was warranted. Here, no such burden was met, and thus, the plaintiffs' resistance to unlawful arrest remains justified.

Thus, based on these precedents, it is clear that Trooper Thompson did not meet the standards for probable cause, confirming that the plaintiffs' arrests were unlawful under ยง 1983 claims.

Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). A person arrested without probable cause has been deprived of a right under the Constitution and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 provides him a means for redress. Accordingly, the court finds that both plaintiffs have established their right to recover from the defendant under ยง 1983.
