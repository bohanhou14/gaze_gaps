C. Adequacy of the Search

Plaintiff also challenges the adequacy of the FBI's search for responsive records. The adequacy of an agency’s search for requested documents is judged by a standard of reasonableness, i.e., “the agency must show beyond material doubt... that it has conducted a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.” Weisberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 705 F.2d 1344, 1351 (D.C.Cir.1983). This does not mean the search has to be exhaustive, but it should be thorough and in good faith as evidenced by detailed and nonconclusory affidavits (71 F.3d 885, 779 F.2d 1378).

In the present case, the FBI's declarations must demonstrate that the agency’s search efforts were reasonably calculated to identify the records Coldiron requested. However, if the agency has not adequately explained what files might contain the requested information, its search cannot be deemed adequate. (71 F.3d 885).

If the agency provides a reasonable explanation of its methodology and the files searched, and these assertions are made in good faith, then the search is likely deemed adequate despite potential gaps (779 F.2d 1378). The FBI's declaration in this case indicates compliance with these requirements, following established standards, and providing sufficient details in their affidavits (Goland v. CIA, 607 F.2d 339, 352 (D.C.Cir.1978)).

Given that the FBI's explanations concerning the search are relatively detailed and submitted in good faith, we find their search efforts to be adequate. Therefore, the court must grant the FBI's summary judgment motion regarding the adequacy of the search.

Coldiron attempts to reserve the right to contest the sufficiency of the FBI’s search: "To the extent that these documents [that might explain why the INS suspended Coldiron’s security clearance] have not been discovered through their search, Ms [sic] Col-diron contends that the search may have been inadequate.” See id. However, the FBI need only demonstrate that its search was reasonable, not that it retrievéd all responsive documents. See Nation Magazine v. U.S. Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885; 892 n. 7 (D.C.Cir.1995); Miller v. U.S. Dep't of State, 779 F.2d 1378, 1383 (8th Cir.1985). According to this standard, FBI’s search was adequate.. See Kiefer Decl. at 5-10 (describing in detail the Central Récord System used to find any FBI records on Coldiron).
