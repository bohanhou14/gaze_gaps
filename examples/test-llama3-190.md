Based on the reference cases, it is evident that the regulation of adult businesses must be tailored to the justification for the regulation. In the case of New Albany DVD, the City of New Albany enacted a zoning ordinance that prohibited the operation of an adult bookstore near a church or residential area. The ordinance was challenged as unconstitutional, citing the First Amendment.

The court noted that the ordinance was based on the content or subject matter of the books and videos sold, which is a violation of the First Amendment. The court also found that the ordinance was not narrowly tailored to the City's justification, as it prohibited the operation of adult bookstores in areas where there was no evidence of adverse secondary effects.

In reference to the case 308 U.S. 147, the court noted that the ordinance was overly broad and did not leave sufficient alternative channels of communication for the expression of ideas. In reference to the case 466 U.S. 789, the court noted that the ordinance was not based on a sufficient factual record to support the City's justification.

In reference to the case 368 F.3d 1186, the court noted that the ordinance was not narrowly tailored to the City's justification and that it was not supported by a sufficient factual record. The court also noted that the ordinance was overly broad and did not leave sufficient alternative channels of communication for the expression of ideas.

In conclusion, the ordinance enacted by the City of New Albany is unconstitutional and violates the First Amendment. The ordinance is overly broad and does not leave sufficient alternative channels of communication for the expression of ideas. The court finds that the City must provide a more specific justification for the regulation and that the regulation must be narrowly tailored to the City's justification.

gold_text: Pornographic litter is the City’s other principal basis. The printed word often is tossed away, but litter-control justifications have fared poorly as reasons to regulate pamphlets and other written materials. Compare Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 60 S.Ct. 146, 84 L.Ed. 155 (1939), with Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 808-10, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984). Perhaps smutty litter should be judged by different standards, but first it is necessary to know how serious the problem is. That one pedodontist in Spokane complained about litter from one bookstore, see World Wide Video of Washington, Inc. v. Spokane, 368 F.3d 1186, 1197 (9th Cir.2004), does not do much to establish that this is a serious problem in New Albany (or even in Spokane). The volume of complaints exceeds the number of genuine problems. There are thousands of adult bookstores; it should be easy to find out how much litter they generate, how much of this litter falls into the hands of minors, and whether this is a materially greater problem when one store carries 40% adult books than when lots of stores carry 10% apiece. (Many a convenience store, newsstand, or video rental outlet has an adult nook, which escapes regulation under New Albany’s statute.) Plaintiff has been in operation for a while now; is sexually themed litter a problem near its store?
