CHASE, Circuit Judge.
In addressing the issue of infringement and unfair competition, the prevailing principle is that a trade-mark encompasses the exclusive right to use a particular symbol in a way that distinguishes one's goods from those of others, as affirmed in Industrial Rayon Corp. v. Dutchess Underwear Corp., 2 Cir., 92 F.2d 33, and Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403. The reference case 247 F. 407 emphasizes that even if the goods are of a different nature, the use of a similar mark might still lead to consumer confusion regarding the source, this principle also firmly applies here. The defendant's use of "V-8" on vitamin tablets, while the plaintiff's use is on vegetable juices, bears significant resemblance and can confuse the public about the product's origin. Likewise, as per the stance in 300 F. 509, where the dominant feature of the mark can lead to a perception of an unfair advantage, the defendant's use of "V-8" over a red disc makes it the distinctive element of the mark, mimicking the plaintiffâ€™s well-known product mark thereby constituting unfair competition. The essence, as in the related cause of action for unfair competition, lies in possible public misperception about the product's source, rather than the product type itself, thus justifying the judgment and injunction granted by the lower court.

gold_text: The protection which the law gives the owner of a trade-mark is not confined to the goods upon which it is, or has been, used by the owner of it but extends to products which would be reasonably thought by the buying public to come from the same source if sold under the same mark. Aunt Jemima Mills Co. v. Rigney & Co., 2 Cir., 247 F. 407, L.R.A. 1918C, 1039; Vogue Co. v. Thompson-Hudson Co., 6 Cir., 300 F. 509; Wall v. Rolls-Royce of America, Inc., 3 Cir., 4 F.2d 333. His mark is the brand by which his goods can be identified, and when it is used by another the reputation of his mark, and consequently his own business reputation, are placed to that extent beyond his control. Unless the use by that other is upon goods so unlike his own or in territory so far from that which he has exploited that it will not create confusion, it will be enjoined. Yale Electric Corp. v. Robertson, 2 Cir., 26 F.2d 972; L. E. Waterman Co. v. Gordon, 2 Cir., 72 F.2d 272.
