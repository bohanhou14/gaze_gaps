In the case of a 10-year-old's birthday party, planning a treasure hunt can be an exciting and engaging activity for the kids. Similarly, in the legal case of Eifert v. Ford Motor Company, the court had to navigate the complexities of a privilege log to determine the adequacy of the documents withheld by Ford.

The court in Eifert v. Ford Motor Company emphasized the importance of a privilege log in providing sufficient information about the nature of the withheld documents, so that the receiving party can assess the validity of the privilege claim. In this case, Ford's privilege log was deemed insufficient because it failed to provide concrete facts about the nature or subject matter of the withheld documents.

Similarly, in United States v. Constr. Prods. Research, Inc., the Second Circuit held that a privilege log was insufficient where the log contained a general claim of attorney-client privilege accompanied by the listed documents' dates, authors, recipients, and "cursory" descriptions. Similarly, in R.J. Reynolds Tobacco v. Philip Morris, Inc., the Third Circuit determined that a privilege log was inadequate where the description of the documents included "various daily log entries," "interoffice emails," or various miscellaneous "notes/correspondence."

In contrast, other federal courts have found privilege logs to be sufficiently detailed where the logs contained the privilege asserted for each document along with the document date, author, recipient, type, and a description. For example, in Spilker v. Medtronic, Inc., the court found that a privilege log was sufficient where the log contained a description such as "email string containing confidential communications with outside counsel and in-house counsel regarding employee benefits and labor issues in [named] transactions."

In conclusion, the court's decision in Eifert v. Ford Motor Company highlights the importance of a privilege log in providing sufficient information about the nature of the withheld documents. A well-crafted privilege log can help to ensure that the receiving party can assess the validity of the privilege claim and avoid unnecessary disputes. By following the guidelines set forth in the case law, parties can create a privilege log that is both adequate and effective.

gold_text: Moreover, as Plaintiffs point out, many of the withheld documents were created by non-attorneys within Ford’s ASO, and then sent to attorneys within Ford’s OGC. Mr. Ott testified to his belief that he and his team were assigned to perform the 2010 investigation into unintended acceleration as part of the normal course of Ford’s business. (ECF No. 569-1 at 5); see Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co., 967 F.2d 980, 984 (4th Cir.1992) (noting that materials prepared in ordinary course of business “are not documents prepared in anticipation of litigation”); Johnson v. Ford Motor Co., No. 3:13-cv-06529, 2015 WL 1650428, at *4 (S.D.W.Va. Apr. 14, 2015) (recognizing that, under both West Virginia and Michigan law, not all communications between attorney and client are privileged, only those made for purpose of obtaining legal advice); Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd, 306 F.R.D. 234 (N.D.Cal. 2015) (noting that simply because an attorney is involved in a communication does not make the communication privileged, nor does a single email of a legal nature “privilege the entire email thread.”). Obviously then, reasonable questions exist as to Ford’s claims of attorney-client privilege and work-product protection in light of the plain facial inadequacy of the privilege log and Mr. Ott’s testimony. Ford should have recognized these issues and answered them with a more detailed privilege log or some type of extrinsic evidence further explaining the basis for withholding the listed ASO documents before Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to compel. Even now, Mr. Logel’s affidavit does not entirely quell Plaintiffs’ reasonable skepticism as to the nondisclosure of some of the listed documents; particularly, in light of Mr. Ott’s testimony. Therefore, after having reviewed the May 2015 supplemental ASO privilege log, the Court FINDS that the log’s document descriptions do not enable Plaintiffs “to make an intelligent determination about the validity of the assertion of the privilege” and thus are insufficient. Auto. Club of N.Y., Inc., 2014 WL 2518959, at *5.
