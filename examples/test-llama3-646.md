Here is the case that I have written so far:

GRUENDER, Circuit Judge.

Rosa Mercedes De Castro-Gutierrez, a native and citizen of Colombia, petitions for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”), affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge (“IJ”) to deny her claims for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”).

De Castro-Gutierrez entered the United States on August 17, 2004, as a non-immigrant B-2 visitor with authorization to remain until February 16, 2005. She remained in the United States after that date without authorization.

To qualify for withholding of removal, De Castro-Gutierrez must show that there is “a clear probability that [her] ‘life or freedom would be threatened in [Colombia] because of [her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.’” Mom-pongo v. Gonzales, 406 F.3d 512, 514 (8th Cir.2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A)). Persecution is an extreme concept, involving “the infliction or threat of death, torture, or injury to one’s person or freedom.” Regalado-Garcia v. INS, 305 F.3d 784, 787 (8th Cir.2002).

The IJ and BIA correctly concluded that De Castro-Gutierrez had not suffered past persecution that would entitle her to a presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(ii). The alleged incidents of persecution directed at De Castro-Gutierrez consist of receiving threatening phone calls, once being threatened in person, and once being robbed at gunpoint. Substantial evidence supports the conclusion that these incidents do not rise to the level of persecution, even when considered cumulatively. See Uli v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 950, 955 (8th Cir.2008) (“Low-level intimidation and harassment alone do not rise to the level of persecution.” (quoting Makatengkeng v. Gonzales, 495 F.3d 876, 882 (8th Cir.2007))).

citations: ['427 F.3d 1077', '556 F.3d 658']

gold_text: To be entitled to protection under the CAT, an alien must establish that it is “more likely than not that ... she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2). “Torture is defined narrowly as an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment intentionally inflicted by or with the acquiescence of a person acting in an official capacity.” Sheikh v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 1077, 1082 (8th Cir.2005). De Castro-Gutierrez’s CAT claim is based on the same evidence as her withholding of removal claim. We therefore conclude that De Castro-Gutierrez has failed to establish that she is entitled to relief under the CAT. See Clemente-Giron v. Holder, 556 F.3d 658, 662 (8th Cir.2009) (“If the applicant’s CAT claim relies on the same evidence as her ... withholding of removal claim[], the court’s adverse deci sion on ... withholding of .removal will also be determinative of the CAT claim.”).
