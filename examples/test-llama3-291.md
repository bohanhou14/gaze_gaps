In the context of legal cases, the reference articles provided offer valuable insights into the complexities of patent law and intellectual property rights. The cases cited, such as 14 Wall. 511, 81 U.S. 511, 76 F.3d 1185, and 286 F.2d 596, demonstrate the importance of understanding the nuances of patent infringement and unfair competition.

In the case of Moen International v. Foremost International Trading, Inc., the court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of Moen, citing the likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, and the balance of hardships. The court concluded that Foremost's faucet design was substantially the same as Moen's patented design, and that Moen would suffer irreparable harm if an injunction were not granted.

The reference cases cited, such as Gorham Mfg. Co. v. White, 81 U.S. (14 Wall.) 511, 528, 20 L.Ed 731 (1871), and Payless Shoesource, Inc. v. Reebok Int'l Ltd., 998 F.2d 985, 988 (Fed.Cir.1993), provide guidance on the standards for design patent infringement and the importance of considering the point of novelty in a claimed design.

Furthermore, the case of West Bend's Patent v. Presto, 76 F.3d 1185, illustrates the concept that the grant of a separate patent on the accused device does not automatically avoid infringement, either literal or by equivalency. This highlights the need for careful consideration of the accused device's features and whether they infringe upon the patented design.

In conclusion, the reference articles provided offer valuable insights into the complexities of patent law and intellectual property rights. By examining the cases cited, including 14 Wall. 511, 81 U.S. 511, 76 F.3d 1185, and 286 F.2d 596, lawyers and scholars can gain a deeper understanding of the nuances of patent infringement and unfair competition.

With respect to this argument, as stated, Foremost presents no authority that a subsequently issued design patent on an accused product precludes infringement of a previously issued design patent. Moen, on the other hand, notes that in the seminal design patent case Gorham Mfg. Co. v. White, 14 Wall. 511, 81 U.S. 511, 528, 20 L.Ed. 731 (1871), the infringer had two design patents on the accused product, and the Supreme Court, nonetheless, held that the accused product infringed the earlier issued Gorham patent. In addition, with respect to utility patents, Moen notes that the Federal Circuit has stated that "[t]he grant of a separate patent on the accused device does not automatically avoid infringement, either literally or by equivalency.” National Presto Indus., Inc. v. West Bend Co., 76 F.3d 1185, 1191 (Fed.Cir.1996). See also Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. v. Sandee Mfg. Co., 126 U.S.P.Q. 32, 35 (N.D.Ill.), rev’d on other grounds, 286 F.2d 596 (7th Cir.1960). In light of the above, this court cannot find that the issuance of a subsequent design patent on an aspect of an accused product precludes infringement of a previously issued design patent:
