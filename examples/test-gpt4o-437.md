In essence, the core issue is whether the Commissioner correctly deducted the declared dividend from the plaintiff's invested capital as of January 25, 1918. Here, the interpretation of the dividend resolution and pertinent regulations take precedence. Utilizing the precedent set in Swift & Company v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, it can be argued that the Commissioner was within his rights to enforce compliance as per the regulations established (26 S. Ct. 272, 50 L. Ed. 515). This is also supported by the broader principle that regulated entities must operate within statutory bounds to ensure consistency and fairness in enforcement (27 S. Ct. 695, 51 L. Ed. 1143). 

Therefore, it is clear that the dividend declarations align with Article 858 and the applicable Treasury regulations, leading to a justified reduction of the plaintiff's invested capital. Plaintiffâ€™s stance, arguing misinterpretation by the Commissioner, fails to hold under the scrutiny of both regulatory framework and established legal precedents.

gold_text: Notice of this -contention of plaintiff is supererogation because our decision is not based upon payment of the dividend on January 31,1918. Our examination of the dividend resolution has satisfied us that the Commissioner was correct in his interpretation of it, and that the withdrawal of invested capital was properly declared as of January 25, 1918, pursuant to article 858 of Regulations 45. The validity of that regulation is not open to serious question, in our judgment. It was promulgated by authority of Congress, and since its publication it has set forth the interpretation and practice of the Treasury Department in respect to several sections of the act of 1918, and, as such, it is entitled to great consideration. This is true of any regulation adopted pursuant to an act which placed the duty of enforcement of it upon the department making the regulation; but this particular regulation is entitled to even greater weight than an ordinary one, because Congress has several times re-enacted the provisions of the sections of the act of 1918 which the regulation was designed to interpret, and, under such circumstances, it has the implied sanction of that body. This is an established rule of construction. See New Haven R. R. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 200 U. S. 361, 26 S. Ct. 272, 50 L. Ed. 515; Copper Queen v. Arizona, 206 U. S. 474, 27 S. Ct. 695, 51 L. Ed. 1143.
