The decision regarding the foreclosure and sale of the mining company's property follows well-established principles of equity. The court's approach is consistent with the principle articulated in National Foundry & Pipe Works v. Oconto Water Co., 52 F. 43, where it was held that a judicial sale must treat the plant and franchise as an entirety to avoid destruction of value. Moreover, as affirmed in Pacific Northwest Packing Co. v. Allen, 116 F. 312, the necessity of selling property as one parcel when dividing it would impair its value was upheld.

The court's decision to sell the property without redemption is supported by the ruling in 208 F. 976, which emphasized that to preserve public and private interests, properties and their associated franchises should be sold as a whole. This principle ensures that the estate is treated equitably and prevents the sacrifice of significant value that comes with segregated sales. 

Therefore, the judgments and orders of the foreclosure and subsequent sale are in harmony with these precedents, ensuring equity is served by maintaining the integrity and value of the mining property.

gold_text: The trial court, after hearing evidence as to the proper method of sale of the property, came to the conclusion that, unless the property was sold as a unit and without the right of redemption, it would not or might not pay the expenses of the receivership, including the receiver’s certificate. The plaintiff corporation, the trustee named in the mortgage, and the defendant mining company, agreed to the order directing the sale without the right of redemption. This agreement followed the terms of the mortgage which so provided. The period of redemption under the Nevada law for real estate sold in pursuance of a mortgage foreclosure is six months, and it is estimated that the net cost of protecting the property during that period, without further mining or development work, would be over $180,000. The proposed bidder, Mr. Cole, testified, as above stated, that he would not bid on the property if it was sold with- a right of redemption, nor bid upon it if the personal and real property were separated. It has been held that sales of similar personal and real property covered by a single mortgage could be so made regardless of the state statute permitting redemption. National Foundry, etc., Co. v. Oconto Water Co. (C. C.) 52 F. 43; Cont. & C. T. & S. Bank v. Corey Bros. Const. Co. (C. C. A.) 208 F. 976, 984; Pac. N. W. Pkg. Co. v. Allen (C. C. A.) 116 F. 312; Title Ins. & Trust Co. v. Calif. Dev. Co., 171 Cal. 173, 152 P. 542, 555; Fletcher on Corporations, vol. 3, p. 2372, § 1388. It is claimed that these cases are peculiarly applicable to mining property in Nevada where such mining is declared to be a public use. Stat. Nev. 1887, p. 102, Revised Laws of Nevada, § 2456. Whether such a sale could be so made without the consent of the mining company is a point we need not determine, for the reason that we here have that consent expressed both before and after the order, and the only question necessary for our determination is whether the intervener can successfully invoke the. power of the court to overturn the determination of the board of directors and of the counsel representing the corporation by invoking the court’s authority to protect the corporation, notwithstanding the action of the corporation through its duly appointed officers. Instead of that, the court, after fully hearing all parties, including the intervener, approved the action of the directors and ordered the sale without redemption as agreed by the directors of the corporation. The court therefore had announced its conclusion that the basis on which the intervener sought to invoke the powers of the court was not well founded, but nevertheless did give full opportunity to the intervener to be heard as to the advisability of such a sale, and decided that equity and justice required the property to be so sold. The intervener made no claim that he would bid, or that any other bid than that of Cole could be reasonably anticipated. He was asking a court of equity to adopt a course which would wreck the mining property, destroy the security of the bondholders, and leave them without adequate remedy, and ignore the obligations of the receiver by a course of action that might result in a total loss to all concerned. The court was fully justified in acting upon the •consent of the corporation and in ignoring or overruling the intervener’s opposition to such a sale. The fact is, as the sale demonstrated, that the mine is worthless except as a speculation, and that no one was willing to speculate upon the property other than those who were already so deeply involved that it was necessary for them to go forward in an effort to protect themselves in the expenditures already made.
