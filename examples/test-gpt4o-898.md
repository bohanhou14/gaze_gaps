The Supreme Court has articulated clear frameworks for addressing claims of discrimination and retaliatory actions in employment. In Mt. Healthy Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), the Court held that once an employee demonstrates that their constitutionally protected conduct played a substantial role in the employer's adverse decision, the burden shifts to the employer to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the same decision would have been made absent the protected conduct (439 U.S. 410). The defendants in this case have failed to meet this burden. Their reasons for dismissing Dr. Vargas, ostensibly to address departmental personality conflicts, are undermined by their appointment of Dr. Martinez Maldonado, who had a history of tension and minimal commitment to the Department of Physiology.

Further, as established in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977), proving discriminatory intent requires a sensitive inquiry into both direct and circumstantial evidence. In this case, the incidents including Dr. Martinez Maldonado's inflammatory remarks about non-native Puerto Rican professors and subsequent posters calling for their expulsion present a clear pattern of discriminatory intent based on national origin (429 U.S. 252). This evidence reveals that the defendants' actions were not mere arbitrations but motivated by invidious discrimination.

Given these findings, it's evident that Dr. Vargas has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, justifying the granting of preliminary injunctive relief. The protection of his constitutional rights outweighs any potential harm to the defendants, and reinstating Dr. Vargas serves the public interest by upholding principles of fairness and academic integrity.
