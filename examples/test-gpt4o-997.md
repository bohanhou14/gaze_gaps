**Generation:**

In evaluating the petitioner's proportionality claim, it is necessary to consider precedents set by higher courts. The Supreme Court has held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishments that are "grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime." (433 U.S. 584; Gregg v. Georgia). Furthermore, the concept of "narrow proportionality" has been endorsed, where only extreme disparities between crime and punishment offend the Eighth Amendment (941 F.2d 419; Harmelin v. Michigan). 

The petitioner's claim that his twenty to forty-year sentence for conspiracy to commit armed robbery is disproportionate under these precedents lacks merit because the sentencing court's decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and it considered relevant factors like criminal history and the serious nature of the offense (268 F.3d 417; Proffitt v. Florida). Therefore, even under an independent de novo review standard, the petitioner has not demonstrated that his sentence constitutes an extreme case of disproportionate punishment violating the Eighth Amendment.

Accordingly, the proportionality claim does not provide grounds for federal habeas relief.

gold_text: A plurality of the Supreme Court has held that the Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality between the crime and sentence. See Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 965, 111 S.Ct. 2680. As the Supreme Court observed in Lockyer, it is generally recognized after Harmelin that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment forbids only an extreme disparity between crime and sentence, that is, sentences that are “grossly disproportionate” to the crime.
