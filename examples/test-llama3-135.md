The references provided are cases that involve legal issues and discussions. Case 636 F.3d 168 discusses the issue of a missing witness instruction in a trial. The court denied the defendant's request for an instruction, citing the defendant's knowledge of the witness's intentions to take the Fifth Amendment. The court's decision was upheld on appeal.

Case 709 F.3d 413 discusses the issue of a statute of limitations in a conspiracy to defraud the United States case. The defendant argued that the six-year statute of limitations applied, while the government argued that the five-year statute of limitations applied. The court ultimately found that the six-year statute of limitations applied to the offense, citing the object of the conspiracy as the attempt to evade or defeat any tax or the payment thereof.

In the context of the provided case, the issue of a missing witness instruction may arise if a key witness fails to testify or is unavailable to testify. In such a situation, the court may need to consider whether to give an instruction to the jury regarding the missing witness. However, as seen in Case 636 F.3d 168, the court's decision in this regard is reviewed for abuse of discretion.

The issue of a statute of limitations may also arise in this case, particularly if the defendant argues that the five-year statute of limitations applies. However, as seen in Case 709 F.3d 413, the court's decision in this regard is also reviewed for abuse of discretion.

In conclusion, the references provided offer valuable insights into legal issues and discussions. They highlight the importance of considering the context and circumstances of each case when interpreting legal principles. In the context of the provided case, the court may need to consider the issues of a missing witness instruction and a statute of limitations when making its decision. However, the court's decision in these regards is reviewed for abuse of discretion.

gold_text: Fourth, Lockett argues that the district court erred in refusing his proposed instruction distinguishing between acts of omission that would not support a felony conviction for income tax evasion and acts of commission that would. We review the district court’s exclusion of Lockett’s requested instruction “under an abuse of discretion standard, affording the trial court substantial latitude in describing the law to the jurors.” United States v. Rios, 636 F.3d 168, 171 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Reversal based on a district court’s refusal to give a jury instruction “is not warranted unless the proposed instruction (1) is substantially correct, (2) is not substantively covered in the jury charge, and (3) pertains to an important issue in the trial, such that failure to give it seriously impairs the presentation of an effective defense.” United States v.
