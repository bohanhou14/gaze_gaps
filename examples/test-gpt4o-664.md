**Generation:**

Plaintiffs argue that the precedents set in earlier cases should allow for broader interpretation of the "in connection with the purchase or sale" requirement under Section 10(b). However, as emphasized in 486 F.2d 139, the scope of this requirement remains firm, restricting actions to defrauded purchasers or sellers directly involved in the transaction. This precedent aligns with our rejection of plaintiffs' contention that mere internal corporate decisions or shareholder votes on restructuring equate to a purchase or sale under Section 10(b).

Furthermore, in 490 F.2d 654, the court extended protections to investors impacted by securities fraud even if they were not direct purchasers or sellers. However, the distinctive factor in that case was the direct impact of fraud on the plaintiffs' investment interests and personal guarantees. In contrast, plaintiffs here fail to demonstrate such direct fraudulent impact vis-à-vis their shareholder status and internal restructuring.

Given these precedents, the court affirms the dismissal of the Section 10(b) claims. The district court's denial of an implied private right of action under Section 13(a) is also supported by 486 F.2d 139, ensuring consistency with the necessity of the purchaser-seller requirement under Section 18(a) for standing. Therefore, summary judgment on these claims is upheld.

General Motors Acceptance Corp., 490 F.2d 654 (7th Cir. 1973). In Eason, plaintiff shareholders had personally guaranteed liabilities of their corporation given in connection with the corporation’s purchase of a business. When the business failed and the corporation went bankrupt, plaintiffs were held to have a 10(b) cause of action for fraud against the seller of the business.
