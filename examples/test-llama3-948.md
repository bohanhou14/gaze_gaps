In the context of a malicious prosecution claim, the issue of probable cause is a crucial element. As stated in Robinson v. White, 90 Idaho 548, 414 P.2d 666 (1966), lack of probable cause is an essential element in an action for malicious prosecution. In the case at hand, Trooper Neil issued traffic citations to the plaintiffs and they were subsequently convicted by the District Justice. Although the convictions were later reversed upon a trial de novo by the Court of Common Pleas, the summary convictions are sufficient proof of cause to defeat an action for malicious prosecution, as held in Lynn v. Smith, 193 F.Supp. 887, 890 (W.D.Pa.1961).

The plaintiffs' claim that Trooper Neil maliciously prosecuted them without probable cause is also undermined by the fact that the prosecutor's decision to proceed with the criminal charge was independent of any alleged malice on the part of the plaintiffs. As stated in Allen v. Moyle, 84 Idaho 18, 24, 367 P.2d 579, 583 (1961), advice of counsel is a complete defense to an action for malicious prosecution when the prosecution is instituted in reliance on such advice, given after full disclosure of the facts to the attorney.

In conclusion, the plaintiffs' claim of malicious prosecution fails because they have failed to establish all the elements of a malicious prosecution action, including the absence of probable cause. As stated in Restatement (Second) of Torts § 667, a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt conclusively establishes the existence of probable cause.

gold_text: A conviction, upon examination by a judicial officer, conclusively establishes the existence of probable cause, regardless of whether the conviction is subsequently reversed on appeal. See Cramer v. Crutchfield, 648 F.2d 943, 945 (4th Cir. 1981) (interpreting Virginia law); Gowin v. Altmiller, 455 F.Supp. 743, 746 (D.C.Idaho 1978), aff’d 663 F.2d 820 (9th Cir.1981) and Diminnie v. United States, 522 F.Supp. 1192, 1195 (E.D.Mich.1981), aff’d 728 F.2d 301 (6th Cir.1984). But see Williams v. City of New York, 508 F.2d 356 (2d Cir. 1974) (a conviction ultimately upset is accorded only the force of prima facie evidence of probable cause which can be overcome in a suit for malicious prosecution). The neutral and experienced opinion of a judicial officer, here a District Justice, that a person was guilty of the charges establishes the presence of probable cause. Since probable cause has been established, plaintiffs’ claim of malicious prosecution must fail. Accordingly, we will enter judgment for defendant on the civil rights claim.
