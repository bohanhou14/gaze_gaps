In determining whether student loan debts should be discharged under undue hardship, courts often employ the three-prong test articulated in Brunner. This test, which entails a "minimal standard of living" assessment, was discussed in reference to case 46 B.R. 752. The debtor must demonstrate that repaying the loan would force them to live below a minimal standard, this minimal threshold being a key determinant accepted by courts (46 B.R. 752, In re Johnson).

Further precedent from reference case 144 F.3d 433 highlights the importance of evaluating the debtor’s expenses and discretionary income to ascertain whether they have minimized their living expenses before seeking discharge (144 F.3d 433, In re Hornsby). Courts must rigorously investigate these financial details to establish undue hardship, without necessitating the debtor to live in abject poverty.

Ultimately, the interconnected application of these precedents underscores that, absent proving undue hardship as defined in these cases, student loans typically remain nondischargeable. This approach aims to balance the debtor’s burden against the creditor’s rights, ensuring fairness in bankruptcy proceedings.

gold_text: Id. (quoting In re Brunner, 46 B.R. 752, 753 (Bank.S.D.N.Y.1985)); see also In re Hornsby, 144 F.3d 433, 437 (6th Cir.1998) (considering the same factors, along with the amount of debt, the rate of interest, and the debtor's claimed expenses and current standard of living). Because the Debtors did not seek to establish undue hardship in the proceedings below, we do not address whether the Debtors qualify for an undue hardship discharge based upon their reliance on ECMC’s proofs of claim, which included only principal and prepetition interest, in planning their finances based upon the assumption that the principal on their student loan debts would be fully paid by their estates.
