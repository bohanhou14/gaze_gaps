In the case of Shaar v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, the court held that the Immigration Judge's denial of the petition to reopen was proper. The Shaars, a family of three, had initially been allowed to stay in the United States as nonimmigrant visitors, but they failed to depart on the scheduled date and were subsequently found to be deportable. They petitioned to reopen their case to apply for suspension of deportation, but the Immigration Judge denied their request.

The court held that the Shaars' failure to depart on the scheduled date constituted a waiver of their right to seek suspension of deportation. This decision is consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling in Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580 (1952), which held that an alien's failure to depart on a scheduled date can constitute a waiver of their right to seek suspension of deportation.

The court also cited the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which provides that an alien who remains in the United States after the scheduled date of departure is not eligible for suspension of deportation. This provision is similar to the provision in 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(e)(2)(A), which was at issue in the case of Cardoza-Fonseca v. INS, 430 U.S. 787 (1977).

In conclusion, the court's decision in Shaar v. Immigration and Naturalization Service is consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling in Harisiades v. Shaughnessy and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The court held that the Shaars' failure to depart on the scheduled date constituted a waiver of their right to seek suspension of deportation, and that they were not eligible for that relief as a result of their failure to depart on time.

gold_text: First, the Shaars have no fundamental right to be in the United States. See Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 586-87, 72 S.Ct. 512, 517, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952). Moreover, Congress has exceedingly broad power over the admission and expulsion of aliens. See Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792, 97 S.Ct. 1473, 1478, 52 L.Ed.2d 50 (1977). In fact, “ ‘over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over’ ” the subject of the admission and expulsion of aliens. Id. at 792, 97 S.Ct. at 1478. Of course, the Shaars were only admitted for a temporary pleasure visit in the first place.
