In the case of MEHRTENS, District Judge, it is essential to consider the implications of the Warf-Hartman identification on the jury. The court noted that the government's actions were "badly phrased" and added to the harm already done. Similarly, in the case 529 F.2d 1170, the court emphasized the importance of proper questioning techniques to avoid prejudice. In this case, the government's failure to disclose Burnstine's role as a government informant may have led to an unfair trial.

Moreover, the court's decision to deny Klein's motion for severance and a new trial was within its discretion. This is in line with the court's ruling in United States v. Laite, 5 Cir. 1969, 418 F.2d 576, 581, which held that the trial court's decision to deny severance is not reviewable on appeal.

Furthermore, the court's handling of the mistrial motions was proper. In United States v. Holsen, 392 F.2d 292, 293 (5th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1029, 89 S.Ct. 640, 21 L.Ed.2d 573 (1969), the court held that statements made by co-conspirators during the conspiracy are admissible. Similarly, in United States v. Troise, 483 F.2d 615, 618 (5th Cir.) cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1066, 94 S.Ct. 574, 38 L.Ed.2d 471 (1973), the court ruled that evidence withdrawn from the jury with a direction by the court that it be disregarded may not be the basis of reversible error.

In conclusion, the court's decisions in this case were in line with established legal precedent. The court's handling of the Warf-Hartman identification, the motion for severance and a new trial, and the mistrial motions were all proper and did not result in reversible error. This is in line with the court's ruling in United States v. Laite, 5 Cir. 1969, 418 F.2d 576, 581, which held that the trial court's decision to deny severance is not reviewable on appeal.
