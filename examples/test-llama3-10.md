In the case of Westinghouse Electric Supply Company vs. Beattie, the company filed a petition to amend its alleged proof of claim by filing a formal proof of claim after the expiration of the six-months' period allowed for filing claims. The court has to decide whether the company can amend its claim after the expiration of the statutory period.

According to the reference case 21 F.2d 182, an amendment must be based upon an original claim, filed. The power of permitting amendment must not be perverted to let in dilatory creditors who have failed to file any proof of claim within the statutory year limited for filing claims. The court also stated that the allowance of the amendment addresses itself largely to the discretion of the court, provided there is a sufficient basis for the amendment.

In this case, the Westinghouse Company claimed that it had mailed a proof of claim to the referee on February 2, 1949, but it was never received by the referee. However, the referee found that no formal claim was filed by the Westinghouse Company within the statutory six-months' period and that no informal proof of claim had been established upon which an amendment might be predicated.

The reference case 20 F.2d 84 states that "where a paper presented for filing, although informal, contains the substance of a formal claim, it is sufficient as the basis of an amended claim filed after expiration of the year allowed by Bankruptcy Act, ยง 57n." However, in this case, the Westinghouse Company failed to file a formal claim within the statutory period and did not establish an informal proof of claim.

In conclusion, the court ruled that the Westinghouse Company cannot amend its claim after the expiration of the statutory period. The company failed to file a formal claim within the statutory period and did not establish an informal proof of claim. The court's decision is in line with the reference cases 21 F.2d 182 and 20 F.2d 84.

gold_text: Westinghouse contends that even if formal proof of its claim was not filed within the statutory period for filing claims, nevertheless the correspondence hereinbefore quoted, and the action of its attorney within such period, constituted an informal proof of its claim and a sufficient basis for granting it leave to amend and file a formal proof of claim after the expiration of the statutory period. The rule that certain acts of a creditor in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding and during the statutory period for filing proof of claim, may give rise to something equivalent to a proof of claim .and afford a sufficient basis for allowing an .amendment after the statutory period for filing, was recognized and applied in many cases decided before the 1938 amendment of the Bankruptcy Act.
