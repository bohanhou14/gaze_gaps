We affirm the grant of summary judgment to the State on Lee's gender discrimination claim. Lee failed to present evidence that supports a reasonable inference that the State's reasons were a pretext for discrimination. The State's proffered reasons for denying Lee's reallocation request were legitimate and non-discriminatory. Lee's evidence, including her own performance and the Department's management decision to have only one leadworker in her section, does not raise a reasonable inference of gender discrimination. We also conclude that Lee fails to prove that the Department's second proffered reason, the Department's management decision to have only one leadworker in Lee's section, constitutes a pretext for gender discrimination.

We also affirm the dismissal of Lee's retaliation claim against McGlone. Lee failed to raise this argument to the district court, and we will not consider it for the first time on appeal. See Anderson v. Unisys Corp., 47 F.3d 302, 307 n. 14 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, -U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 299, 133 L.Ed.2d 205 (1995). Furthermore, Lee's evidence does not raise a reasonable inference that McGlone's actions constituted retaliation for Lee's complaints. See Ledergerber, 122 F.3d at 1144; Montandon, 116 F.3d at 359. We therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment to the State on Lee's retaliation claim.

In conclusion, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the State on Lee's gender discrimination claim and her retaliation claim. Lee failed to present evidence that raises a reasonable inference of gender discrimination or retaliation, and we affirm the district court's decisions on these claims. See Maness v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc., 1 F.3d 704, 709 (8th Cir.1993), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1207, 114 S.Ct. 2678, 129 L.Ed.2d 813 (1994).

gold_text: We next turn to Lee’s argument that the district court erred in ruling that Lee’s retaliation claim was brought against MeGlone in her individual capacity and, thus, was insufficient to state a claim against the State because Title VII does not impose individual liability on supervisors or co-workers. Lee maintains that her retaliation claim against MeGlone, the employer’s agent, is sufficient to state a claim against the State under a respondeat superior liability theory. Although Lee’s contention may have some merit, Lee failed to raise this argument to the district court. Therefore, we need not consider Lee’s argument raised for the first time on appeal. See Curtis v. Electronics & Space Corp., 113 F.3d 1498, 1503 n. 2 (8th Cir.1997). In any event, after construing the facts in the light most favorable to Lee, we conclude that Lee does not present evidence sufficient to demonstrate any adverse employment action that is actionable under Title VII. See Manning v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., Inc., 127 F.3d 686, 692-93 (8th Cir.1997); Ledergerber v. Stangler, 122 F.3d 1142, 1144-45 (8th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of Lee’s retaliation claim.
