The FLSA protects employees from retaliation for asserting their rights under the statute, and a prima facie case for FLSA retaliation requires demonstrating that: (1) the employee engaged in protected activity, (2) subsequently suffered adverse employment action, and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action (see 200 F.3d 1337 and 120 F.3d 205). In this case, while Plaintiffs claim they were discharged for asserting their FLSA rights concerning overtime compensation, the evidence suggests otherwise.

Firstly, there is a lack of clear evidence from the Plaintiffs that their complaints about unpaid overtime constituted protected activity under FLSA prior to their termination, analogous to the insufficient evidence cited in the February 24 meeting of the Appellant in 200 F.3d 1337. Secondly, Plaintiffs also allege wrongful discharge for other grievances, such as salary increases and discriminatory comments, which do not directly implicate FLSA rights.

Moreover, demonstrating causation requires proving that the adverse action would not have occurred "but for" the assertion of FLSA rights (see 50 F.3d 962, 965-66). The timeline and nature of the complaints in this case fail to establish this "but for" causation needed to support a retaliation claim under the FLSA.

Therefore, considering the standards set by these precedent cases and the evidence at hand, the Court finds no genuine issue of material fact regarding FLSA retaliation. Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the FLSA retaliatory discharge claim.

gold_text: Ultimately Plaintiffs fail to make a case for retaliatory discharge under the FLSA, regardless of whether they hinge their claim upon the letters they signed in 2003 or the letters they signed and submitted in 2005. In both cases, Plaintiffs cannot meet the elements required to establish a prima facie case under 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3). Under the statute, it is unlawful for any person “to discharge or in any other matter discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this Act [29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding or has served or is about to serve on an industry committee.” 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3). In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3), Plaintiffs must demonstrate that (1) they engaged in activity protected under the act; (2) they suffered adverse action by the employer, and (3) a causal connection existed between the employee’s activity and the adverse action. Wolf v. Coca-Cola Company, 200 F.3d 1337, 1342-43 (11th Cir.2000) (citing Richmond v. ONEOK, Inc., 120 F.3d 205, 208-09 (10th Cir.1997)). If the Defendant is able to present a valid reason for terminating the Plaintiffs’ employment, then the Plaintiff may attempt to show that the proffered reason is pretextual in nature. See id. Furthermore, in demonstrating causation, the plaintiff must prove that the adverse action would not have been taken “but for” the assertion of FLSA rights. See Reich v. Davis, 50 F.3d 962, 965-66 (11th Cir.1995).
