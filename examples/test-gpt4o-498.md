In determining whether the venue transfer was appropriate, we must examine the “interest of justice and convenience of the parties” standard, as cited in 28 U.S.C. § 1475 and derived from Rule 782 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. The bankruptcy court in In re International Coins & Currency, Inc., 18 B.R. 79 (Bkrtcy.D.Vt.1982), emphasized the importance of factors such as the desirability of having the suit tried in a court in the state whose law will govern the issues (27 B.R. 871). 

Additionally, the consideration of transfer factors aligns with the precedent set in 7 B.R. 154, where the court underscored the necessity to evaluate whether a change of venue supports justice and party convenience, conducted under various statutes including 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a). These interpretative guidelines suggest that the locale tied to the substantial law and facts, as well as the primary business activities, can significantly influence the appropriate venue.

Thus, considering these precedents and statutory directions, we conclude that merely adopting a broad interpretation of "arising from the operation of the business" should not permit transfer without ensuring significant factual support justifying such "operation" connections and considering more narrowly the business operation origins, conforming to the principles outlined in our analysis.

Section 1473(d), on the other hand, reflects a concern that normal post-petition business relations between a debtor and other parties not be unnecessarily disturbed by the fact of the debtor's pending bankruptcy case.
