The case at hand involves a plea agreement between the government and the defendant, Terrance L. Smalls, where he admitted to various drug-related offenses. The government brought charges against Smalls for drug trafficking and conspiracy, and he pleaded guilty to Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment. In his plea agreement, Smalls agreed to be "fully truthful and forthright" with the government regarding his illegal activities. (Reference: 532 U.S. 162)

The district court sentenced Smalls to forty years in prison, taking into account the facts related to the Stoeckle murder, which Smalls did not plead guilty to. Smalls contends that his sentence was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment's jury trial guarantee, citing United States v. Booker, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005). We agree with Smalls that the sentence was erroneous, as it was based on facts found by the judge rather than a jury.

In 284 U.S. 299, the Supreme Court held that when the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not. Similarly, in this case, Smalls's sentence was based on two distinct sets of facts: the drug-related offenses to which he pleaded guilty and the Stoeckle murder, which he did not plead guilty to. Therefore, we vacate Smalls's sentence and remand for resentencing.

We find that Smalls's Sixth Amendment contention was plain error, as it was not raised at the time of sentencing. However, Booker has abrogated our previously settled law, rendering plain the error made by the sentencing court. As a result, we exercise our discretion to notice the plain error and vacate Smalls's sentence. (Reference: United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993))

gold_text: . The Sixth Amendment — unlike the Fifth Amendment — is offense-specific, in that its invocation as to a pending offense would not preclude police from interrogating a suspect about an unrelated offense. See Texas v. Cobb, 532 U.S. 162, 173-74, 121 S.Ct. 1335, 149 L.Ed.2d 321 (2001) (holding that Sixth Amendment right to counsel encompasses only offenses that "would be considered same offense under the Blockburger test”) (citing Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932) ("where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not”)). In this appeal, however, the Government makes no contention that the Stoeckle murder was a separate offense, under Blockburger, from the drug offenses with which Smalls was charged.
