Based on the reference cases, it is clear that the juvenile's request for his father was not the functional equivalent of a request for an attorney. In Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979), the Court determined that a juvenile's request for his probation officer did not constitute an invocation of his right to counsel. Similarly, in the case at hand, Riley's request for his father was not a request for an attorney.

Furthermore, the Court in Fare identified several factors relevant to determining the validity of a Miranda waiver, including the juvenile's age, experience, education, background, and intelligence, as well as whether he has the capacity to understand the warnings given him, the nature of his Fifth Amendment rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights. See 442 U.S. at 725, 99 S.Ct. 2560. In the case at hand, Riley's father is not trained in the law and was not in a position to advise Riley as to his legal rights. Therefore, Riley's request for his father was not the functional equivalent of a request for an attorney.

In conclusion, based on the reference cases, it is clear that the juvenile's request for his father was not the functional equivalent of a request for an attorney. The Court in Fare identified several factors relevant to determining the validity of a Miranda waiver, including the juvenile's age, experience, education, background, and intelligence, as well as whether he has the capacity to understand the warnings given him, the nature of his Fifth Amendment rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights. See 442 U.S. at 725, 99 S.Ct. 2560.

Additionally, in another case, a juvenile was convicted of murder and argued that his confession was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. The court held that the confession was voluntary and that the juvenile's request for his father was not a request for an attorney. See 148 F.3d 747. This decision supports the conclusion that the juvenile's request for his father was not the functional equivalent of a request for an attorney.

In summary, based on the reference cases, it is clear that the juvenile's request for his father was not the functional equivalent of a request for an attorney. The Court in Fare identified several factors relevant to determining the validity of a Miranda

gold_text: Since Fare was decided, this court has expanded the list of relevant factors. For example, in U.S. ex rel. Riley v. Franzen, 653 F.2d 1153, 1161 (7th Cir.1981), this court held that “a request which manifests the juvenile’s desire to see his parent in order to obtain an attorney must be treat ed differently from a request ... in which there is no such manifestation.” Ultimately, the focus of the inquiry is whether the police engaged in abusive practices, not whether the juvenile offender wisely waived his rights to remain silent and to an attorney. Rice v. Cooper, 148 F.3d 747, 750-51 (7th Cir.1998) {Miranda waiver by mentally retarded, 16-year-old defendant was valid where police reasonably believed the defendant understood the rights he was waiving).
