The case of Sotomayor v. Jimenez presents a complex issue of whether the 1994 deportation order can be used as evidence in a subsequent criminal trial for illegal reentry. The defendant, Jimenez, argues that the waiver of his right to counsel and appeal was coerced and therefore invalid. The court must consider whether the deportation hearing was fundamentally unfair and whether Jimenez was prejudiced by the lack of counsel and appeal.

In Montilla v. INS, 926 F.2d 162, the court held that an alien is not required to show prejudice before being entitled to relief if the INS failed to adhere to its own regulations. The court also emphasized that the right to counsel is a fundamental right that must be carefully considered. In this case, the court found that the threat of indefinite imprisonment was coercive and therefore invalid.

In Waldron v. INS, 994 F.2d 71, the court held that an alien must demonstrate prejudice before being entitled to relief if the INS failed to adhere to its own regulations. The court found that the alien's failure to show prejudice was a fatal flaw in his argument.

In this case, the court found that the deportation hearing was procedurally infirm, but that the errors did not prejudice Jimenez. The court noted that the defendant had failed to demonstrate that either counsel or an appeal could have yielded him any possible relief from deportation. The court also found that the defendant's argument that counsel might have successfully launched a habeas corpus attack on his narcotics convictions was not supported by competent evidence.

In conclusion, the court's decision is consistent with the precedent established in Montilla and Waldron. The court found that the deportation hearing was procedurally infirm, but that the errors did not prejudice Jimenez. The court's decision is also consistent with the doctrine of the "presumption of regularity" that attaches to final judgments, even when the question is waiver of constitutional rights.

gold_text: . Delendanl relics on two opinions, Montilla v. ÍNS, 926 F.2d 162 (2d Cir.1991) ("Montilla") and Waldron v. INS, 994 F.2d 71 (2d Cir.1993) ("Waldron I ”), for the proposition that there is no requirement that a fundamental error be prejudicial in order for a motion to suppress such as this one to succeed. Defendant misapprehends the law in this area. Montilla is inapposite because it applies only in the context of a direct appeal Irom a deportation order. Fares, decided after Mantilla, clearly established the law in this circuit with regard to collateral attacks such as this one and Fares requires a finding of prejudice.
