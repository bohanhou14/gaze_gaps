Petitioner's final issue contends that the introduction of the two pistols found during his arrest violates his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, claiming the search was illegal. Referencing Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, the precedents establish that federal courts generally avoid relitigating Fourth Amendment claims on habeas corpus review if the defendant had a full and fair opportunity to litigate those claims in state court. In this case, state courts thoroughly reviewed the legitimacy of the search and seizure.

Further, as observed in Charles v. Clark, 609 F.2d 216, excluding evidence is a deterrence mechanism unrelated to the reliability or integrity of the fact-finding process. Petitioner’s counsel had every opportunity to challenge the legality of the search and the evidence obtained during the trial and subsequent appeals.

Therefore, the Court finds no constitutional violation in admitting the two pistols into evidence. This conclusion is consistent with controlling precedent regarding the exclusionary rule and the scope of habeas corpus relief. Accordingly, the Court denies the petitioner’s claim. The Magistrate's Report is hereby affirmed in full.

gold_text: The Magistrate did not review any claims made by petitioner in regard to the allegedly illegal search of the car incident to his arrest which culminated in the introduction of the two pistols into evidence at the trial. Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976) bars review of the petitioner’s Fourth Amendment claims. The Court finds that the petitioner had opportunities for full and fair litigation of his Fourth Amendment challenges in the state court proceedings, thus this Court is barred from re-examining these claims in a habeas corpus proceeding. See, Williams v. Brown, 609 F.2d 216, 218 (5th Cir. 1980). Petitioner’s assertion that Stone v. Powell was wrongly decided in no way alters this Court’s views on its applicability to this case. Therefore the search and seizure claims of petitioner may not form a basis for a grant of the writ of habeas corpus.
