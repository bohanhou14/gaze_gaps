Based on the reference cases, we can see that the Georgia court ruled that the results of a polygraph examination are not admissible into evidence and have no probative value, unless both parties agree to stipulate to admissibility. In State v. Chambers, the Georgia Supreme Court held that the results of a lie detector test shall be admissible as evidence for the jury to attach to them whatever probative value they may find them to have, but only upon an express stipulation of the parties. 240 Ga. 76, 239 S.E.2d 324 (1977). This ruling is consistent with the cases in 683 F.2d 1332 and 648 F.2d 981, which held that the state's failure to raise lack of exhaustion in the district court constitutes waiver of the exhaustion requirement.

In the case at hand, the Georgia Supreme Court denied the petition for writ of certiorari, and the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of habeas relief. The district court, adopting the Magistrate's recommendation, denied relief on the basis that appellant's constitutional rights had not been infringed. Appellant argues that the Georgia rule violates his Sixth Amendment right to compel witnesses in his favor and that even if the Georgia rule substantively passes constitutional muster, where a prosecutor refuses to stipulate to the admissibility of a polygraph test, written reasons must be given for the refusal. However, the Georgia Supreme Court has consistently held that polygraph evidence is not admissible as a matter of right, and the state court's ruling is not challenged on appeal.

In conclusion, based on the reference cases and the Georgia court's ruling, we conclude that the Georgia rule of inadmissibility of polygraph evidence, absent a stipulation by the parties, is not unconstitutional, and there is no basis for requiring written reasons for refusal to stipulate. The district court's ruling denying habeas relief is AFFIRMED. 595 F.2d 247.

Appellees, however, have made no allegation of failure to exhaust state remedies. Any such challenge is therefore waived. Lamb v. Jernigan, 683 F.2d 1332 at 1335 n.1 (11th Cir. 1982); Hopkins v.
