As we review the case, we must consider the findings of the trial examiner and the Commission. The Commission's complaint was that petitioners represented that Kleerex was an effective treatment for pimples, but no such representation was ever made. The Commission purported to find an implied representation to that effect, but this finding is not supported by substantial evidence. The Commission's conclusion was reached despite its express findings that the ingredients of Kleerex have a tendency to dry up surface lesions, decrease the number of organisms on the skin, and relieve pain and itching.

In this case, we must follow the Supreme Court's guidance in Federal Trade Comm. v. Royal Milling Co., 288 U.S. 212, where it was pointed out that judicial review is limited to ascertaining whether the Commission has made an allowable judgment in its choice of remedy. In Jacob Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Comm., 327 U.S. 608, the Court stated that the power to modify the remedy extends to the remedy, but such power is limited and extends no further than to ascertain whether the Commission has made an allowable judgment in its choice of remedy.

In reviewing the Commission's order, we must consider the trial examiner's report and the evidence presented. The trial examiner's findings are part of the record and must be given probative force. As the Supreme Court stated in Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1951, 71 S.Ct. 456, the findings of the examiner are to be considered along with the consistency and inherent probability of testimony.

In conclusion, the Commission's order is subject to review and is not supported by substantial evidence. The Commission's finding that petitioners made a representation that Kleerex was an effective treatment for pimples is not supported by the record. The trial examiner's report and the evidence presented demonstrate that Kleerex is a product that can dry up surface lesions, decrease the number of organisms on the skin, and relieve pain and itching. The Commission's order is an overreach and should be vacated.
