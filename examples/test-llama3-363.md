In reviewing the legal cases, it is essential to examine the evidence presented and the court's ruling. In the case of Jose David Mendoza, the court's decision was based on the evidence presented, which was sufficient to support the conviction.

In considering the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the court noted that it is a general rule not to consider such claims on direct appeal, citing United States v. Karterman, 60 F.3d 576, 579 (9th Cir.1995). However, the court may consider such claims where the record is sufficiently complete to allow it to decide the issue, citing United States v. Oplinger, 150 F.3d 1061, 1071 (9th Cir.1998).

The court concluded that Mendoza's ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed on direct appeal because the record was insufficient to determine whether counsel's actions or omissions were deficient or prejudicial, citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Johnson v. Baldwin, 114 F.3d 835, 837-38 (9th Cir.1997).

In addressing the evidence of Mendoza's attack on Kirtley, the court noted that evidence of a defendant's assault on a witness who has or may testify against him is probative of consciousness of guilt, citing United States v. Castillo, 615 F.2d 878, 885 (9th Cir.1980). The court concluded that the jury could reasonably have inferred that the attack was in retaliation for Kirtley's cooperation with the DEA and the prosecution, or that Mendoza was seeking to discourage further cooperation.

In the case of 976 F.2d 1226, the court considered the admission of evidence under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The court noted that whether the district court properly admitted evidence under the Rule 403 balancing test is reviewed for abuse of discretion, citing Skillman, 922 F.2d at 1373. The court concluded that the introduction of the items bearing swastikas was unfairly prejudicial because swastikas evoke images of the atrocities committed by the Nazi's during World War II and that this prejudice substantially outweighed the probative value of the evidence, citing Skillman,

gold_text: Nor has Mendoza demonstrated plain error in the district court’s refusal to exclude the evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. See United States v. Matthews, 226 F.3d 1075, 1081-82 (9th Cir. 2000). Balancing under Rule 403 requires consideration of whether the danger of unfair prejudice “substantially outweighed” the probative value of the evidence. United States v. McInnis, 976 F.2d 1226, 1231 (9th Cir.1992). Although the evidence was undoubtedly somewhat prejudicial inasmuch as it revealed that Mendoza was capable of violence, we see no reason to believe that any prejudice was unfair — that is, that the evidence had “an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis.” Id. (quoting Fed. R.Evid. 403 advisory committee notes). Moreover, the potential prejudice did not “substantially outweigh” the clear probative value of the evidence. Id. Thus, it was not plain error to admit the testimony.
