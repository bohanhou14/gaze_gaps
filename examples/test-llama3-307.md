Based on the provided reference cases, we can analyze the legal issues related to retaliation and Title VII. In the case of Barrow v. NOSSA, 10 F.3d 292, the court held that a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that they engaged in protected activity, an adverse employment action occurred, and there was a causal connection between the two. The court also stated that a defendant can establish a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action and that the plaintiff must show that the reason was a pretext for retaliation.

In the case of Hollander v. American Cyanamid Co., 970 F.2d 39, the court held that a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that they engaged in protected activity, an adverse employment action occurred, and there was a causal connection between the two. The court also stated that a defendant can establish a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action and that the plaintiff must show that the reason was a pretext for retaliation.

In the case of Dollis v. Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, the court held that a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that they engaged in protected activity, an adverse employment action occurred, and there was a causal connection between the two. The court also stated that a defendant can establish a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action and that the plaintiff must show that the reason was a pretext for retaliation.

In conclusion, the legal issues related to retaliation and Title VII are complex and require a thorough analysis of the case law. The cases of Barrow v. NOSSA, Hollander v. American Cyanamid Co., and Dollis v. Secretary of the Department of the Treasury provide guidance on the elements necessary to establish a prima facie case of retaliation and the burden of proof on the defendant to establish a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action. <answer>

citations: ['10 F.3d 292', '970 F.2d 39']

gold_text: A showing of three elements is required in order to make out a prima facie case of retaliation: (1) the plaintiff engaged in activity protected by Title VII; (2) an adverse employment action occurred; and (3) there was a causal connection between the participation in the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Barrow v. New Orleans S.S. Ass’n, 10 F.3d 292, 298 (5th Cir.1994) (citing Shirley v. Chrysler First, Inc., 970 F.2d 39, 42 (5th Cir.1992)). There can be no question that Dollis’ retaliation claims satisfy the first element of the analysis, filing an administrative complaint is clearly protected activity. However, we agree with the magistrate’s finding that none of Dollis’ retaliation complaints involved adverse personnel actions.
