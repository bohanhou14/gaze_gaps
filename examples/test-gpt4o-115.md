**Generation:**

Plaintiff's argument that ongoing treatment for his back injuries, including cortisone injections, means his impairment is not "temporary" does not alter the outcome. In **Kelly v. Drexel Univ., 94 F.3d 102**, the court held that the individual must show that an impairment "substantially limits" one or more of their major life activities to qualify as disabled under the ADA. The court in Kelly emphasized that walking is a major life activity but merely having an impairment is insufficient; it must substantially limit the individual's ability (Kelly, 907 F.Supp. at 873-74). Similarly, in **Dutcher v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, 53 F.3d 723**, the court concluded that an impairment affecting only a narrow range of jobs does not constitute a substantial limitation on a major life activity.

Plaintiff has not demonstrated that his back injury substantially limited a major life activity as required under the ADA. The evidence shows that Plaintiff was cleared to work without restrictions as of November 15, 1993, indicating no long-term substantial limitation (Rakestraw, 898 F.Supp. at 390). Furthermore, Plaintiff's ongoing treatments do not transform a temporary condition into a permanent or long-term impairment within the ADA's meaning. Therefore, Plaintiff fails to satisfy the first element of the prima facie case, proving he was "disabled" under the ADA's criteria, and thus cannot prevail in his ADA claim.

gold_text: However, this Court concludes that such treatment is insufficient to establish that Plaintiff is “disabled,” i.e. that he is “substantially limited in one of his life activities.” Plaintiff lists his inability to among other things “carry groceries, mow his lawn and wash his dog” as evidence of his disability. However, this Court interprets the term “substantially” to require far greater limitation on Plaintiff’s ability to “perform manual tasks.” A physical impairment, standing alone, is not necessarily a disability as contemplated by the ADA. Kelly v. Drexel Univ. 94 F.3d 102, 108 (3rd Cir.1996) citing Dutcher v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, 53 F.3d 723, 726 (5th Cir.1995). To rise to the level of a disability, an impairment must significantly restrict an individual’s major life activities. Impairments that result in only minor limitations are not disabilities. 2 EEOC Compliance Manual § 902, 902-19.
