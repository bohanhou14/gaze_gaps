In assessing Smith's statements, it is pertinent to consider that mere disbelief or undisclosed motivation should not suffice for liability under § 10(b) as established in the precedent from case 501 U.S. 1083. This decision noted that objective evidence is required to demonstrate that the statement was false or misleading regarding its subject matter. The plaintiffs must show that Smith's comments on 13 July 2000 materially misled the market by either contradicting known facts or concealing vital information affecting the stock's valuation.

Additionally, referring to the method of analysis in 2 F.3d 613, which emphasizes substantive evidence beyond affidavits to demonstrate the contradiction of facts, the district court must ascertain whether Smith’s explanation about the stock decline due to potential sell-offs by early investors was materially misleading as opposed to revealing the actual underlying issues of interoperability and impending inventory return.

Further, according to 292 F.3d 466 concerning attached interrogatories and motions for summary judgment, any of Smith’s statements can only be accounted as systematically misleading if substantive probative correlation between his claims and the actual market conditions are meticulously illustrated. This would ensure that the plaintiffs' assertion about the falsity of Smith’s statements doesn’t rest merely on speculation but is backed by concrete evidence.

In conclusion, to determine the relevancy and impact of Smith’s comments, the court should evaluate if these assertions had materially omitted or falsified information in a manner that significantly influenced the stock’s market perception and valuation, in alignment with the requirements of noted reference cases.

gold_text: A statement of belief is only open to objection where the evidence shows that the speaker did not in fact hold that belief and the statement made asserted something false or misleading about the subject matter. Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. 1083,1095-1096, 111 S.Ct. 2749, 115 L.Ed.2d 929 (1991). Assuming, without deciding, the plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that Smith did not actually believe his statement, the plaintiffs still cannot survive summary judgment on this claim because the plaintiffs have not shown the statement was false. In order for the plaintiffs allegation to be true (and for Smith’s statement to be false) it is necessary that the decline in stock price prior to Smith’s 13 July 2000 statement have actually been caused by the negative interoperability and inventory information. The plaintiffs, however, have offered no evidence that the market learned of this information at any time prior to its release on 27 July 2000, two weeks after Smith’s statement. The plaintiffs claim is supported by nothing more than an unsubstantiated conclusory statement. Such statements are not competent summary judgment evidence. Abbott v. Equity Group, Inc., 2 F.3d 613, 619 (5th Cir.1993) (“Unsubstantiated assertions are not competent summary judgment evidence”); Hugh Symons Group, plc v. Motorola, Inc., 292 F.3d 466, 470 (5th Cir.2002) (conclusory statements are not sufficient to successfully oppose a motion for summary judgment). For these reasons, the district court correctly granted summary judgment as to the statement made on 13 July 2000.
