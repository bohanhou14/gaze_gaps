In the case of Bi Feng Liu, the court ruled that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) did not abuse its discretion when it denied Liu's motion to reopen his removal proceedings. Liu claimed that his circumstances had changed due to the birth of his children in the United States and the increased enforcement of China's one-child policy in his province. However, the BIA found that Liu had failed to establish a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal, and that his evidence was not credible.

In a similar case, Li v. Holder, 568 F.3d 1252, the court ruled that the BIA did not err in finding that a petitioner had not established a change in country conditions sufficient to warrant reopening of removal proceedings. The court held that the petitioner's evidence of a change in the one-child policy was not material and that the BIA had properly considered the petitioner's evidence in denying the motion to reopen.

In another case, Xiao Jun Liang v. Holder, 626 F.3d 983, the court ruled that American-born and native-born children are not treated in the same way for one-child policy purposes, and distinguished evidence of the sort Liu relied upon before the BIA. The court held that the BIA's decision was not arbitrary or irrational and that Liu had failed to establish a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal.

In conclusion, the court's decisions in Bi Feng Liu and other cases suggest that the BIA's denial of Liu's motion to reopen his removal proceedings was not an abuse of discretion. Liu failed to establish a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal, and his evidence was not credible. The BIA properly considered Liu's evidence in denying the motion to reopen, and Liu's claim that his circumstances had changed due to the birth of his children in the United States and the increased enforcement of China's one-child policy in his province was not sufficient to warrant reopening of removal proceedings.

gold_text: Liu relies on two Eleventh Circuit cases — Yaner Li v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 488 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.2007), and Xue Xian Jiang v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 568 F.3d 1252 (11th Cir.2009) — in support of the opposite position. These cases are distinguishable because, on both occasions, the Board did not find that second-hand reports from the petitioner of stepped-up family planning practices in Fuijan Province lacked credibility. Xue Xian Jiang, 568 F.3d at 1258, Yaner Li, 488 F.3d at 1375. This evidence indicated a change in regional implementation of the one-child policy sufficient to allow the petitioners’ cases to be reopened. By contrast, in Liu’s case, the Board found the specific evidence submitted by Liu’s family in China to be untrustworthy. It gave the evidence “little weight” in making its determination. A.R. 6; see also Xiao Jun Liang, 626 F.3d at 991 (relying on the incredible nature of petitioner’s secondhand evidence as a reason to distinguish her case from Yaner Li and Xue Xian Jiang). To the extent the Eleventh Circuit decisions are on point, most courts have limited them to their facts, and we decline to depart from the rulings set forth in the majority of other circuits.
