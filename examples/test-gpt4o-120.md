In regard to Ortiz's claim of sex discrimination, it is similarly unavailing. The collective bargaining practices observed in Phillips Brothers, Inc., from the case 25 F.3d 518, reveal a systematic approach in which certain positions and wage classes were designated and adhered to based on seniority and internal policy without explicit gender considerations. Comparatively, Ortiz’s claims do not proffer sufficient evidence of a discriminatory policy or practice directly impugning her employment.

Turning to the retaliation claim, the Court observes the standard set forth in 939 F.2d 484, which outlines three essential elements: engagement in protected activity, suffering an adverse employment action, and a causal connection between the two. Here, despite allegations of hostile treatment and professional isolation, Ortiz fails to establish that these were direct consequences of her complaint, nor does she substantiate the causal nexus requisite for retaliation under Title VII. 

Given these precedents and the factual deficiencies in Ortiz’s claims, the defendant’s motion to dismiss is warranted. The failure to demonstrate a prima facie case of either sex discrimination or retaliation necessitates the dismissal of the first amended complaint.

gold_text: With respect to the sex discrimination and retaliation claims, a plaintiff must allege that he or she has suffered an adverse employment action. Loyd v. Phillips Brothers, Inc. 25 F.3d 518, 522-23 (7th Cir.1994) (sex discrimination); Reed v. Shepard, 939 F.2d 484, 492 (7th Cir.1991) (retaliation). In this case, both claims must fail because her allegations do not rise to the level of an adverse employment action.
