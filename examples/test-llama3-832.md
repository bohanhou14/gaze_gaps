Based on the reference cases, it is clear that the Government's motion for the entry of a Preliminary Order of Forfeiture as to Substitute Assets is granted. The Court can draw from the legislative history to the section notes that the term "proceeds" has been used in lieu of the term "profits" in order to alleviate the unreasonable burden on the government of proving net profits, as seen in Reference case 775 F.2d 492. This new section was not in effect when the defendants committed their offense, so we can draw from it no inferences, either in favor of or against the use of the gross profits formula for these defendants.

Furthermore, the Court can issue an order forfeiting substitute assets up to the value of the initially forfeited property, as seen in Reference case 129 F.3d 1293. This is because where, as a result of the defendant's actions or omissions, initially forfeited property that is subject to money judgment is unavailable, the Court may issue an order forfeiting substitute assets up to the value of that property.

In this case, the Government has received less than $2 million in payments from the forfeited property towards the money judgment, leaving more than $5 million unpaid. The Government has located the following substitute assets: funds on deposit in a Charles Schwab account with a listed beneficiary of "Matthew D. Weitzman", funds on deposit in a Charles Schwab account with a listed beneficiary of "Weitzman Family Trust IRA", and so on. The Court finds that none of Defendant's arguments warrants denial of the Government's application.

In conclusion, the Court grants the Government's motion for the entry of a Preliminary Order of Forfeiture as to Substitute Assets, and orders the forfeiture of all the substitute assets listed in the motion, subject to the Government's obligation to serve notice to known interested parties and publish notice of the forfeiture. The Court also reserves funds to cover any tax liabilities or early withdrawal penalties that may be incurred as a result of such forfeiture.

gold_text: Although Weitzman does not know what, if any, tax liabilities and withdrawal penalties he may incur if the substitute assets are forfeited, he requests that sufficient funds be set aside to cover any such obligations that may arise. Courts have declined to deduct taxes from the value of the assets forfeited, in part to avoid requiring complex calculations. See, e.g., United States v. DeFries, 129 F.3d 1293, 1315 (D.C.Cir.1997) (when determining assets to be forfeited, “a deduction for taxes could create unwarranted complexities in the administration of the statute”). Requiring the Government to account for possible tax liabilities and early withdrawal penalties before forfeiture would needlessly complicate the process. Additionally, given the punitive purpose of forfeiture, the possibility that Weitzman may have to pay additional taxes and withdrawal penalties for substitute assets forfeited is not unjust. See United States v. Lizza Indus., Inc., 775 F.2d 492, 498 (2d Cir.1985) (no need for the Government to “ensure that a convicted racketeer is not deprived of a single farthing more than his criminal acts produced”). Accordingly, the Court denies Weitzman’s request to reserve funds for the purpose of covering any possible tax liabilities and early withdrawal penalties.
