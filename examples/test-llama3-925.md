ORDER
ARTHUR B. BRISKMAN, Bankruptcy Judge.

This case involves a dispute between Coastal Bank ("Coastal") and Henry Scott Caldwell, Jr. ("Debtor") regarding the Debtor's ownership of a property in Titusville, Florida. Coastal seeks relief from the automatic stay of 11 U.S.C. Section 362(a) with respect to the property, which is encumbered by two mortgages. The Debtor asserts that the property is necessary for an effective reorganization and that Coastal lacks adequate protection of its interest in the property.

The Debtor executed a Quit-Claim Deed in favor of Kaye Properties, LLC ("Kaye") on January 9, 2008, and Kaye subsequently deeded the property back to the Debtor on January 27, 2009. The Quit-Claim Deeds meet the essential requirements for a valid conveyance of real property under Florida law, including the requirement of consideration, identification of the land, and delivery to the grantee.

The Court finds that the Debtor had an ownership interest in the property on the petition date and that the property is non-homestead property. The property and its rental income constitute non-exempt property of the estate on the petition date.

Coastal seeks relief from the automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 362(d)(2), which provides that the Court shall grant relief from the stay if the debtor does not have equity in the property and the property is not necessary to an effective reorganization. The Court finds that the Debtor does not have equity in the property and that the property is not necessary to an effective reorganization.

In re Philip A. Hicks, Case No. 6:09-bk-00549-ABB, Chp. 13 (Doc. No. 80) supports the Court's finding that the Debtor's Quit-Claim Deeds are valid and effective conveyances of real property. Similarly, In re Daugherty, 261 B.R. 735, 738 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.2000) and Moyer v. Clark, 72 So.2d 905, 908 (1954) support the Court's finding that the post-petition recordation of the Quit-Claim Deed did not affect its validity as between the parties.

Accordingly, the Court finds that Coastal is entitled to relief from the automatic

gold_text: The term “equity” is not defined by the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Courts have uniformly held no equity exists in property where the claims secured by the property exceed the value of the property. In re Annicott Excellence, LLC. 258 B.R. 278, 284 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.2001); In re Ramos, 357 B.R. 669, 671 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.2006). Any rental income generated by the Property is not relevant to an equity calculation. See, In re Annicott, 258 B.R. at 284 (finding debt- or, who owned and operated five mobile home parks that generated rental income, had no equity in the properties where the secured debt encumbering the properties exceeded their value).
