The federal defendants' motion for partial judgment on the pleadings suggests that the plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims based on the First, Fifth, and Tenth Amendments. The court must examine the constitutional and prudential requirements of standing to determine whether the plaintiffs have the right to invoke the court's jurisdiction.

Regarding plaintiff Wamble's taxpayer standing, the court finds that he has standing to challenge the exercise of congressional taxing and spending power manifested in the Title I program. The court relies on Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968), which established the nexus between taxpayer status and the First Amendment Establishment Clause.

The plaintiff-intervenors, as parents, have standing to raise a claim under the First Amendment, citing Association of Data Processing Service Organization, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150 (1970). The court finds that the parents have a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy, as they claim that the expenditure of Title I funds in nonpublic schools directly reduces the funds available to public school students, their children.

Regarding the Tenth Amendment, the court finds that the plaintiff-intervenors do not have standing to raise a claim. The court relies on Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447 (1923), which held that taxpayers do not have standing to challenge the exercise of congressional power under the Tenth Amendment.

Finally, the court finds that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) applies to the challenge of the Secretary's decision under Title I. The court relies on Data Processing Service Organization, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150 (1970), which established the "zone of interests" test for standing under the APA.

In conclusion, the court finds that plaintiff Wamble has standing as a taxpayer, and the plaintiff-intervenors have standing as parents under the First Amendment. The court denies the plaintiff-intervenors' standing to raise a claim under the Tenth Amendment. The court will review the Secretary's decision under the APA, applying the "zone of interests"
