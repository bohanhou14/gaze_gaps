In addressing the appellant's ex post facto claim, we note recent pertinent precedents. In 47 M.J. 370, it was determined that the application of an automatic total-forfeiture rule, due to changes in the law after the offense, violated the Ex Post Facto Clause but did not alter the original sentence or findings. Following this rationale, we must evaluate whether the amendments to Articles 57 and 58b, UCMJ, unjustly retroactively affected the appellant's forfeiture of pay.

In 45 M.J. 567, the court found that procedural changes accelerating the onset of forfeitures did not constitute an ex post facto violation if the overall duration of the punishment was not extended. Given that the amendments to Articles 57 and 58b similarly affect the timing rather than the extent of the forfeitures, we cannot establish that the appellant’s punishment was unlawfully enhanced.

Moreover, in 47 M.J. 771, addressing procedural fairness, the court emphasized the necessity of consistent and equitable treatment of servicemembers. Avoiding disparate punitive measures ensures fairness and preserves trust in the military justice system.

Balancing the precedents and the specifics of this case, we find that the appellant’s claims of ex post facto forfeitures do not warrant the retroactive adjustment or nullification of penalties already enforced under the modified provisions of Articles 57 and 58b, UCMJ. Thus, while acknowledging procedural adjustments, we affirm that no ex post facto violation occurred.

Consequently, we grant relief by setting aside the dismissal and reducing the fine, ensuring the sentence’s fairness without retroactively altering procedural forfeiture measures. This adjustment respects equitable treatment and avoids prejudice introduced by ex post facto claims.

gold_text: Appellant’s ex post facto arguments were resolved by the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in United States v. Gorsky 47 M.J. 370 (1997). We intend to apply that decision despite appellate government counsel’s argument that we should ignore our superior Court’s opinion and adhere to our decision in United States v. Pedrazoli, 45 M.J. 567 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.1997), which Gorski essentially reversed. See United States v. Plumb, 47 M.J. 771 (A.F.Ct.Crim. App.1997).
