In the case of United States v. Naranjo, the defendant appealed his sentence on the grounds that the district court erred in finding that he was involved in a five-kilogram cocaine transaction and that the government engaged in sentencing entrapment. The court found that the defendant was predisposed to dealing in cocaine, but not in the quantities of five kilograms.

The court relied on United States v. Staufer, 38 F.3d 1103, which held that sentencing entrapment can occur when the government engages in conduct that is designed to increase the quantity of drugs involved in the transaction. The court also considered United States v. Garza-Juarez, 992 F.2d 896, which recognized that government misconduct of an entrapping nature may warrant a downward departure.

The court ultimately vacated the defendant's sentence and remanded the case for resentencing, finding that the government's conduct was entrapment. The court cited the defendant's statement that he would not have engaged in a five-kilogram cocaine transaction but for the DEA's structuring the transaction on unusually favorable financial terms.

The court also noted that the DEA's informant, Strini, had previously been convicted of drug trafficking and was working for the DEA in hopes of securing a more favorable sentence. The court found that the DEA's actions were designed to increase the quantity of drugs involved in the transaction, and that the defendant was not predisposed to dealing in such large quantities.

In conclusion, the court's decision in United States v. Naranjo highlights the importance of considering sentencing entrapment in drug trafficking cases. The court's reliance on United States v. Staufer and United States v. Garza-Juarez demonstrates the need to carefully evaluate the government's conduct and the defendant's intent in determining the appropriate sentence.
