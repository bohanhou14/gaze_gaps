**Generation:**

This approach aligns with established precedent, emphasizing that mere novelty alone isn't sufficient to uphold patentability but must also meet non-obviousness standards (300 F.2d 942). By evaluating the overall visual appearance through the eyes of an ordinary observer as cited in prior judgments (49 C.C.P.A. 969), the court clearly perceived substantial similarity between the patented design and prior art. Such congruence underscores the design’s obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 103, as referenced in earlier cases (300 F.2d 942). Hence, the district court's grant of summary judgment based on obviousness is affirmed.
