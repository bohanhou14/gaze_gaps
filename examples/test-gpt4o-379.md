III. Failure to Instruct on Lesser Included Offense

In considering appellants' argument for a lesser included offense instruction on simple assault, we find this case similar to the circumstances discussed in 361 F.2d 71. As in that case, the defense did not introduce evidence to differentiate between the levels of assault, maintaining throughout that no gun existed. Thus, just as the court in 361 F.2d 71 highlighted that the jury need not believe all testimony from either party entirely, the same rationale applies here. The jury, by rejecting the no-gun defense, logically did not entertain an unloaded gun theory. Consequently, the trial court properly dismissed the request for a simple assault instruction.

Moreover, the precedent set in 382 F.2d 150 clarifies the significance of consistent defense theories. Here, both appellants argued there was no gun, precluding a lesser charge of simple assault. As stated in 382 F.2d 150, a defense relying on a mutually exclusive theory undermines claims for such alternative considerations. Thus, the absence of a simple assault instruction is justified.

Accordingly, as in both reference cases, the trial strategy and evidence did not support a lesser offense hypothesis. Hence, the convictions for assault with a dangerous weapon stand, affirming the trial court's rulings.

IV. Conclusion

Having thoroughly reviewed the appellants' arguments and relevant legal precedents, we uphold the convictions of both Wiseman and Daniels for assault with a dangerous weapon due to compelling evidence and appropriate legal instructions.

Both convictions are therefore affirmed.

gold_text: . We do not, of course, mean to suggest that a defendant in a criminal case is not entitled to submit inconsistent defenses to the jury. Rather, we recognize the rule to be that “a defendant is entitled to an instruction on any issue fairly raised by the evidence, whether or not consistent with the defendant’s testimony or the defense trial theory.” Womack v. United States, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 40, 336 F.2d 959 (1964) (emphasis added). See Broughman v. United States, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 54, 361 F.2d 71 (1966); Young v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 42, 309 F.2d 662 (1962). However, we think the instant case is governed by our analysis in Belton v. United States, 127 U.S.App.D.C. 201, 206-207, 382 F.2d 150, 155-156 (1967). Belton establishes that in order for a lesser included offense instruction to be proper, there must be evidence “fairly tending” to bear on such an offense to the extent that “the trial court will be reasonably alerted to the factual predicate underlying the instruction requested.” 127 U.S.App.D.C. at 207, 382 F.2d at 156. In the words of Belton: “Here the testimony did not ‘fairly tend’ to bear on [simple assault] and we cannot assign reversible error to the failure of the trial court to glean and array on its own motion the strained possibilities of events put forward by counsel who have mulled over the appeal, but not advanced at trial either by defense counsel or the witnesses.” Id.
