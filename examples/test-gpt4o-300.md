**Generation:**

The petitioner's reliance on Maryland state law treating the indenture as an express trust, thereby arguing that funds were irrevocably set aside by operation of law, is unpersuasive due to the lack of actual segregation of funds. Per **308 U.S. 488**, deductions from gross income depend on legislative grace and require clear statutory provisions. The required conditions of § 26(c)(2) not being met, resembling **311 U.S. 46**, where a written contract's explicit terms control. Furthermore, the clear legislative language, as applied in **305 U.S. 281**, does not support credits based on general equitable considerations. Consequently, because the contract did not require payment or setting aside of earnings within the taxable year but rather stipulated payments in the subsequent year, the decision aligns with precedents such as **43 B.T.A. 426** and **43 B.T.A. 1127**, confirming that no credit is warranted unless statutory conditions are unequivocally met. Therefore, affirming the Board's decision based on these precedents is appropriate.

gold_text: It is familiar law that there are no inherent or constitutional rights to deductions under a taxing law; such deductions are purely a matter of governmental grace. Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., 240 U.S. 103, 36 S.Ct. 278, 60 L.Ed. 546. Consequently, it has been said many times that provisions in a Federal Taxing Statute granting special exemptions are to be strictly construed, and that the taxpayer must carry the burden of showing a compliance with the precise terms of the exemption. White v. United States, 305 U.S. 281, 292, 59 S.Ct. 179, 83 L.Ed. 172; Deputy v. DuPont, 308 U.S. 488, 493, 60 S.Ct. 363, 84 L.Ed. 416; Helvering v. Northwest Steel Rolling Mills, 311 U.S. 46, 49, 61 S.Ct. 109, 85 L.Ed. 29. In this connection, it may be stated that the cases in petitioner’s brief wherein “permanently set aside” was construed for charitable purposes are not directly in point. It is well settled that charities are spoiled children of the law. In re Tiffany’s Estate, Surr.Ct.1935, 157 Misc. 873, 285 N.Y.S. 971; cf. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Helvering, Com’r of Internal Revenue, 301 U.S. 379, 57 S.Ct. 813, 81 L.Ed. 1169. We are not impressed by petitioner’s contention that the statutory conditions precedent to the granting of the credits in question are harsh. Cf. Lafayette Hotel Co. v. Commissioner, 43 B.T.A. 426 (strict construction of § 26(c) (2); Nevada-Massachusetts Co. v. Commissioner, 43 B.T.A. 1127 (same). Such arguments are for Congress and not for the Courts.
