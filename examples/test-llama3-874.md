In the context of the reference case 989 F.2d 822, the court certified a class action against Phillips 66 Pipeline LLC for alleged nuisance and negligence related to a petroleum products pipeline leak in West Alton, Missouri. The plaintiffs claimed that the leak contaminated the groundwater and soil, causing a diminution in property values.

In evaluating the certification of the class, the court considered the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b). The court found that the numerosity requirement was met, as there were over 61 properties within the 0.25-mile radius of the contamination site. The court also found that the commonality requirement was met, as the class members had suffered a common injury, namely the alleged contamination of their properties.

However, the court's certification of the class was based on a flawed analysis. The court relied on evidence that contaminants had been shown in the monitoring wells, but this evidence did not demonstrate a widespread contamination of the class land. In fact, the testing showed that the contaminants were primarily limited to the Phillips property.

Furthermore, the court's certification of the class was inconsistent with the principles set forth in the reference case 51 F.3d 417. In Pruitt v. Allied Chemical Corp., the court held that a plaintiff cannot recover for pure economic loss in the absence of direct physical impact. In the present case, the plaintiffs' claims for nuisance and negligence were based on alleged economic losses, but there was no direct physical impact on their properties.

In conclusion, the certification of the class in this case was error-prone and did not meet the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b). The court's reliance on flawed evidence and inconsistent application of precedent resulted in a flawed analysis. The case should be remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the principles set forth in the reference cases. <answer>

gold_text: A number of other courts have addressed the significant question of whether nuisance law requires a physical invasion onto property. While applying the nuisance law of Virginia, the Fourth Circuit questioned “whether property owners may recover for the diminution in the value of their property and their reasonable fear of negative health effects resulting from the proximity of their property to an environmental hazard such as an underground oil spill.” Adams v. Star Enter., 51 F.3d 417, 421-22 (4th Cir.1995). In Adams, the court decided that concerns that environmental contamination might spread and cause property values to decrease were not enough to overcome the legal requirement that a nuisance be visible or “capable of physical detection from the plaintiffs property.” Id. at 422, 423. Similarly, in a case involving dumping of manufacturing waste materials, the Fifth Circuit concluded in applying Mississippi law that the evidence “failed to show harmful levels of any toxic or hazardous substance in the [plaintiffs] well water.” Berry v. Armstrong Rubber Co., 989 F.2d 822, 828-29 (5th Cir.1993). The plaintiffs could not show any invasion of their property entitling them to recovery on their nuisance claim. Id. at 829.
