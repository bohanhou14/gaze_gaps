In the case at hand, the plaintiff, G. L. Christian and Associates, is seeking to recover interest on an award of $398,687 for constructive partial terminations of a contract. The Court of Claims is tasked with determining whether the plaintiff is entitled to interest on the award.

The court notes that the plaintiff's financial interests were not affected by the termination of the Fort Polk housing contract, as the plaintiff's bid was the lowest acceptable bid and it was not affected by the termination. This anomalous situation is similar to that in Reference case 160 Ct. Cl. 1, where the plaintiff's financial interests were not affected by the termination of the contract.

The court also references Reference case 312 F.2d 418, where the court noted that the requirement for interest on claims against the United States is expressed by statute, 28 U.S.C. ยง2516(a). The court further notes that the contract itself does not expressly provide for the payment of interest, and the plaintiff relies on Defense Procurement Circular No. 97, which was issued by the Department of Defense on February 15, 1972.

The court finds that the circular did not require that the new clause be incorporated into the plaintiff's contract, as the invitation for bids was issued prior to the issuance of the circular and the circular was only effective upon receipt. The court also notes that the circular's language requiring that the clause be incorporated in "new solicitations" did not mandate inclusion in this contract.

In conclusion, the court affirms the board's denial of interest on the award, finding that the plaintiff is not entitled to interest on the award as the contract itself does not expressly provide for the payment of interest and the Defense Procurement Circular No. 97 did not require inclusion of the new clause in the contract.

gold_text: The invitation for bids in this case, which was clearly issued prior to the receipt of the circular, was not required to contain the new clause. Plaintiffs strained argument for a contrary interpretation is rejected. The circular did not mandate the payment of interest on this claim. Plaintiffs argument based on G. L. Christian & Associates v. United States, 160 Ct. Cl. 1, 312 F.2d 418, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 954 (1963), therefore necessarily fails. Without inclusion of the clause being mandated by law, there is no basis for application of the Christian Doctrine. We, therefore, do not reach the arguments of the parties on this issue.
