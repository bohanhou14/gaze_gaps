The principle that a subsequent bona fide purchaser is not protected when the initial conveyance was made to a non-existent or fictitious person has been established in several landmark decisions. In United States v. Throckmorton, 98 U. S. 61, it was held that fraud intrinsic to the original matter tried does not typically void a judgment. However, this doctrine has its limitations, especially when applied to cases involving forged or fictitious parties (25 L. Ed. 93).

In Moffat v. United States, the Supreme Court made it clear that a patent issued to a fictitious person does not convey title (29 L. Ed. 110). This means that the so-called bona fide purchasers cannot be protected under these circumstances. Similarly, in McLeod v. United States, 187 Fed. 261, and McClure v. United States, 187 Fed. 265, the courts upheld the cancellation of patents even against bona fide purchasers, reiterating that no title can pass from a conveyance to a non-existent person.

Furthermore, it was noted in United States v. Jacobs, 195 Fed. 707, that a crucial distinction lies in whether an actual person entitled to the land exists. In Jacobs, the heirs of a deceased member sought the allotment, while in the current case, Chester Hawkins had no legal existence post-April 1, 1899, rendering any subsequent transactions void (40 L. Ed. 95; 54 L. Ed. 590).

Thus, it is evident that the equitable doctrine of a bona fide purchaser without notice does not apply here. The lack of a genuine instrument transferring the title invalidates subsequent transactions. Hence, the patents issued in the name of Chester Hawkins are void, and any rights purportedly derived therefrom by the Iowa Land & Trust Company and its lessees are nullified (27 L. Ed. 226).

gold_text: It is urged, also, in the present case, that the United States cannot cancel the patents in question because the fraud alleged was not extrinsic to the matter tried at the hearing before the Commission. To support this position the following cases are cited: Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U. S. 113, 16 Sup. Ct. 139, 40 L. Ed. 95; United States v. Throckmorton, 98 U. S. 61, 65, 66, 25 L. Ed. 93; Vance v. Burbank, 101 U. S. 514, 519, 25 L. Ed. 929; Steel v. St. Louis Smelt. & Ref. Co., 106 U. S. 447, 453, 1 Sup. Ct. 389, 27 L. Ed. 226; Moffat v. United States, 112 U. S. 24, 32, 5 Sup. Ct. 10, 28 L. Ed. 623; United States v. Minor, 114 U. S. 233, 242, 5 Sup. Ct. 826, 29 L. Ed. 110, But the Supreme Court has often held that the rule above announced is not applicable to ex parte proceedings in the United States Land Office, and that the finding of the land officers in such proceedings, although not open to collateral attack, is not conclusive against the government, when it sues to cancel the resulting patent upon the ground that it was obtained by means of false and fraudulent proofs. United States v. Minor, 114 U. S. 233, 5 Sup. Ct. 826, 29 L. Ed. 110; Mc-Caskill Co. v. United States, 216 U. S. 504, 30 Sup. Ct. 386, 54 L. Ed. 590; Washington Securities Co. v. United States, 234 U. S. 76, 34 Sup. Ct. 725, 58 L. Ed. 1220. In the case last cited it was said that:
