The INS contends that the district court erred by granting injunctive relief to plaintiffs without class certification, an argument supported by reference case 490 F.2d 1360. In that case, the court held that plaintiffs have the burden of showing they represent a class, and relief cannot be granted to a class before an order determining class treatment is proper. Furthermore, class membership must be precisely defined to bind the parties involved.

Moreover, the district court’s approach in issuing a preliminary injunction without class certification contradicts the standards set forth in reference case 452 F.2d 816. The case emphasized that the courts must avoid granting relief to members of an undefined class as it would lead to uncertainties about the extent of the injunctive order.

In summary, adherence to the procedural prerequisites of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, as clarified in both reference cases, is essential to ensure the legitimacy and enforceability of class-wide relief. NCIR must seek class certification to comply with these legal standards and facilitate a clear and enforceable injunctive order.

gold_text: The INS asserts that in the absence of class certification, the preliminary injunction may properly cover only the named plaintiffs. We agree. See, e.g., Hollon v. Mathis Independent School District, 491 F.2d 92 (5th Cir.1974) (when suit was brought by individual challenging school regulations, a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the regulation against anyone else went further than necessary to serve the purpose of maintaining the parties’ status quo pending trial on the merits); Davis v. Romney, 490 F.2d 1360, 1366 (3d Cir.1974) (“Relief cannot be granted to a class before an order has been entered determining that class treatment is proper”); Tape Head Co. v. RCA, 452 F.2d 816, 819 (10th Cir.1971).
