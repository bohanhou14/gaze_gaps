In this legal case, we are reviewing the sentence imposed by the district court on Raul Rodriguez, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery. The court sentenced Rodriguez to 71 months' imprisonment, which is at the high end of the applicable guideline range. Rodriguez argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable, citing his mandatory consecutive 84-month sentences for armed robbery.

In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we first examine the procedure by which the district court arrived at the sentence. As stated in reference case 612 F.3d 1160, a sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court failed to consider the § 3553(a) factors or failed to explain adequately the chosen sentence. In this case, the district court explicitly considered the § 3553(a) factors and explained that it was persuaded to impose a sentence at the high end of the guideline range due to the victim impact statement and the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense.

When reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we consider the totality of the circumstances and the § 3553(a) factors. As stated in reference case 526 F.3d 739, we review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. We also consider the weight to be given to any particular factor under § 3553(a), which is left to the sound discretion of the district court, absent a clear error of judgment.

In this case, the district court's sentence was substantively reasonable. The court considered the § 3553(a) factors and explained its reasoning for imposing a sentence at the high end of the guideline range. The court also considered the mandatory consecutive sentences for armed robbery, which were required by law. We therefore affirm the district court's sentence.
