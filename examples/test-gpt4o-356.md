No Miscarriage of Justice

Perez's appeal claims that his motion for acquittal was wrongfully denied. However, as established in U.S. v. White, 611 F.2d 531, the waiver doctrine limits review of sufficiency of evidence when a defendant fails to renew his motion for acquittal at the close of all evidence. Perez did not renew his motion, thus waiving the right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal. This doctrine bars review unless a miscarriage of justice would result, which is not evident in this case.

Jury Instructions

Perez further argues that flawed jury instructions on territorial jurisdiction and venue were prejudicial. However, he did not request specific instructions during the trial, invoking review standards from U.S. v. Perez, 611 F.2d 531. The concurrent sentence doctrine, as applied in U.S. v. Alfrey, 623 F.2d 418, implies that we do not need to review these instructions since any error would not alter the outcome of the first count, carrying identical sentences with no collateral consequences.

Conclusion

In reviewing the trial proceedings and established precedents, including U.S. v. White, 611 F.2d 531, and U.S. v. Alfrey, 623 F.2d 418, itâ€™s evident that Perez's claims do not warrant reversal. Thus, Perez's conviction stands affirmed.

In view of the failure of Perez to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence, our review pursuant to this complaint is limited to preventing a manifest miscarriage of justice.
