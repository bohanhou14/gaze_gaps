**Generation:**

The essence of the plaintiff’s claim lies in the unique combination and composition of familiar ornamental elements to achieve a striking and unified design. This aligns with the principles from the case law, which distinguishes between mere aggregation of old elements and true inventiveness that results in a distinctive aesthetic impression.

In considering the infringement by the defendant’s Botticelli pattern, it’s necessary to apply the "ordinary observer" test as established in Gorham Mfg. Co. v. White, 14 Wall. 511, and reiterated in subsequent cases. The resemblance between the Botticelli and plaintiff’s Grande Baroque in terms of overall effect and visual impression on the average purchaser is substantial. The designs share a confusingly similar arrangement and execution of ornamental details, which likely induce a purchaser to mistake one for the other. This conforms with the precedent that infringement is evaluated on the overall gestalt rather than isolated elements (186 F. 339).

Further, the reference to how a patented structure must function simultaneously in forming and adhering components (95 F.2d 461) affirms the principle that elements, when functioning as a unit with a distinctive result, strengthen the case for both patentability and infringement. Here, the interwoven ornamental elements of Grande Baroque have been matched in Botticelli, leading to a conclusion of copied overall appearance.

Therefore, given both the principles from the precedent cases and the findings of fact, the defendant's Botticelli design infringes the plaintiff's Grande Baroque design patent.

gold_text: The defendant contends that this rule has been modified, at least in this circuit, by such cases as Dixie-Vortex Co. v. Lily-Tulip Cup Corp., 2 Cir., 95 F.2d 461, 467, in which it was said, “that every element of the design is essential,” and Edison Electric Appliance Co. v. Fitzgerald Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 32 F.2d 705, 706, wherein it was said that a patentee “who claims only the design ‘as shown’ is limited to substantially the form disclosed in his drawing.” Such expressions, however, do not need to be interpreted as modifications of the Gorham rule. The substantial identity of the test of. the Edison case was an express part of the Gorham rule. And the Dixie-Vortex pronouncement that “every element * * * is essential” means only that the broad disclosure made by a drawing, without specifications, cannot be limited to a part or “sub-combination” of the entire design. This interpretation of the terse pronouncement is confirmed by the fact that it cited as its authority only Ashley v. Samuel C. Tatum Co., 2 Cir., 186 F. 339, and American Fabrics Co. v. Richmond Lace Works, 2 Cir., 24 F.2d 365, 367. In the Ashley case,’ certainly the Gorham rule was not repudiated: there the court found non-infringement because there was “no likelihood that” the one design “could be mistaken for the other.” [186 F.2d 343.] And the American1 Fabrics case (which, incidentally, furnishes strong support for the validity of the patent here in suit) as a test of infringement expressly adopts the Gorham rule: the court there found it inapplicable, however, becáuse there the accused design was such as to “foreclose all reasonable chance of con-, fusion of mistaking one design for the other” and because there was “no evidence of confusion.”
