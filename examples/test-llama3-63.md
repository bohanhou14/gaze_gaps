Based on the case law, we can see that the concept of a "substantial step" towards the commission of a crime is a crucial element in determining whether an attempt has been made. In United States v. Martinez, 775 F.2d 31 (1985), the court held that a substantial step is any conduct that is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor's intent to complete the commission of the offense. Similarly, in United States v. Jenkins, 943 F.2d 167 (1991), the court found that a substantial step was taken when a defendant withdrew cash from a bank account and placed it in a briefcase, intending to transport it out of the country without filing a report.

In the present case, Gordin's actions can be seen as a substantial step towards the commission of a crime. He withdrew $500,000 in cash from Anchor's account, placed it in a briefcase, and was about to board a flight to Kennedy Airport, from which he would depart for Helsinki. This conduct is strongly corroborative of his intent to transport the money out of the country without filing a report, as he had previously done on multiple occasions.

Furthermore, in United States v. Bareno-Burgos, 739 F.Supp. 772 (1990), the court held that the duty to file a report under 31 U.S.C. § 5316 arises when a person physically transports or attempts to transport over $10,000 out of the country. In this case, Gordin had already withdrawn the cash and was preparing to transport it out of the country, making it likely that he would continue with his plans to avoid filing a report.

In conclusion, based on the case law, it is clear that Gordin's actions constitute a substantial step towards the commission of a crime, and that he was attempting to transport the money out of the country without filing a report. Therefore, the seizure of the $500,000 and the subsequent forfeiture are justified under 31 U.S.C. § 5317(e).

gold_text: An attempt occurs when one acts in a substantial way to achieve an intended course of action, here the movement of the $500,000 from Connecticut to Latvia without reporting it. To have attempted that transaction, more than mere planning is required. There must have been a substantial step, an overt act, furthering the intended activity. An attempt occurs when one “sufficiently manifested [his] intent to commit a particular substantive offense yet failed to consummate the crime.” United States v. Jenkins, 943 F.2d 167, 173 (2d Cir.) cert. denied, — U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 659, 116 L.Ed.2d 751 (1991). It is “acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the crime ...
