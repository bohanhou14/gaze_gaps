The court must also determine whether expenses incurred by AATI can be reimbursed under the EAJA. AATI seeks reimbursement for expenses including telephone, postage, travel, and computerized research. The government challenges these expenses as non-compensable.

Under International Woodworkers of America v. Donovan, 792 F.2d 762, 767 (9th Cir. 1985), expenses such as telephone and travel, when routinely billed to a client, are recoverable under the EAJA. Similarly, Aston v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 808 F.2d 9, 12 (2d Cir. 1986) affirmed the award of such expenses under the EAJA as reasonable and necessary. However, any expenses not incurred solely in connection with the case or deemed unreasonable are not compensable, as stated in Oliveira v. United States, 827 F.2d 735, 744 (Fed.Cir.1987).

Given these precedents, the court holds that AATI's challenged expenses of $555.55 for telephone, postage, and travel are reasonable and necessary for the preparation of its case and are, therefore, reimbursable. The court concludes that these expenses are incurred in the normal course of litigation and are thus compensable under the EAJA. Consequently, AATI’s total award is adjusted to include these additional costs, reflecting the equitable principles underpinning the EAJA.
