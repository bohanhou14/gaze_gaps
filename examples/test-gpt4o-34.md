In considering Arch Trading's challenge under 18 U.S.C. § 1001, the court must note two pertinent cases: United States v. Norris, 749 F.2d 1116 (4 Cir. 1984) and Sinclair v. United States, 279 U.S. 263 (1929). As established in Norris and echoed in reference case 755 F.2d 362, materiality in the scope of § 1001 is a question of law to be determined by the trial judge. Furthermore, it has been affirmed that there is no requirement for the false statement to actually influence the decision-making process of the agency (Norris, 749 F.2d at 1121; ref: 755 F.2d 362), supporting that the false statement's capability to influence is sufficient.

Additionally, addressing the contention that materiality should be a question of fact for the jury, it is well-established by precedent, including Sinclair and reference case 322 F.2d 523, that materiality is indeed a matter of law. Therefore, the court properly instructed the jury on this point, consistent with existing legal standards. Given these considerations, the conviction under § 1001 was appropriate and supported by substantial case law.

gold_text: Arch Trading also claims, relying on its other § 1001 arguments, that the determination that Arch Trading’s misrepresentation was material was tainted by inadequate instructions to the jury on the question of materiality. In the context of § 1001, however, we have consistently held that “materiality is a question of law to be determined by the trial judge.” See Norris, 749 F.2d at 1121; accord Nilson Van & Storage Co. v. Marsh, 755 F.2d 362, 367 (4th Cir.1985); United States v. Ivey, 322 F.2d 523, 529 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 953, 84 S.Ct. 444, 11 L.Ed.2d 313 (1963). There was, therefore, no reversible error in failing to clarify that issue for the jury.
