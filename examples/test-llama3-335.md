The case presented involves a dispute over the date of valuation for a land transfer between the United States and the Pillager Band of Minnesota Chippewas. The Pillagers argue that the land was held in trust for them until 1911, when President Taft issued an executive order declaring that the land was no longer held as Indian land. However, the court holds that the "taking" for which compensation is sought must have occurred at least several decades before the late date selected by the Pillagers.

The court cites reference case 307 U.S. 1, which states that the measure of recovery for the sale of Indian land to the United States at an unconscionably low price must be based upon "the fair market value of the lands at the date of acquisition" by the Government. Similarly, reference case 179 U.S. 494 holds that a treaty may be modified or abrogated by an act of Congress, but the power to make and unmake is essentially political and not judicial.

In reference case 383 F.2d 991, the court notes that the measure of recovery for the sale of Indian land to the United States at an unconscionably low price must be based upon "the fair market value of the lands at the date of acquisition" by the Government. The court holds that the "taking" for which compensation is sought must have occurred at least several decades before the late date selected by the Pillagers.

In conclusion, the court holds that the date of valuation for the land transfer should be the date of acquisition by the Government, which is the fair market value of the lands at the time of acquisition. The court rejects the Pillagers' argument that the land was held in trust for them until 1911, and holds that the "taking" for which compensation is sought must have occurred at least several decades before the late date selected by the Pillagers.

gold_text: From appellants’ standpoint, there is, at best, a sharp conflict in Rice’s post-Treaty appraisal of the Treaty’s effect, and we would not be justified in elevating his single 1889 comment (“the land that you loaned”) over his contrary 1880 statement, the words of the Treaty, the evidence contemporary with the Treaty, and the Pillagers’ own conduct at a time much closer to the Treaty than the 1880’s. As a whole, the history and the Treaty terms fit considerably better with the interpretation that (a) the agreement embodied a mutual intent to dispose of title, with the understanding (as part of the consideration) that the Me-nominees would settle in the ceded area; and (b) a not-surprising complaint by the Pillagers of unfair failure of consideration after the Menominees refused to come over but were nevertheless paid much more handsomely for the area than the Pillagers had received a few years before. The basis for implying a trust is far too slight, even though we read the Treaty liberally in favor of the Indians, as we must. Cf. Chippewa Indians of Minnesota v.
