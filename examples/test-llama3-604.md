In the present case, the court must determine whether the contacts between the plaintiffs and the Texas Commission on Human Rights (TCHR) in May 1990 satisfied the Age Discrimination in Employment Act's (ADEA) requirement that aggrieved parties file charges of discrimination with both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the appropriate state agency prior to bringing suit in federal court.

As stated in 29 U.S.C. § 633(b), in states having regulatory agencies authorized to grant and seek relief from age discrimination, the ADEA requires that charges of discrimination be filed with both the EEOC and the appropriate state agency. In this case, the EEOC had a worksharing agreement with the TCHR, which designated the TCHR as an agent of the EEOC for purposes of receiving charges. Therefore, charges filed with the TCHR during the effective period of the worksharing agreement are deemed received by the EEOC for purposes of timeliness, as stated in 29 C.F.R. Ch. XIV, Subpart B, § 1626.10(c).

In May 1990, the plaintiffs submitted written and signed statements to the TCHR, which were deemed received by the EEOC for purposes of timeliness. As stated in 841 F.2d 123, the requirement that persons aggrieved must initially institute proceedings with the state referral agency is met by the EEOC's routine transmission of a copy of the complaint to the state referral agency. Therefore, the plaintiffs' contacts with the TCHR in May 1990 satisfied the ADEA's requirement that charges of discrimination be filed with both the EEOC and the appropriate state agency.

Accordingly, defendant's Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment, is DENIED. The court finds that the plaintiffs satisfied the ADEA's requirement that aggrieved parties file charges of discrimination with both the EEOC and the appropriate state agency within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory acts prior to bringing suit in federal court.
