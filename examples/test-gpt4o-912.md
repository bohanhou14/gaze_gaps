The plaintiff’s arguments concerning the Secretary's failure to consider residual functional capacity (RFC) and the combined effect of multiple impairments in determining disability under the Act hinge on whether the administrative interpretations and regulations are consistent with statutory mandates. It is relevant to note that courts give considerable deference to agency interpretations of their own regulations, as outlined in *McCuin v. Secretary of Health and Human Services*, 817 F.2d 161, 168 (1st Cir.1987) and *Hinckley v. Secretary of Health and Human Services*, 742 F.2d 19, 22 (1st Cir.1984). These cases reiterate the principle that as long as an administrative interpretation is a sufficiently rational choice, it precludes the substitution of a court’s judgment over that of the agency's (see *Young v. Community Nutrition Institute*, 476 U.S. 974, 106 S.Ct. 2360, 2365, 90 L.Ed.2d 959 (1986)).

Moreover, it is imperative to apply an established rule of statutory construction that statutes susceptible to more than one interpretation should be construed in a manner that comports with constitutional principles (see *NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago*, 440 U.S. 490, 500, 99 S.Ct. 1313, 1318, 59 L.Ed.2d 533 (1979)). This aligns with the broader principle emphasized in *838 F.2d 23* whereby administrative regulations under 20 C.F.R. are reviewed to ensure they align reasonably with the statutory language or purpose of the Act. Therefore, the Secretary’s interpretation as articulated in the regulations, provided it reasonably aligns with the Act and evidences due consideration of functional limitations and combined impairments, stands mostly on sound judicial principles.

gold_text: Pursuant to these principles, the relevant regulations and rules, 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1577-404.1578 and Soc.Sec.Rul. 83-19, are legislative. The Act provides that the “Secretary shall have full power and authority to make rules and regulations and to establish procedures, not inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter, which are necessary or appropriate to carry out such provisions_” 42 U.S.C. § 405(a). With respect to widow’s disability, the Secretary is charged to promulgate regulations which explain the level of severity of an impairment necessary to preclude an individual from engaging in any gainful activity. 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(2)(B). The regulations and rules were promulgated under these broad grants of authority; as such, they are legislative in nature and must be reviewed under an arbitrary and capricious standard. See Baeder, 768 F.2d at 551; Sprandel v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 838 F.2d 23 (1st Cir.1988); McCuin v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 817 F.2d 161 (1st Cir.1987); Zebley, 855 F.2d at 72.
