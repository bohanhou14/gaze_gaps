The reference case 357 F.2d 124 states that a person has standing to challenge an unlawful search and seizure when they are "legitimately on premises where a search occurs * * * when its fruits are proposed to be used against him." This is in line with the Jones decision, which expanded the class of those who have standing to challenge an unlawful search and seizure.

In the case at hand, the appellant was charged with illegal importation of heroin and possession of heroin with intent to distribute. The search that led to the seizure of the heroin was conducted by border guards, who stopped the appellant's companion and subjected her to a vaginal search. The appellant argues that the search was made without a clear indication that it would produce contraband, and accordingly that the standards established in Henderson v. United States, 390 F.2d 805 (9th Cir. 1967), had not been met.

The court agrees with the appellant that the search of his companion should have been suppressed as the result of an unlawful search. The standards established in this Circuit for a body cavity search were not met, and the motion to suppress should have been granted as to the possession count. The appellant has standing to challenge the search as to this count under Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960), as interpreted in Brown v. United States, 411 U.S. 223, 93 S.Ct. 1565, 36 L.Ed.2d 208 (1973).

In summary, the reference case 357 F.2d 124 supports the idea that a person has standing to challenge an unlawful search and seizure when they are "legitimately on premises where a search occurs * * * when its fruits are proposed to be used against him." The court agrees with the appellant that the search of his companion should have been suppressed as the result of an unlawful search, and the appellant has standing to challenge the search as to this count under Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960), as interpreted in Brown v. United States, 411 U.S. 223, 93 S.Ct. 1565, 36 L.Ed.2d 208 (1973).
