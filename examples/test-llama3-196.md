In the case of United States v. Lindholm, 678 F.2d 856, the court addressed the issue of bankruptcy fraud. The defendant, Vernon Robert Lindholm, was found guilty of filing false statements in bankruptcy petitions, concealing property, and withholding property from creditors.

The court held that the statements made by the defendant were material, as they related to the extent and nature of his assets, his business transactions, and his financial history. The court also found that the defendant's intent was fraudulent, as he knowingly made false statements to deceive the bankruptcy court and creditors.

The court rejected the defendant's argument that the statements were not material, citing United States v. Margolis, 138 F.2d 1002, 1005 (3d Cir. 1943), which held that a false statement regarding ownership of a piece of machinery was not material because it called for a legal opinion. The court also noted that the defendant's failure to disclose prior bankruptcy filings was intended to deceive the bankruptcy court and creditors.

The court also addressed the issue of restitution, citing United States v. Galliano, 977 F.2d 1350, 1352-53 (9th Cir. 1992), which held that the court should consider the amount of loss suffered by the victim, the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs of the defendant and his dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.

In conclusion, the court held that the defendant's statements were material and fraudulent, and that he was liable for restitution. The court's decision was supported by the evidence and the law, and it is consistent with the holdings of other courts in similar cases.

gold_text: . Although appellant claims at the time he signed such statement he was under the impression that his prior bankruptcies had been dismissed, he has also claimed that he is a cum laude graduate of the University of Southern California, that he had attended Western Law School and that he represented himself in both state civil cases and federal bankruptcy court. This cuts against the credibility of the claim that he was under the impression that the prior bankruptcies were dismissed. Moreover, regardless of his belief, appellant was under a duty to disclose all prior bankruptcy filings and their- subsequent disposition notwithstanding whether such prior bankruptcies had been dismissed or not. See United States v. Beery, 678 F.2d 856 (10th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1066, 105 S.Ct. 2142, 85 L.Ed.2d 499 (1985) (even if defendant had considered bankruptcy proceeding to be invalid, that would not preclude convicting him of concealing assets from receiver and trustee in bankruptcy).
