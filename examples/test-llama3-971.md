In considering defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, the court must exercise its discretion and weigh the interests involved. In this case, the plaintiff has alleged a Robinson-Patman Act claim and a Sherman Act claim, both of which are jurisdiction-conferring claims. The court must then consider whether the pendent claim, breach of contract, should be dismissed as well.

As stated in United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 727 (1966), "a federal court should not pass on a state claim when the federal claim falters at the threshold and is 'dismissed before trial'." In this case, the federal claims have been dismissed, and the court must now consider whether to exercise its discretion to hear the pendent claim.

Defendant argues that the court should not exercise its discretion to hear the pendent claim, citing the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction. In United States v. New York Telephone Co., 434 F.2d 1054 (2d Cir. 1970), the court held that "the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction is not a license to exercise jurisdiction over all claims that have some connection with the original claim, but rather a limited doctrine that allows a court to exercise jurisdiction over a claim when it arises from the same 'common nucleus of operative fact' as the original claim."

In this case, the pendent claim arises from the same common nucleus of operative fact as the original claims, namely, the alleged preferential treatment of Market Tire by the Post. However, the court must also consider the interests of judicial economy and the avoidance of duplicative litigation.

Given the dismissal of the jurisdiction-conferring claims, the court finds that it would be impractical and inefficient to continue to exercise jurisdiction over the pendent claim. Therefore, the court grants defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, and dismisses the pendent claim, Count III.

gold_text: Where pendent jurisdiction provides a court with authority to hear a state claim, a court has discretion to dismiss the state claim if the federal claims are dismissed prior to trial. The Court in United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1139, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), stated that if “the federal claims are dismissed before trial, even though not insubstantial in a jurisdictional sense, the state claims should be dismissed as well.” While Gibbs seems to mandate dismissal, more recent cases indicate that it is rather a matter within the court’s discretion. See Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 404-05, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970); Houlihan v. Anderson-Stokes, Inc., 434 F.Supp. 1324 (D.D.C., 1977). Dismissal of the pendent claim is particularly appropriate here, since it occurs at an early stage of the case before extended discovery has taken place, and it promotes the policy of avoiding needless resolution of state claims in federal courts. See Houlihan, supra, 434 F.Supp. at 1330. Since it has dismissed the federal claims, the Court clearly has authority here to dismiss the pendent claim. See Marshall v. District of Columbia, 392 F.Supp. 1012, 1018 (D.D.C.1975).
