The determination of whether sanctions should be imposed under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 requires an assessment of whether the conduct was unreasonable and vexatious, which may involve both objective and subjective standards. In reference case 812 F.2d 393, the court noted that § 1927 demands unreasonable and vexatious conduct and leaves open whether a finding of bad faith is mandatory alongside unreasonable conduct. Thus, it is imperative to scrutinize plaintiff’s conduct under this dual lens.

Additionally, in reference case 908 F.2d 336, the court addressed the liabilities for excessive costs under § 1927 by underscoring that any attorney who unreasonably multiplies proceedings may be made to personally bear the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees incurred. Here, the plaintiff’s continuation of unsupported claims after their untenability was evident could be deemed unreasonable and vexatious, warranting sanctions. 

Given these precedents, and considering the extensive costs and efforts imposed on the defendant to rebut the claims, the court finds justification in evaluating potential sanctions against the plaintiff’s counsel to curb such conduct and promote judicial efficiency.

gold_text: 28 U.S.C. § 1927. Sanctions are called for by § 1927 when an attorney unreasonably and vexatiously multiplies the proceedings. The standard to be applied in such a case is somewhat unclear. See O’Connell v. Champion Intern. Corp., 812 F.2d 393, 395 n. 2 (8th Cir.1987) (“We do not hold that § 1927 contains only an objective standard, as opposed to both an objective and subjective standard. The words of the statute require unreasonable and vexatious conduct.... Whether this requires a finding of bad faith in addition to unreasonable conduct is a question not before us.”). At least one Eighth Circuit panel, however, has indicated that the language of § 1927 requires both a finding of objectively unreasonable behavior and a finding of bad faith. N.A.A.C.P.—Special Contribution Fund v. Atkins, 908 F.2d 336, 340 (8th Cir.1990). See also, Joseph V. Edeskuty & Associates v. Jacksonville Kraft Paper Co., Inc., 702 F.Supp. 741, 746 (D.Minn.1988) (denying sanctions pursuant to § 1927 because “[t]he record does not reflect bad faith on the part of ... counsel[.]”).
