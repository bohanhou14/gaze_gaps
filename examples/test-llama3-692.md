As the court, we must consider the timeliness of the answer and the verified claim of ownership. In the case of Flores v. United States, 950 F.2d 1108, the court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking an answer as untimely. Similarly, in the case of Lundis v. United States, 82 F.3d 582, the court emphasized the importance of strict compliance with the provisions of Rule C(6) and rejected a claim that was not preceded by a verified claim.

In this case, the defendants, dredge "Jumby Bay" and Blue Green Marine, Ltd., have failed to comply with the timeliness requirements of Rule C(6). They filed an unverified answer, counterclaim, and cross-complaint, but have not filed a verified statement of right or interest in the vessel. This failure to comply with the rules is not excusable neglect, as the defendants have had sufficient time to respond to the plaintiff's complaint and have not provided any specific reasons for their delay.

Given the defendants' failure to comply with the rules, the court must strike the answer and enter default against the Jumby Bay. The court has discretion to do so under Supplemental Rule C(6), which requires a verified statement of right or interest in the vessel. The court's decision is supported by the cases cited above, which emphasize the importance of strict compliance with the provisions of Rule C(6).

Therefore, the court will deny the defendants' motion for an extension of time and grant the plaintiff's motion to strike the answer and enter default against the Jumby Bay. The Jumby Bay will be subject to the court's jurisdiction, and the plaintiff will be entitled to a judgment against the vessel.
