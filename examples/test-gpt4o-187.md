In determining whether procedural due process was observed, we refer to the precedent set in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471. Here, the Supreme Court held that parolees must be afforded a preliminary hearing to determine probable cause and a subsequent more comprehensive hearing before final revocation decisions. In the present case, the City’s ordinance and its three limited defenses are scrutinized under these standards.

Moreover, Simpson v. Brown County, 860 F.3d 1001, highlights the necessity of pre-deprivation hearings when property interests are at stake. Simpson underscores that procedural due process is not met solely by post-deprivation remedies if pre-deprivation procedures are necessary and feasible. The City’s ordinance lacks these necessary pre-deprivation procedures, failing to provide owners a fair opportunity to contest the administrative penalties before imposition.

Similarly, Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, emphasizes the need for an evidentiary hearing prior to terminating welfare benefits, reflecting the due process applied in property deprivations. The analog would suggest that the process afforded to vehicle owners under the ordinance falls short for not allowing broader defenses.

Lastly, the reference to Garcia v. City of Chicago, 279 F.3d 532, asserts that procedural adequacy must align with established property rights protections, bolstering arguments against the City’s restrictive procedural framework.

Consequently, the City's ordinance does not provide constitutionally sufficient procedural protections, violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Counts II and III stand, as plaintiffs have plausibly alleged deprivation of their property without adequate due process.

gold_text: The plaintiffs’ state-law arguments are also misplaced. The requirement of due process “is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.” Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). The basic rights guaranteed by procedural due process are notice of the intended deprivation and an opportunity to be heard, although more elaborate procedural rights such as the right to present evidence, confront witnesses, and be represented by counsel may apply in cases where vital private interests are at risk. Simpson v. Brown Cty., 860 F.3d 1001, 1006 (7th Cir. 2017) (citing Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970)). To determine what process is due, courts evaluate procedural safeguards under the balancing test of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), which requires weighing: (1) the private interest at stake, (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation and the value- of any additional procedural safeguards; and (3) the government’s countervailing intertests. Here, the plaintiffs have entirely failed to develop any argument that the procedural safeguards under the City’s ordinance (including the opportunity for judicial review) are insufficient due process protections for impoundment and any corresponding administrative penalties. Instead, the plaintiffs emphasize that the City ordinance violated Illinois law. Even assuming that the City ordinance violates Illinois law (an issue that I do not reach), that allegation is insufficient to state a federal due process' claim. “[A] unit of state or local government does not violate the federal Constitution just because it violates a state or local law.” Garcia v. Kankakee Cty. Hous. Auth., 279 F.3d 532, 535 (7th Cir. 2002); see Colon, 899 F.2d at 672 (dismissing procedural due process claim based on plaintiffs theory that state actor violated state law).
