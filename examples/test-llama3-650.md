The reference case 106 F.2d 530 discusses the issue of patent validity and infringement. The court notes that the patentee's invention is based on the use of water softeners, which was not known at the time of the patent's issuance. The court also notes that the patentee's patent was granted based on the assumption that the invention was new and useful.

In the reference case 96 F.2d 242, the court discusses the issue of patent validity and infringement. The court notes that the patentee's invention is based on the use of diatomaceous earth, which was not known at the time of the patent's issuance. The court also notes that the patentee's patent was granted based on the assumption that the invention was new and useful.

In the case at hand, the patentee's invention is based on the use of a hydraulic press, which was not known at the time of the patent's issuance. The patentee's patent was granted based on the assumption that the invention was new and useful. The court must determine whether the patentee's invention is valid and whether the accused device infringes on the patent.

In determining whether the patentee's invention is valid, the court must consider whether the invention is new and useful. The court must also consider whether the invention is the result of an ordinary artisan's labor, or whether it is the result of a "flash of genius." The court must also consider whether the invention is the result of a combination of old elements, or whether it is the result of a new and original idea.

In determining whether the accused device infringes on the patent, the court must consider whether the device is substantially the same as the invention claimed in the patent. The court must also consider whether the device is the result of an ordinary artisan's labor, or whether it is the result of a "flash of genius." The court must also consider whether the device is the result of a combination of old elements, or whether it is the result of a new and original idea.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether the patentee's invention is valid and whether the accused device infringes on the patent. The court would need to conduct further analysis and consideration of the evidence presented to make a determination.

gold_text: Certainly the presses embodying the claims of the two patents in suit have achieved commercial success. More than that, they appear to have accomplished great productive capacity in plants, such as airplane and automobile factories, where speed and volume production is essential. This has been declared to be evidence of persuasive weight to prove invention. Research Products Co. v. Tretolite Co., 9 Cir., 106 F.2d 530. I am aware, of course, that a clear lack of novelty cannot be overcome by such evidence. Celite Corporation v. Dicalite Co.. 9 Cir., 96 F.2d 242. Having in mind the nature of the claims of the two patents, the makeup of the devices embodying the invention, the state of the prior art, and the presumption of validity from the granting of the patents (Radio Corporation v. Radio Laboratories, 293 U. S. 1, 55 S.Ct. 928, 79 L.Ed. 163; J. A. Mohr & Son v Alliance Securities Co., 9 Cir., 14 F.2d 799), I am judicially satisfied that the patents in suit possess the novelty requisite for validity.
