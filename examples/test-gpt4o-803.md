C. The Retaliation Claim's Viability Under Sovereign Immunity

While the court in Elizondo highlighted that states are not "employers" under § 3730(h) pre-2009 amendments, the amended provision removes the term "employer," suggesting a broader applicability. However, the Fifth Circuit in Reference case 171 F.3d 279 has posited that sovereign immunity may not bar a § 3730(h) action, with the district court reasoning that eviscerating § 3730(h) would harm governmental interests by discouraging whistleblowers from coming forward.

Additionally, in Reference case 535 F.3d 318, it was held that sovereign immunity does not shield state officials from claims of prospective relief when alleged violations of federal law occur, citing Ex parte Young. This principle has been consistently applied in other circuits, asserting that reinstatement qualifies as acceptable injunctive relief.

Considering these precedents, King's retaliatory discharge claim, seeking both damages and prospective relief, aligns with the scope of relief acknowledged under Ex parte Young and supports the assertion that sovereign immunity does not bar her retaliation claim under the FCA.

Thus, the motion to dismiss King's retaliation claim is denied to the extent it seeks prospective relief against UTHSCH and its officials, while recognizing precedent limits on monetary claims.

Conclusion

UTHSCH's motion to dismiss King's qui tam claims is granted for failing to state a claim under the FCA. However, the motion to dismiss the retaliation claim is denied in part, allowing claims for prospective relief to proceed.

gold_text: The amendment to § 3730(h) does not alter the result that UTHSCH is entitled to dismissal of King’s retaliation claim. King’s claim for monetary relief against UTHSCH is barred by sovereign immunity. In United States ex rel. Foulds v. Tex. Tech Univ., 171 F.3d 279 (5th Cir.1999), the Fifth Circuit held that sovereign immunity prevented a plaintiff from seeking damages under § 3730 against a public university hospital in Texas. Id. at 294-OS; see also Nelson v. Univ. of Tex. at Dali, 535 F.3d 318, 320 (5th Cir.2008) (holding that sovereign immunity barred money claims against a state university hospital in Texas). The 2009 amendment to § 3730(h) does not alter Foulds’ holding.. The FCA’s antiretaliation provision does not include a clear statement stripping state sovereign immunity. King provides no other reason for concluding that Congress has abrogated or that UTHSCH has waived its sovereign immunity.
