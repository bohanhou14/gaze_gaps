**Generation:**

The issue of Double Jeopardy raised by the defendants warrants careful examination in light of precedent. In reference case **434 U.S. 497**, the Arizona trial judge's failure to find "manifest necessity" before declaring a mistrial highlighted the significance of considering alternatives. Applying this principle, it is evident that the mistrial declaration here did not infringe upon the Double Jeopardy Clause. Furthermore, reference case **372 U.S. 734** underscores circumstances permitting a second trial despite initial jury discharge, such as a hung jury, which aligns with the present case. Importantly, in **596 F.2d 76**, the assertion of insufficient evidence and an "unannounced verdict" does not equate to an acquittal and does not waiver Double Jeopardy protections when not timely raised. Considering these precedents, the court finds the defendants' claims unpersuasive and denies the motions to dismiss on Double Jeopardy grounds.

gold_text: Having concluded that directing judgments of acquittal would have been improper, the court is of the view that the instant motions boil down to objections to the simple situation of second trials following hung juries. Viewed as such, these cases are squarely governed by the long-established rule that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a second trial following the declaration of a mistrial due to “manifest necessity”, United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824); United States v. DiFrancesco,-U.S.-,-, 101 S.Ct. 426, 433, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980); Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 509-10, 98 S.Ct. 824, 832-33, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978), “[t]he classic example [of which] is a mistrial because the jury is unable to agree. U. S. v. Perez, supra.” Downum v. United States, 372 U.S. 734, 736, 83 S.Ct. 1033, 1034, 10 L.Ed.2d 100 (1962). Since there is no claim on these motions of any abuse of discretion in the declaration of a mistrial on the sixth day of fruitless deliberations, the court is of opinion that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment presents no bar to the trials of these defendants on these three indictments. Arizona v. Washington, supra; United States v. MacQueen, 596 F.2d 76, 82 (2d Cir. 1979). Accordingly, the motions are denied.
