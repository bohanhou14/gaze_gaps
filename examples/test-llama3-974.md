The reference cases 335 F.3d 219 and 490 F.3d 314 provide valuable insights into the legal aspects of restitution orders. In United States v. Quillen, 335 F.3d 219, the court disallowed overtime pay as a consequential loss not covered by the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA), but found that hazmat clean-up costs were an actual loss suffered by the victim and thus recoverable as restitution. The court imposed costs of $4,148.55.

In United States v. Vitillo, 490 F.3d 314, the court reviewed the appropriateness of a restitution figure set by the District Court. The court found that any potential error with regard to vouching was harmless and that the restitution figure was based on evidence presented during trial or at the sentencing hearing. The court also noted that restitution must be limited to an amount pegged to the actual losses suffered by the victims of the defendant's criminal conduct, and based upon losses directly resulting from such conduct.

In the case at hand, the District Court ordered Fallon to pay restitution in the amount of $55,235.86, which was later amended to $57,437.80. Fallon appeals the Court's restitution calculation, arguing that the District Court erred in confining the restitution calculation to the four unenforced lease agreements and in deducting only the default residual value of Derma Peel machines from the restitution award.

However, under the MVRA, a defendant is required to pay restitution to a victim for losses proximately caused by the defendant's unlawful conduct. 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(A). The District Court correctly focused on those leases which the government demonstrated were proximately caused by the defendant's unlawful conduct and for which the defendant did not provide evidence to rebut the inference in favor of the prosecution.

Furthermore, the District Court did not err by deducting only the default residual value of Derma Peel machines from the restitution award. Fallon has the burden of refuting the presumption that ABL's losses were due to his fraud. To satisfy this burden, he would have to establish that if the Derma Peel machines were returned to ABL, they could have been resold or released at a value higher than $2,500. Fallon did not meet this burden, and the District Court credited the testimony of a prosecution witness, FDA Special Agent Douglas Loveland,
