The case at hand raises a complex issue regarding the jurisdiction of the court to review the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision to deny a motion to reopen proceedings based on a conviction that was vacated due to a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings. The BIA's opinion does not provide adequate reasoning to determine whether the alien, Jose Cruz, remains removable under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) due to his vacated conviction.

The INA provides that an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude is removable from the United States. However, the BIA has established that a conviction vacated due to a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings is not considered a conviction for immigration purposes. In re Pickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. 621, 624 (BIA 2003). The BIA's decision in this case does not address whether Cruz's conviction was vacated due to a defect in the underlying proceedings or for rehabilitative purposes.

The government argues that the BIA's decision is reviewable under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C), which provides that a court has no jurisdiction to review a final order of removal if the alien is removable by reason of having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. However, the BIA's opinion does not provide sufficient information to determine whether Cruz is removable under this provision.

In addition, the government argues that the BIA's decision not to reopen proceedings sua sponte under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) is unreviewable because it involves the Board's unfettered discretion. However, Cruz argues that the BIA has established a general policy of reopening sua sponte when an alien contends his conviction is vacated under Pickering, and that we may review the Board's departure from that policy.

In conclusion, the BIA's opinion is inconclusive and does not provide sufficient information to determine the issues at hand. Therefore, we will remand the case to the BIA for further explanation and analysis. See Zhu v. Ashcroft, 382 F.3d 521, 528 (5th Cir.2004).

gold_text: Though we do not decide whether, as Cruz suggests, the BIA has established a “general policy” of reopening proceedings where a conviction is alleged to be invalid under Pickering, we are having difficulty squaring the BIA’s cursory treatment of Cruz’s predicament with its practice in every other case we have examined that presents the same issue. See supra note 3. While the unpublished BIA decisions we have consulted are not necessarily in the category of “selected decisions ... designated to serve as precedents in all proceedings involving the same issue or issues,” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(g), agencies should not move away from their previous rulings without cogent explanation. See Johnson v. Ashcroft, 286 F.3d 696, 700 (3d Cir.2002) (“Although an agency can change or adapt its policies, it acts arbitrarily if it departs from its established precedents without ‘announcing a principled reason’ for the departure.” (quoting Fertilizer Inst. v. Brouner, 163 F.3d 774, 778 (3d Cir.1998))); Henry v. INS, 74 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1996) (“[Ajdministrative agencies must apply the same basic rules to all similarly situated supplicants.”); Salameda v. INS, 70 F.3d 447, 450 (7th Cir.1995) (“Agencies do not have the same freedom as courts to change direction without acknowledging and justifying the change.”). Where there is a consistent pattern of administrative decisions on a given issue, we would expect the BIA to conform to that pattern or explain its departure from it. Cf. Haoud, 350 F.3d at 207 (remanding case to BIA for “fail[ure] to render a decision consistent with or fully explained as reasonably departing from its own precedent”). Should the Board determine on remand that Cruz is no longer “convicted” under the INA, we would expect it to reopen his proceedings despite the untimeliness of his motion, as it has routinely done in other cases where a conviction was vacated under Pickering, or at least explain logically its unwillingness to do so.
