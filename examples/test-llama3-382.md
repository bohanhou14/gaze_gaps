In this case, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of the assessed deficiency and interest paid, plus statutory interest thereon. The key issue is whether the amounts accrued by the plaintiff to its Circulation Dealer Profit Incentive Plan are deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses.

The court holds that the amounts accrued are deductible under Section 173 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The court finds that the Plan is designed to bind each dealer to the group, whose collective effort is the criterion for awarding the yearly dealers' share of profits to the Fund. The court also notes that the Plan is not an unreasonable means of achieving the goal of maintaining dealer loyalty and interest.

The court cites several cases in support of its decision, including United States v. Anderson, 269 U.S. 422 (1926), which held that a contingent liability is not deductible until the contingency occurs. However, the court distinguishes this case from the present one, noting that the liability in this case is absolutely fixed, whereas in Anderson, the liability was contingent.

The court also cites several other cases, including Willoughby Camera Stores v. Comm'r, 125 F. 2d 607 (2d Cir. 1942), Kershaw Mfg. Co. v. Comm'r, 313 F. 2d 942 (5th Cir. 1963), Avco Mfg. Corp., 25 T.C. 975, 1000-1001 (1956) acq. 1957-1 Cum. Bull. 3, and Rath Packing Co. v. Bacon, 255 F. Supp. 809 (S.D. Iowa 1966), which held that indeterminacy at the time of accrual as to the ultimate recipient's exact share of accrued "bonuses" or indeterminacy as to the time of payout does not destroy the deductibility of an accrued item when the amount of liability is absolutely fixed.

In conclusion, the court holds that the amounts accrued by the plaintiff to its Circulation Dealer Profit Incentive Plan are deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses. The court's decision is supported by the cases cited, including United States v. Anderson, 278 U.S. 282, and other cases.

gold_text: Because we have premised the deduction of the amounts accrued to the Plan on our finding that this deduction is justified under section 173, we need not reach the question whether plaintiff would also be entitled to this deduction under section 162, although no attempt has been made to show that as to any one dealer, the amount he may receive under the Fund (including his share of “forfeitures”) is “reasonable.” Cf.
