In the case of Highwoods Properties, Inc. v. Executive Risk Indemnity, Inc., the court was tasked with interpreting the insurance policy's "related claims" provision. The provision stated that all related claims would be treated as a single claim made when the earliest of such related claims was first made.

The court analyzed the definition of "related claims" and determined that it encompassed both logical and causal connections. The court cited the Seventh Circuit's decision in Gregory v. Home Ins. Company, 876 F.2d 602, which held that the common understanding of the word "related" covers a broad range of connections.

The court also considered the North Carolina law regarding the interpretation of insurance contracts, which provides that the goal is to arrive at the intent of the parties when the policy was issued. The court applied this principle to the case, concluding that a reasonable person in the position of the insured would have understood the language of the policy to mean that claims related to the same facts, circumstances, situations, transactions, or events would be treated as a single claim.

The court ultimately concluded that the claims made by Wright and Flake were related, citing the "related claims" provision in the policy. The court found that the claims were based on the same facts, circumstances, situations, transactions, or events, and that they were part of the same series of facts.

In reaching its decision, the court considered the reasoning of the Arizona court in Helme, which was criticized in Gregory for interpreting the term "related" too narrowly. The court also noted that the "related claims" provision was a condition that narrowed the scope of coverage, and that it was intended to ensure that related claims were treated as a single claim.

The court's decision was supported by the precedent set in 205 F.3d 1258, which held that the term "related" in an insurance policy encompasses both logical and causal connections.

In conclusion, the court's decision in Highwoods Properties, Inc. v. Executive Risk Indemnity, Inc. demonstrates the importance of carefully interpreting the language of an insurance policy, particularly the "related claims" provision. The court's analysis was guided by North Carolina law and the precedent set in Gregory v. Home Ins. Company, 876 F.2d 602, and ultimately resulted in a finding that the claims made by Wright and Flake were related. <answer>

gold_text: We believe that the contextualized approach of the Seventh Circuit in Gregory v. Home Ins. Co., 876 F.2d 602 (7th Cir.1989), is appropriate and consistent with our prior holdings. Gregory held that the term “related” had a common meaning sufficiently clear to be applied to the particular facts at issue. Noting that the meaning of “related” “covers a very broad range of connections, both causal and logical,” Gregory still found that the facts of the case “comfortably fit within” the term’s natural scope. Id. at 606; see also Continental Cas. Co. v. Wendt, 205 F.3d 1258, 1263-64 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (adopting opinion in Continental Cos. Co. v. Hall, No. 97-323-CIV-OC-10B (M.D.Fla.1999), which used the dictionary definition of “related” and found that certain wrongful acts, although involving various types of acts that produced different harms, were clearly related because they were “aimed at a single particular goal,” and constituted “a single course of conduct”). We will not automatically conclude that such broad terms are necessarily ambiguous and will not always construe them in favor of the insured. See Gregory, 876 F.2d at 606. We conclude that a term should be found unambiguous if the facts of the case “comfortably fit within the commonly accepted definition of the concept,” but may be ambiguous if the facts fall on the margins of a broad reading. See id. The facts of McCuen were close to the margins; this case is not.
