To address the issue of prior accusations of theft, we can look to United States v. Record, 873 F.2d 1363, 1375 (10th Cir.1989). The court in Record held that once the court finds that the prior acts are admissible under Rule 404(b), it is required to balance the probative value of the evidence against the prejudice to the defendant under Rule 403. In this case, the trial court found that the prior accusations of theft were not admissible under either Rule 608(b) or Rule 404(b).

Ms. Young's argument that the testimony was admissible under Rule 404(b) as evidence of intent to falsely accuse employees of theft is not persuasive. United States v. Shepherd, 739 F.2d 510 (10th Cir.1984), is instructive in this regard. In Shepherd, the court held that a prior act is not admissible under Rule 404(b) if it is not probative of a material issue in the case. Here, the prior accusations of theft were not probative of any material issue in the case, and therefore, the trial court did not err in excluding the evidence.

In conclusion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the prior accusations of theft. The evidence was not probative of any material issue in the case, and the trial court properly balanced the probative value of the evidence against the prejudice to the defendant under Rule 403.

Ortiz, 804 F.2d 1161, 1164 n. 2 (10th Cir.1986)). We find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by denying Ms. Young the ability to present Ms. Staggs’ testimony.
