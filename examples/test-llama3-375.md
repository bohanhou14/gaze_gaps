In reviewing the cases presented, it is clear that the Bankruptcy Code's definition of "actual fraud" under Section 523(a)(2)(A) requires proof of positive fraud involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong. As stated in United States v. Syros, 254 F.Supp. 195, 198 (E.D.Mo.1966), and Ruegsegger v. McCarley, 262 Or. 157, 163, 496 P.2d 214, 217 (1972), there must be a showing of fraudulent intent or reckless disregard for the truth tantamount to wilful misrepresentation.

In the case at hand, it is clear that the defendant debtor's representations were false and misleading, but the evidence does not support a finding of actual fraud. The debtor's failure to disclose prior loans on the loan application may have been a material misrepresentation, but it was not made with the intent to deceive or defraud the plaintiff. As stated in In re Bebar, 315 F.Supp. 841 (E.D.N.Y.1970), and In the Matter of Taylor, 514 F.2d 1370, at 1372, 1373 (9th Cir. 1975), a failure to disclose prior loans on a loan application may constitute a materially false representation, but it does not necessarily involve actual fraud.

Furthermore, the fact that the first three post-dated checks presented to the plaintiff were honored suggests that the defendant debtor intended to repay the debt, and the failure to repay the final check in September 1979 may have been due to unforeseen circumstances rather than intentional fraud. As stated in Wright v. John Gordon Company, Inc., 515 F.2d 260, the Bankruptcy Code requires proof of positive fraud involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong, which is not present in this case.

Therefore, based on the evidence presented, the Court finds that the obligation is dischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code and grants the defendant debtor's motion for an involuntary dismissal.
