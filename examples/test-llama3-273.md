The court finds that the debt is nondischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4) for the reasons stated above. The debtor acted as the plaintiff's broker and investment advisor over a discretionary account, exercising control over the plaintiff's funds. The debtor did not adequately explain the risks associated with day trading, and the plaintiff entrusted him with essentially complete control over funds totaling $103,000. The debtor's actions were reckless and negligent, and the court finds that he committed an act of defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity. (Reference: See Guerra v. Fernandez-Rocha (In re Fernandez-Rocha), 451 F.3d 813, 816 (11th Cir.2006); In re Hosey, 355 B.R. 311, 321 (Bankr.N.D.Ala.2006).)

The court also notes that the debtor did not charge a commission for making any of the trades, but this does not excuse his reckless and negligent actions. The court finds that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of fraud or willful and malicious conversion. (Reference: See 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(2)(A); 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6); In re Fernandez-Rocha, 451 F.3d 813, 816 (11th Cir.2006).)

In conclusion, the court finds that the debt is nondischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4) due to the debtor's reckless and negligent actions while acting in a fiduciary capacity. (Reference: See 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4); In re Fernandez-Rocha, 451 F.3d 813, 816 (11th Cir.2006).)
