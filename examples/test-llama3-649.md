The question on appeal is when the transfer of an interest in the Deed of Trust occurred for preferential transfer purposes. The bankruptcy court determined that the transfer occurred on March 4, 2013, when the lien created by the Deed of Trust was perfected. The Chapter 7 Trustee argues that the transfer occurred within the preference period, on August 3, 2015, when the Family Trust quitclaimed the Property back to the Debtor. However, we conclude that the transfer occurred on March 4, 2013, outside the preference period.

As discussed in Reference case 326 B.R. 463, when determining when a transfer occurs for preferential transfer purposes, we must consider whether a bona fide purchaser of the Property from the Debtor after the recording of the Deed of Trust would have had constructive notice of the Deed of Trust. In this case, a search of the grantor-grantee index would have disclosed the quitclaim deed from the Debtor to the Family Trust, which suggests the Debtor could not still convey good title to the Property. Therefore, a bona fide purchaser would have had constructive notice of the Deed of Trust upon its recording on March 4, 2013.

As stated in Reference case 534 B.R. 400, a transfer is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in the property transferred. However, in this case, the Debtor already had rights in the Property when she granted the Deed of Trust, and the lien attached to the Property at that time. Therefore, ยง 547(e)(3) does not change the deemed transfer date under ยง 547(e)(2), which is March 4, 2013.

In conclusion, the transfer of an interest in the Deed of Trust occurred on March 4, 2013, outside the preference period. The bankruptcy court's determination is affirmed.
