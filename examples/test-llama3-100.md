The FCC's Order requires all IVPs to provide E911 access within 120 days, which has been challenged by petitioners. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, petitioners must show that the Order is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law" (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). Petitioners argue that the Commission disregarded record evidence that the 120-day deadline was not feasible, but the Commission relied on record evidence that the nation's largest interconnected VoIP provider had already procured a technical solution to meet the deadline (Order, 20 F.C.C.R. at 10267 ¶ 38).

The Commission also considered the unique technological challenges of nomadic VoIP and determined that IVPs must provide only the registered location of the nomadic VoIP user making a 911 call (id. at 10271 ¶ 46). Petitioners argue that the Commission failed to consider the economic cost of implementing the Order's 120-day deadline, but the Commission weighed public safety against economic cost and found that the threat to public safety if it delayed further was too great (id. at 10266-67 ¶ 37).

Petitioners also argue that the Order's 120-day deadline represents an unexplained departure from long-standing precedent, but the Commission provided a reasoned explanation for adopting a different approach and distinguished its prior cases from the present controversy (Order, 20 F.C.C.R. at 10274 ¶ 53).

In conclusion, the petition for review is denied. The FCC's Order is not arbitrary or capricious and is in accordance with law. The Commission has reasonably determined that nomadic, non-native VoIP E911 access is technologically feasible, and the 120-day deadline is a reasonable time frame to implement the Order's requirements. The Commission has also provided a reasoned explanation for adopting a different approach and weighing public safety against economic cost. Nuvio Corporation; Lightyear Network Solutions, LLC; Primus Telecommunications, Inc.; Lingo, Inc.; and i2 Telecom International, Inc. (collectively "petitioners”) have all petitioned for review.

gold_text: . Our concurring colleague reads the Order to suggest that "the 911 requirement would be justified even if VoIP providers could not feasibly meet the 120-day deadline.” Concurring Op. at 310-11. But he quotes no language in the Order stating that, and we find none suggesting that. The Order makes reference to the Commission's statutory duty to consider safety, a factor that is an important element in our analysis, but we do not think these references can support the suggestion that the Commission has ever justified the 120-day deadline on the basis of any authority to ban VoIP service outright. We note that if such authority exists, the Commission has not clearly relied on it in its briefs or at oral argument. In fact, when asked to clarify whether the deadline was appropriate even if it was not feasible, counsel for the Commission replied, "No. No, Your Honor. The Commission believed that the deadline was aggressive, but that it was something that could be met, and it recognized the need to try to force these parties to get going, to get moving,” Transcript of Oral Argument at 19, Nuvio Corp. v. FCC, No. 05-1248 (D.C.Cir. Sep.12, 2006). Because we "cannot sustain [the Commission's] action on some other basis the [Commission] did not mention,” Point Park Univ. v. NLRB, 457 F.3d 42, 50 (D.C.Cir. 2006) (citing SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196-97, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947)), we need not consider whether safety concerns alone would justify the deadline.
