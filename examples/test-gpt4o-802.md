Defendants also move to dismiss plaintiff's supplemental state law claims. In light of the dismissal of the federal claims, the court must determine whether to retain jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3), a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.

The Supreme Court has clarified that this decision is discretionary and should be guided by considerations of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity. See United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726 (1966); Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350 n. 7 (1988). In Gibbs, the Court noted that "if the federal claims are dismissed before trial... the state claims should be dismissed as well" but emphasized that this is not an inflexible rule (383 U.S. at 726). The Ninth Circuit has similarly observed that the decision to retain pendent claims is reviewed for clear error in judgment (976 F.2d 1303).

Given that the federal claims have been dismissed early in the proceedings, the balance of factors—judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity—favors declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. Therefore, the court dismisses these claims without prejudice, allowing the state courts to address any remaining issues.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, defendants' motion to dismiss the federal claims is GRANTED, and the court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims, which are hereby DISMISSED without prejudice.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

Kiewit Pacific Co., 976 F.2d 1303, 1309 (9th Cir.1992) (quoting Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350, 108 S.Ct. 614, 619, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988)) (omission in original). The court finds that here the balance of comity, economy, and fairness concerns weighs toward declining pendent jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C.A. § 1367(c)(3) (West 1993). The court has discretion to remand the state law claims, rather than dismiss them, Carnegie-Mellon Univ., 484 U.S. 343, 108 S.Ct. 614, and chooses to do so here.
