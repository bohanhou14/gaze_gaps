In the case of James Lindquist, the district court imposed a sentence based on an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines. The court found that Lindquist's illegal possession of a firearm occurred subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g). The court also found that Lindquist possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense, in violation of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(5).

The court's finding of a crime of violence was based on Lindquist's Iowa conviction for operating a vehicle without the owner's consent, which the court held was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2. However, this finding was incorrect, as the court failed to consider the distinction between a crime of violence and a crime of violence that is not a felony offense.

The court's application of the four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(5) was also incorrect, as it failed to consider the distinction between a felony offense and a misdemeanor offense. The court's finding that Lindquist possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense was based on his Iowa conviction for acquiring ownership of a handgun without a valid annual permit to acquire handguns, which is a misdemeanor offense under Iowa Code § 724.16.

In United States v. Booker, the Supreme Court held that the sentencing guidelines are effectively advisory, and that the district court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) in determining the appropriate sentence. Therefore, the district court's sentence based on the incorrect application of the guidelines must be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.

In conclusion, the district court's sentence was based on an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines, and the case must be remanded for resentencing. The court's finding of a crime of violence was incorrect, and the court's application of the four-level enhancement was also incorrect. The court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) in determining the appropriate sentence. Reference cases: 411 F.3d 906, 411 F.3d 928, 403 F.3d 982. <answer>

gold_text: . Lindquist also argues that the district court violated the Sixth Amendment when it found facts necessary to categorize § 714.7 as a crime of violence. We have consistently rejected the applicability of Booker to the fact of a prior conviction, see, e.g., United States v. Paz, 411 F.3d 906, 909 (8th Cir.2005), and to the legal determination of whether a prior conviction may be categorized as a crime of violence, see, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 411 F.3d 928, 931-32 (8th Cir.2005). Indeed, in both Booker and Shepard v. United States, - U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the ability of the sentencing court to take notice of a defendant’s criminal history and, as a matter of law, determine whether any prior conviction is properly categorized as a crime of violence. See United States v. Marcussen, 403 F.3d 982, 984 (8th Cir.2005).
