In the case of United States v. Middlebrook, the defendant was convicted of bankruptcy fraud and was sentenced to 32 months in prison, with a restitution obligation of $1,590,190. The defendant appealed, arguing that the restitution amount was excessive and that the district court erred in including the value of a promissory note in the loss calculations.

The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that the district court did not commit plain error in including the value of the promissory note in the loss calculations. The court noted that the defendant intended to cause loss to the creditors by concealing the note from them, and that the note was listed as an asset in the Federal Telecom financial statement provided to a bank two months before the bankruptcy filing.

The court also held that the restitution order was not an abuse of discretion. The district court noted that the defendant objected to the amount of restitution, and the court's decision to include the value of the promissory note in the loss calculations was reasonable.

In reaching its decision, the court relied on the language of the sentencing guidelines, which provide that "loss" is the "greater of actual loss or intended loss." The court noted that the intended loss was the value of the promissory note, and that this amount was reasonably foreseeable.

The court also cited several other cases in support of its decision, including United States v. Berheide, 421 F.3d 538 (7th Cir. 2005) and United States v. Fearman, 297 F.3d 660 (7th Cir. 2002). In Berheide, the court held that the defendant had no actual loss because he did not have any assets to pay back the loan. In Fearman, the court held that the true measure of intended loss was in the mind of the defendant, and that there was no basis to conclude that the defendant thought the value of the building was more than zero.

In conclusion, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that the district court did not commit plain error in including the value of the promissory note in the loss calculations, and that the restitution order was not an abuse of discretion. The court's decision was based on the language of the sentencing guidelines and several other cases in support of its decision.
