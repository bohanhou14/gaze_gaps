**Generation:**

The ALJ's reliance on Plaintiff's ability to perform some daily activities to discredit Dr. Yeltatzie’s opinion is misplaced. Activities such as occasional work, grocery shopping, or limited household tasks do not necessarily translate to an ability to sustain competitive employment. This is especially true considering Plaintiff’s documented difficulties with temper management, social interactions, and attention levels, which align with the significant impairments described in the reference cases.

For instance, in **682 F.2d 707**, the court found that even though Tennant could perform light work, his "personality disorder" significantly impaired his ability to maintain employment. Similarly, Thomas’s mere ability to perform some daily tasks was not sufficient to deny disability benefits, as seen in **876 F.2d 666**, where the court cautioned against undue reliance on minimal daily activities in assessing functional capacity.

Likewise, given Plaintiff's severe impairments verified by substantial medical evidence, it is clear that Plaintiff does not retain the residual functional capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity. The vocational expert’s testimony that the limitations would preclude competitive work further supports this.

Therefore, consistent with the evidentiary standards established in these cases, this Court finds the ALJ's decision is not supported by substantial evidence. The denial of benefits must be reversed, and benefits awarded to the Plaintiff.

gold_text: Tr. at 280. One employer described Plaintiffs work as “slow and irresponsible.” Tr. at 155. In Rhines v. Harris, the Court wrote: “Employers are concerned with substantial capacity, psychological stability, and steady attendance.” In Tennant v. Schweiker, 682 F.2d 707, 710 (8th Cir.1982), the Court wrote: “The most compelling evidence relates to Tennant’s work history. Tennant has held forty-six j obs in his twelve years of employment. His longest tenure at any job was six months. It appears that he has been fired from most of these jobs.” (Emphasis in original.) Likewise, in the case at bar, Plaintiffs inability to hold a job is substantial evidence which detracts from the ALJ’s decision. Given that the most serious aspect of Plaintiffs disability is his personality disorder, the daily activities pointed to by the ALJ, such as being able to mow a lawn, watch TV, and take care of his children (Tr. at 21), do not correspond to the ability to engage in employment on a day in day out basis in competitive and stressful conditions in which real people work in the real world. Thomas v. Sullivan, 876 F.2d 666, 669 (8th Cir.1989).
