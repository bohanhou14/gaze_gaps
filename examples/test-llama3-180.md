**Generation:**



Based on the reference cases, I have written the rest of the case:

The judgment entered for the plaintiffs must be modified to require them to surrender the 20,000 unregistered shares to the defendant upon payment and satisfaction of the judgment. This is in accordance with the principle established in Riddle Airlines, 5 Cir., 1959, 266 F.2d 314, that a private civil action for damages lies for violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and that the defendants are entitled to relief in the form of the return of the shares.

In this case, the defendant, Newman, made misrepresentations to the plaintiffs, Lewis and Hinton, about the purpose of the sale of the unregistered stock and the intention to exchange it for registered stock. He also failed to disclose that the shares were being sold for his own account and that he had purchased them at a lower price from an affiliated company of Diversa. The jury found that the plaintiffs had relied on these misrepresentations to their detriment and that Newman had acted without malice.

The court has already held that the judgment entered for the plaintiffs is proper, and that they are entitled to relief under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Therefore, the judgment must be modified to require the plaintiffs to surrender the 20,000 unregistered shares to the defendant upon payment and satisfaction of the judgment, in accordance with the principle established in Riddle Airlines.

The court also notes that the defendant's failure to comply with the plaintiffs' demand for exchange of the shares was a material breach of the agreement, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to damages for this breach. The court has already awarded the plaintiffs damages in the amount of $103,750, and this judgment must be modified to require the defendant to pay this amount to the plaintiffs.

In conclusion, the judgment entered for the plaintiffs must be modified to require them to surrender the 20,000 unregistered shares to the defendant upon payment and satisfaction of the judgment, and the defendant must pay the plaintiffs damages in the amount of $103,750. This is in accordance with the principle established in Riddle Airlines, and with the court's previous holdings in this case.
