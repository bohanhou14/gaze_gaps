The characterization of the § 1983 claims, for statute of limitations purposes, derives from federal law principles, as clarified in Reference Case 471 U.S. 261. The statute directs that federal law must first be exhausted before resorting to state law, and the application period, along with closely related questions like tolling, must align with state law only if not inconsistent with federal guidelines. In Steiner's case, federal law predominates in determining the characterization of his § 1983 claims and the corresponding statute of limitations.

Moreover, Reference Case 488 U.S. 235 emphasizes that § 1983 claims are best viewed as personal injury actions, applying the respective state’s personal injury statute of limitations universally to such claims. The Court recognized that where states possess multiple statutes for personal injuries, considerations diverge. For Steiner, the statute should mirror the broad diversity of injuries covered under § 1983, suggesting a broader interpretation rather than narrowly focusing on intentional torts.

Given that Steiner’s prosecutions were dismissed in the interest of justice, under New York law, this does not constitute a "favorable termination" necessary for a malicious prosecution claim (488 U.S. 235). Consequently, defendants’ motion for summary judgment on these grounds is supported and the statute of limitations defense remains crucial in delineating these aspects based on referenced precedents.
