The question of whether the 90-day filing period of 42 U.S.C. § 3796c-2 is jurisdictional is a matter of first impression. In the context of ordinary civil litigation, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the time limits for filing a notice of appeal are jurisdictional. See 551 U.S. 205, 209-10 (2007). However, in the context of judicial review of administrative decisions, the Court has found that certain statutory filing deadlines are "claims-processing rules" that do not limit a court's jurisdiction. See id.

The key inquiry is whether there is a "clear" indication that Congress wanted the rule to be "jurisdictional." Id. at 1203. In this case, the language of the statute specifies that an appeal shall not be brought "unless notice of appeal is filed (within the time specified herein and in the manner prescribed for appeal to United States courts of appeals from United States district courts) not later than 90 days after the date on which the Bureau serves notice of the final determination." 42 U.S.C. § 3796c-2 (emphasis added). This language is similar to that found in other statutes, such as 28 U.S.C. § 2107(c), which has been held to be jurisdictional. See 540 U.S. 443, 446 (2004).

Therefore, we hold that the 90-day filing period of 42 U.S.C. § 3796c-2 is jurisdictional. This means that the district court's lack of jurisdiction to hear the appeal is a bar to our review. See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 209 (2007). We therefore grant the government's motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

gold_text: The statute goes beyond merely specifying what procedural steps must be taken to appeal. By its terms, § 3796c-2 speaks to our authority to hear a PSOBA appeal by establishing a “built-in time constraint.” See Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 453, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004). Moreover, § 3796c-2 uses language similar to 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a) — the statute governing appeals from district court civil proceedings, which has long been held jurisdictional. See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (noting that § 2107 “contains the type of statutory time constraints that would limit a court’s jurisdiction”).
