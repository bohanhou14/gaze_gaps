In this case, the plaintiff's claim of constitutional violations and wrongful death was dismissed. The court held that the defendants' actions did not meet the threshold for a constitutional violation under Section 1983. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims of conspiracy under Section 1985(3).

The court noted that the defendants' actions may have been negligent or reckless, but they did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. The court also found that the plaintiff's claims of excessive force and failure to provide medical treatment were not supported by the evidence.

The court also addressed the issue of municipal immunity, holding that the City of Booneville was immune from suit under Section 1983. The court noted that the city did not have express statutory authority to waive its immunity.

The court also dismissed the plaintiff's claims under Section 1985 and Section 1986, finding that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims of conspiracy.

The court's decision was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
