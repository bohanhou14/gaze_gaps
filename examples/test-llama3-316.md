The case at hand is a constitutional challenge to Arizona's voter registration form, which lists the two largest political parties on the form and provides a blank line for other party preferences. The plaintiffs, who are members of smaller political parties, argue that this form violates their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

In reviewing the constitutionality of the form, we must weigh the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments against the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule (Nader v. Cronin, 620 F.3d 1214, 1217). The Supreme Court has recognized that States have a legitimate interest in preserving the fairness and integrity of the voting process (Dudum, 640 F.3d 1098, 1105).

Here, the State's interest in ensuring that election officials correctly register voters as members of parties of their choosing is a legitimate state interest (Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 58). The checkbox method used on the voter registration form reduces the potential for clerical error and ensures that most voters will be able to participate in the primary election of their choosing (Ariz.Rev.Stat. § 16-467).

Furthermore, the State's interest in saving money and reducing administrative burden is also a legitimate state interest (Lemons v. Bradbury, 538 F.3d 1098, 1104). The current system requires only a slight burden on the rights of smaller political parties, and the State need not adopt a system that is the most efficient possible (Munro, 31 F.3d 759, 764).

In conclusion, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The voter registration form does not impose a severe burden on the rights of smaller political parties, and the State's interest in ensuring the integrity of the voting process and saving money is a legitimate state interest (Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789).
