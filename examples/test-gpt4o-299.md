The second issue raised by The Exchange pertained to whether the summons was overly broad and unreasonable. The Exchange contended that the breadth of the summons demanded an excessive amount of information, which could lead to undue burdens on its operations. However, this concern was addressed by the precedent set in United States v. Bisceglia, 420 U.S. 141, which clarified that the authority of the IRS in issuing such summonses should not be restricted in a manner that impedes the effective administration of tax laws, provided there is judicial oversight to ensure the summons is not abusive.

Moreover, the district court's discretion in this matter aligns with the legal principles established in United States v. Theodore, 479 F.2d 749, and United States v. Harrington, 388 F.2d 520, where courts have consistently maintained that while the IRS has significant investigative leeway, such powers are subject to judicial scrutiny to prevent overreach and ensure appropriateness. The referral to third-party records is a standard investigative measure endorsed in United States v. Matras, 487 F.2d 1271, which reinforces the notion that third-party summonses are integral to uncovering tax noncompliance.

Thus, the district court appropriately balanced the necessity of the IRS's investigatory needs against the potential burdens imposed on The Exchange, confirming the legal principle that such summonses, when properly scrutinized, serve the essential function of enforcing tax compliance. Therefore, the order of the district court is affirmed, and The Exchange is required to comply with the summons under the established legal framework.

gold_text: The second issue raised by The Exchange was that the real purpose of the summons was not determination of member tax liability, but general research into the economic impact of barter exchanges. The Exchange produced evidence reflecting a Congressional and Internal Revenue Service concern about barter and its possible impact on the federal revenue. In advancing the contention that a research purpose prevented enforcement of a section 7602 summons, The Exchange relies on United States v. Humble Oil & Refining Co., 488 F.2d 953 (5th Cir. 1974), vacated and remanded, 421 U.S. 943, 95 S.Ct. 1670, 44 L.Ed.2d 97 (1975), affâ€™d per curiam on remand, 518 F.2d 747 (5th Cir. 1975), in which the court refused to enforce a summons which it found was designed solely to help a regional Internal Revenue Service office keep up to date on what was going on in a local community. Humble Oil is a slender reed, since the judgment based on the first opinion was vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of United States v. Bisceglia, 420 U.S. 141, 142, 95 S.Ct. 915, 917, 43 L.Ed.2d 88 (1975), and the per curiam opinion on remand is conclusory. Recently the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has had occasion to explain the narrow scope of the Humble Oil holding:
