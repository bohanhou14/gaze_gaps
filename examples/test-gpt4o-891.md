We remand to the district court for further proceedings on the breach of the protective care duty under the FTCA. While we generally do not direct proceedings or suggest the specific judge for remand, in unusual circumstances, reassignment may be necessary to ensure the appearance of justice and minimize suspicion of partiality as discussed in United States v. Schwarz, 500 F.2d 1350, 1352 (2d Cir. 1974) and United States v. Simon, 393 F.2d 90, 91 (2d Cir. 1968). In evaluating whether a different judge should preside, the primary factors are the judge's ability to disregard previously determined erroneous findings, the need to preserve the appearance of justice, and the potential for waste and duplication against the benefit of fairness (553 F.2d 8).

Regarding the dismissal of the medical malpractice claim, we concur with the district court's decision as the claim was not properly "presented" under 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a). The records provided were too voluminous and unfocused to meet the statutory notice requirement, contrary to the stringent notice requirement elucidated in 473 U.S. 52. Therefore, we uphold the dismissal of the malpractice claim for failure to present an adequate administrative claim.

gold_text: Appellants seek remand to a district judge other than Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, under 28 U.S.C. § 2106. Applying United States v. Robin, 553 F.2d 8, 10 (2d Cir.1977), we find that there is no reason to transfer the case to a different judge on remand. Judge Jackson has shown no bias toward appellants, nor is there any indication that he would have difficulty in applying our holding today in light of his previously expressed views. In dismissing the Bembenistas’ claims, Judge Jackson relied on United States v. Shearer, 473 U.S. 52, 105 S.Ct. 3039, 87 L.Ed.2d 38 (1985), the most recent Supreme Court treatment of the assault and battery exception at that time, and his ruling was superseded six months later by Sheridan v. United States, — U.S.-, 108 S.Ct. 2449, 101 L.Ed.2d 352 (1988). We also find no reason to transfer the remand on the basis of Judge Jackson’s analysis of section 2675(a), with which we agree. Furthermore, the disputed issues in this case will not remain on remand: this court has ruled that the assault and battery exception does not bar a suit for breach of the duty of protective care and that appellants did not adequately “present” their administrative claims. Judge Jackson has not prejudged, nor even examined, the remaining issues to be decided in this case.
