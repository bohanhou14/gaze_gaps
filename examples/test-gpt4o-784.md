In determining whether the district court abused its discretion by awarding attorney's fees against Johnson and her counsel, it is instructive to review precedents such as Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 14, Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 421, and Durrett v. Jenkins Brickyard, Inc., 678 F.2d 911. The Supreme Court in Christiansburg, 434 U.S. 421, has made it clear that a district court may award attorney's fees to prevailing defendants upon finding that the plaintiff’s action was "frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation," even if not brought in bad faith. Similarly, the court in Durrett emphasized that frivolous or groundless claims warrant fee awards to deter meritless litigation.

Johnson contends that her lawsuit was not frivolous or groundless, citing significant procedural history and her genuine belief of medical negligence based on records obtained in 2005. However, the district court found that Johnson’s claims did not meet the legal threshold for deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment nor comply with Florida’s pre-suit requirements for medical malpractice.

Referencing 773 F.2d 1182, claims must lack arguable merit to be deemed frivolous, and subjective belief alone does not suffice. Without substantive evidence proving either deliberate indifference or compliance with pre-suit requirements, the district court did not err in finding the lawsuit groundless. Therefore, awarding attorney's fees to Defendants-Appellees was within the court’s discretion, aligning with the standards set forth in Christiansburg and related cases.

Thus, we affirm the district court's decision to award attorney's fees against Johnson and her counsel.

gold_text: In this case, we cannot find that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney’s fees to DefendantsAppellees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Under § 1988, the court has discretion to award the prevailing party in a § 1983 action reasonable attorney’s fees. A prevailing defendant may receive an attorney’s fees award only if “the plaintiffs action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.” Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429 n. 2, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1937, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). Here, the district court found that Johnson’s failure to support her contentions with evidence from a medical expert rendered the claim frivolous. In the face of Defendants-Appellees’ affidavit from a medical expert, Johnson chose to rest on the allegations and denials in her pleadings. This is contrary to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e), which requires a party opposing summary judgment to submit affidavits when the moving party has done so. When the plaintiff does not introduce any evidence to support his or her claim, a finding of frivolity is appropriate. See Sullivan v. Sch. Bd. of Pinellas County, 773 F.2d 1182, 1189 (11th Cir.1985); Beard v. Annis, 730 F.2d 741, 744-45 (11th Cir.1984). Although the finding of frivolity in this case stems from the apparent unfamiliarity of Johnson’s counsel with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e), “the perception that counsel was primarily at fault in filing or maintaining a frivolous, groundless, or unreasonable claim should play no role in the decision whether to assess attorney’s fees against the plaintiff.” Durrett v. Jenkins Brickyard, Inc., 678 F.2d 911, 916 (11th Cir.1982). The district court’s award of attorney’s fees is affirmed.
