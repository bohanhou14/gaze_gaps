The case involves a collection of two bills of lading by Danzas, a shipping company, through the National Bank of Alaska (NBA). The bills of lading were for the shipment of chalets and roofing tiles from Antwerp to Anchorage. NBA was instructed to collect the charges against the shipments but instead delivered the bills of lading to the consignee, Hotel & Restaurant Corporation, without collecting the charges. The chalets and roofing tiles were sold by the Alaska Railroad to satisfy the lien of the railroad company, resulting in a loss to Danzas.

The court finds that NBA is liable to Danzas for the amount sued upon, $36,731.42, plus costs. The court cites several cases, including 184 F.2d 731, to support its finding that a bank that surrenders a bill of lading to the consignee without collecting the charges is liable for the damages occasioned thereby.

The court also finds that Danzas acted as an agent for the seller, Murer, and that NBA failed to use ordinary care in the collection of the drafts and in carrying out the express instructions contained in the collection letters. The court concludes that the doctrine of avoidable consequences does not apply in this case, as Danzas was not required to make expenditures to protect its property, and that the doctrine of mitigation of damages does not apply because Danzas was not obliged to take action to recover the goods.

In conclusion, the court holds that NBA is liable to Danzas for the amount sued upon, plus costs, and that Danzas is entitled to judgment in its favor.

gold_text: The plaintiff prays for interest on the amount of the judgment from June 1, 1960. The allowance of interest prior to judgment in diversity cases is governed by state law. The interest statute of Alaska provides that the rate of interest shall be six per cent per annum on moneys after the same become due and upon moneys due upon a settlement of matured accounts from the date the balance is ascertained. But such interest may not be allowed on unliquidated claims; and it is further held that interest may not be allowed where liability for the claim is not determined until the date of trial. Columbia Lbr. Co. v. Agostino, 9 Cir., 184 F.2d 731. Chirikoff Island Cattle Corp. v. Robinette, Alaska, 372 P.2d 791. Therefore interest may not be allowed except after judgment.
