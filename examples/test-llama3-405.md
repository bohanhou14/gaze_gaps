Based on the reference cases, a debt can be nondischargeable if it is a domestic support obligation, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5), or a debt incurred in the course of a divorce or separation, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(15). In the case at hand, Plaintiff seeks to establish that the debt is a domestic support obligation.

In Reference Case 146 B.R. 862, the court held that a debt is a domestic support obligation if it is "in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support." Similarly, in Reference Case 56 B.R. 460, the court found that a debt is a domestic support obligation if it is "in the nature of maintenance or support." These cases suggest that the court will look at the intentions of the parties and the divorce court when determining whether a debt is a domestic support obligation.

In the case at hand, the Divorce Decree required Debtor to pay Plaintiff $200,000, which is a significant portion of the debt. The Decree also provided that Debtor shall retain all his right, title and interest in the Maine Property. This suggests that the court intended for Debtor to provide financial support to Plaintiff.

Therefore, based on the reference cases and the facts of the case, it is likely that the debt is a domestic support obligation and is nondischargeable. However, a more detailed analysis of the debt and the intentions of the parties is needed to make a final determination.

Conclusion:
The debt in question is likely a domestic support obligation and is nondischargeable. However, a more detailed analysis is needed to make a final determination. The court should consider the intentions of the parties and the divorce court when making this determination.

gold_text: Plaintiff contends that the debt owed to her is a domestic support obligation because the Massachusetts family court ordered the monies paid to her to enable her to pay off credit card debt that Debtor incurred in her name. Plaintiff established that the debt is one owed to a former spouse and owed pursuant to a divorce decree. See 11 U.S.C. § 101(14A). Plaintiff does not, however, establish that the debt is “in the nature of support” rather than a property settlement. Most relevant is intent of the family court as reflected in the Divorce Decree. Cummings, 244 F.3d at 1266. The Divorce Decree states that the money is “to be applied to the debt he incurred during the course of the marriage, for which Wife is now being held responsible.” An allocation of pre-existing debts usually suggests that an order reflects a property settlement. Baker v. Baker, 146 B.R. 862, 866 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1992); but see e.g. In re Delaine, 56 B.R. 460, 467-68 (Bankr.N.D.Ala.1985); Johnson v. Johnson, 156 B.R. 338, 341-42 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1993).
