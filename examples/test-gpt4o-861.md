**Generation:**

In light of the principles underlying res judicata and collateral estoppel, it is clear that the district court’s judgment did not meet the thresholds established in precedent. As laid out in **reference case 224 F.3d 425**, res judicata requires identical parties, a competent jurisdiction’s final judgment on the merits, and the same claim in both suits. Elements (1), (2), and (4) are undisputed; the contention lies with element (3)—whether the 1996 judgment qualifies as a judgment “on the merits.”

As reaffirmed in **reference case 10 F.3d 305**, res judicata precludes issues that were or could have been raised in prior litigation, contingent upon a final judgment. The 1996 Final Judgment, encapsulating a Settlement Agreement rather than adjudication, does not conclusively resolve trademark infringement or Stauffer's defenses.

Further, **reference case 913 F.2d 1138** employs the Restatement (Second) of Judgments transactional test to determine if suits involve the same claim, asserting that res judicata bars all claims that were or could have been advanced. However, here, the 1996 Final Judgment’s foundational Settlement Agreement lacks clearly defined, adjudicated terms essential for preclusion.

Thus, as **913 F.2d 1138** also stipulates, the absence of determinative merits in the 1996 case means res judicata does not apply. The district court’s application of these doctrines was erroneous.

The doctrine of res judicata "treats a judgment, once rendered, as the full measure of relief to be accorded between the same parties on the same 'claim' or 'cause of action.’ [It] incorporates the doctrines of merger and bar, thereby extending the effect of a judgment to the litigation of all issues relevant to the same claim between the same parties, whether or not those issues were raised at trial.” St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 436 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that the successful defense of fraud in a negligence action is not res judicata as to a subsequent action brought by the defendant for malicious prosecution) (citing Kaspar Wire Works, Inc., 575 F.2d at 535). "If [the four] conditions are satisfied, claim preclusion prohibits either party from raising any claim or defense in the later action that was or coidd have been raised in support of or in opposition to the cause of action asserted in the prior action.” United States v.
