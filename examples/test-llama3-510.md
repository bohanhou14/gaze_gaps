This case, <RICHARD W. ROBERTS, District Judge>, presents a complex scenario where plaintiff Kabil Anton Djenasevic seeks relief under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, against various federal agencies. Djenasevic alleges that the agencies have maintained inaccurate information in his Inmate Central File, which has led to adverse decisions affecting his prison custody.

The court dismisses Djenasevic's claims, citing the Prison Litigation Reform Act's (PLRA) mandatory exhaustion requirement. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). The court finds that Djenasevic has not exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to his claims under the Privacy Act. Notably, the court references the Supreme Court's decision in Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002), which emphasizes the importance of proper exhaustion.

Moreover, the court concludes that Djenasevic fails to state a claim under the Privacy Act. Specifically, the court holds that the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) Inmate Central Records System is exempt from the amendment and accuracy provisions of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(2), (e)(5). This exemption, as stated in 28 C.F.R. § 16.97(a)(4), prohibits Djenasevic from seeking amendment or correction of the allegedly inaccurate records.

The court also dismisses Djenasevic's claim for damages, as he fails to meet the high standard of intentional or willful violation of the Privacy Act. See Toolasprashad v. Bureau of Prisons, 286 F.3d 576, 583 (D.C.Cir.2002); Albright v. United States, 732 F.2d 181, 189 (D.C.Cir.1984). In conclusion, the court's decision is guided by the principles outlined in cases such as 535 F.3d 697 and 333 F.3d 273, emphasizing the importance of exhaustion and the strict requirements for establishing a claim under the Privacy Act. <answer>

gold_text: To the extent that plaintiff alleges defendants' violations of rights protected by the United States Constitution, see Compl. at 2, these claims must be dismissed. The Privacy Act provides a comprehensive remedial scheme for a government agency’s failure to maintain records with the requisite level of accuracy or to amend such records. See Wilson v. Libby, 535 F.3d 697, 709-10 (D.C.Cir.2008) (comprehensive remedial scheme in Privacy Act precludes remedy for damages claim for constitutional violations under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971)); Chung v. United States Dep't of Justice, 333 F.3d 273, 274 (D.C.Cir.2003) (affirming “dismissal of Chung’s constitutional claims because, as the district court correctly held, they are encompassed within the remedial scheme of the Privacy Act”).
