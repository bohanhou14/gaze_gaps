Further clarification on the proper measurement of the pillar plate is guided by judicial construction in previous similar instances. The appellate court in United States v. Invicta Seeland, Inc., established that only the pillar or bottom plate should be measured (22 Cust. Ct. 95). Specifically, the ruling emphasized that measurements should exclude any parts not permanently attached to or part of the pillar plate, such as winding stems and shoulders, which are not integral to its function.

Moreover, the construction provided by these decisions aligns with the requirement that only the pillar plate's essential portion to the mechanismâ€™s functioning should be included (15 Cust. Ct. 124). This interpretation negates the plaintiff's contention that the synchronous motor, extending beyond the pillar plate, should be incorporated into the measurement. The precise directive is that all non-essential appendages should be omitted from the width determination.

Lastly, in the case of United States v. Levi Strauss & Co., the court reaffirmed the necessity to measure strictly the essential parts of the pillar plate, underscoring the exclusion of non-integral portions from the measurements (2 Cust. Ct. 249). Therefore, the imported time-keeping devices, having a pillar plate width of 1.32 inches without including the motor, fit within the statutory provisions, thus ensuring the collector's classification remains valid (35 Cust. Ct. 183).
