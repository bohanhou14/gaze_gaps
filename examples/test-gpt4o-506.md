VII.

In light of the principles established in the reference cases, it is evident that when a bankruptcy case converts from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, Chapter 7 administrative expenses are granted priority over Chapter 11 expenses. This is reinforced by 11 U.S.C. § 726(b), which explicitly provides this hierarchical prioritization (Reference case 32 B.R. 629; 28 B.R. 766; 19 B.R. 462). Specifically, in In re Price Chopper Supermarkets, Inc., 19 B.R. 462 (Bkrtcy.S.D.Cal.1982), and In re Rittenhouse, 76 B.R. 610 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1987), it was emphasized that Chapter 7 administrative expenses are given such priority to ensure that trustees and professionals are adequately incentivized to administer superseding cases.

VIII.

Given the retaining and subsequent allowance of fees to Stennett, Wilkinson, and Ward, and Knight and Knight, P.A., it is crucial to consider the nature of the retainers paid. As determined, these retainers constitute "security retainers," which implies that they secure payment of future services and remain property of the estate until applied to actually rendered services (Reference case 18 B.R. 292). Consequently, based on the amount of compensation approved, the retainers adequately secure the allowed fees within the constraints set by the Statute of Frauds.

IX.

Accordingly, Stennett, Wilkinson, and Ward are permitted to retain their entire $13,000.00 retainer, with the remaining balance of $5,464.30 to be treated as an administrative expense. Similarly, Knight and Knight, P.A. may retain $5,758.93 from their retainer, refunding the unsecured balance of $1,741.07 to the estate. This settlement adheres to the overarching principle that administrative expenses post-conversion under Chapter 7 hold superpriority over Chapter 11 administrative expenses (Reference case 32 B.R. 629; 28 B.R. 766).

IT IS SO ORDERED.
