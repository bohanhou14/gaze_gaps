The government has invoked several FOIA exemptions to withhold records, including Exemptions 7(A), 7(C), 7(D), and 7(F). The court must review the government's claims to ensure that the exemptions are properly invoked and that the records are not segregable.

Regarding Exemption 7(A), the FBI has claimed that the records are exempt because their disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. The court finds that the FBI has properly supported its claim, citing Bevis v. Dep't of State, 801 F.2d 1386 (D.C.Cir.1986). The FBI's declaration provides a detailed explanation of how the release of each category of documents could interfere with enforcement proceedings, and the court finds that the agency has met its burden of showing that all its records are exempt and relate to the continuing investigations of the sales and distribution of illegal narcotics.

Similarly, the DEA and the Customs Service have invoked Exemption 7(C) to withhold names and identifying information of law enforcement agents and support personnel. The court finds that the government has shown that the release of this information could reasonably be expected to cause an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, citing SafeCard Services, Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1205 (D.C.Cir.1991).

Regarding Exemption 7(D), the Customs Service has claimed that the records are exempt because they were compiled for law enforcement purposes and could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source. The court finds that the government has provided sufficient information to show that the Virginia State Police provided its records with the understanding that they would remain confidential, citing Londrigan v. FBI, 670 F.2d 1164, 1174 (D.C.Cir.1981).

Finally, the court finds that the Vaughn indices submitted by the DEA and the Customs Service are adequate, citing Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C.Cir.1973). The courts have consistently held that a Vaughn index is sufficient if it "sets out two broad categories within which these documents were placed, administrative materials and evidentiary matters, and eight types of material within the categories" (Goland v. CIA, 607 F.2d 339, 352 (D.C.Cir.1978)). The DEA's and the Customs Service

gold_text: An agency typically must submit an index identifying the documents withheld and the statutory exemption claimed. An adequate Vaughn index facilitates the trial court’s duty of ruling on the applicability of certain invoked FOIA exemptions, gives the requester as much information as possible that he may use to present his case to the trial court and thus enables the adversary system to operate. Lykins v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 725 F.2d 1455, 1463 (D.C.Cir.1984). “[I]t is the function, not the form, of the index that is important.” Keys v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 830 F.2d 337, 349 (D.C.Cir.1987) (citations omitted). So long as the Vaughn index and supporting government affidavits are sufficiently specific to support the exemptions claimed, the agency need not submit an index with “a degree of detail that would reveal precisely the information that the agency claims it is entitled to withhold.” Id.
