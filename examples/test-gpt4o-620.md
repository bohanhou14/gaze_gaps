As established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII requires proof that: (i) the complainant belongs to a protected class, (ii) the complainant was qualified and applied for a position, (iii) the complainant faced rejection despite qualifications, and (iv) the position remained open with continued applicant searches. Given this framework (524 F.2d 1058), plaintiff fails to establish elements (ii) and (iii) due to lacking qualifications and not formally applying for the branch manager position.

Further, in the context of Title VII claims, once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the employment decision (514 F.2d 651). Here, defendant justified the termination based on plaintiff's poor computer skills, frequent absences, and interpersonal issues with colleagues. The plaintiff did not demonstrate that these reasons were mere pretexts for gender discrimination.

Additionally, the advertisement for the assistant branch manager, albeit appearing in the "HELP WANTED-MEN, BOYS" column by the newspaper’s choice, does not alone establish discriminatory intent absent evidence that defendant directed such placement. Consequently, no violation is found based on advertisement placement.

Given the plaintiff’s failure to timely file charges within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act, as per 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5, and absence of continuous discriminatory practice, this Court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the discrimination claims. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 798.

In sum, the evidence supports that plaintiff was not qualified for the managerial role, and her termination was supported by legitimate concerns unrelated to her gender. Therefore, the claims of sex discrimination fail for lack of both jurisdiction and merit.

gold_text: Assuming arguendo that jurisdiction exists over defendant’s failure to promote plaintiff, the Court concludes that the failure to promote was not the result, in whole or in part, of discrimination on the basis of sex. To establish a prima facie case, plaintiff must show that she applied for and was qualified for the position available; that the employer rejected plaintiff despite her qualifications; and that “the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant’s qualifications”.
