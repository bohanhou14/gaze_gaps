The case at bar involves the admission of evidence in a conspiracy trial. The government's attorney read the Illinois statutes to the jury, and the defendant's attorneys read a portion of the law that was not complained of by the government. The court unduly restricted the defendant's counsel in their cross-examination of government witnesses, as they were not allowed to ask questions that were deemed to be argumentative.

The court also admitted evidence of acts done by Harvey, or by Harvey and Warner, acting with other persons not named in the indictment. The court held that this evidence was admissible because it was part of the conspiracy already shown, and the acts were done in execution of the conspiracy charged. The court also admitted evidence of a raid on Folci's restaurant, which was part of the general conspiracy.

The court further admitted evidence of a transaction in which Warner, Harvey, and another agent followed a stranger into a tailoring shop and found liquor on the stranger. Goosey, the owner of the shop, went with the agent to a bank and paid him a bribe. The court held that this evidence was admissible because it was part of the conspiracy already shown.

In conclusion, the court's admission of evidence in this case was proper. The evidence was relevant and tended to prove the conspiracy charged. The court's restriction on the defendant's counsel in their cross-examination was not error, as the witnesses' testimony was already discrediting. The court's admission of evidence of acts done by Harvey and Warner was proper, as it was part of the conspiracy already shown.

gold_text: 6. Objection is made that the court improperly restricted cross-examination of certain witnesses by the defendants’ counsel. This is a matter in which the trial judge must necessarily be given a wide discretion, and particularly, where there are several defendants represented by several attorneys. Jelke v. United States, 255 F. 264 (C. C. A. 7); Fire Ass’n of Phila. v. Oneida County Macaroni Co., 294 F. 633, 639 (C. C. A. 2). We find no abuse of the discretion in the record before us.
