In light of the foregoing, it is evident that the injury to the plaintiff, while aboard a moored riverboat casino on navigable waters, falls under the admiralty jurisdiction as delineated by federal statutes and precedent cases. The facts of this case, involving an accident on a commercial vessel, draw a clear parallel to cases like *Reference Case 121 F.3d 1421*, where federal maritime law has been ruled as applicable due to the substantial connection with maritime activity and disruption to maritime commerce.

Moreover, the principles elucidated in *Reference Case 912 F.2d 1355* show that ownership and responsibility for maintenance of the vessel (or its components) can impute liability, as demonstrated by Carnival’s case. Here, the defendant’s maintenance of the slot machine stool aligns with the imputed duty of care in *912 F.2d 1355*.

Finally, addressing jurisdiction issues as seen in *Reference Case 829 F.2d 1399*, which dealt with implicit appearances and claims, further buttresses the argument that traditional maritime activity implicates federal jurisdiction regardless of procedural nuances. Therefore, given the riverboat's status and the nature of the plaintiff's injury — on navigable waters and linked to an appurtenance of the vessel — the admiralty jurisdiction is indeed applicable in this case, overruling the district court's dismissal.

gold_text: We say “slightly” better because the tort principles applied to maritime accidents that as in this case mirror terrestrial accidents are similar. But this is not to deny the significance of different limitations periods and a different factfinder (judge versus jury). And while these differences are to an extent offsetting — the longer statutory period favors the plaintiff but the denial of jury trial favors the defendant — others may not be. We summa rize them briefly: (1) Nonpeeuniary damages are generally disallowed in personal-injury suits under admiralty law. Robert Force, “Tort Reform by the Judiciary: Developments in the Law of Maritime Personal Injury and Death Damages,” 23 Tulane Maritime L.J. 351, 361 (1999); see, e.g., In re Amtrack “Sunset Limited” Train Crash, 121 F.3d 1421, 1429 (11th Cir.1997). (2) A shipowner owes a uniform duty of care to everyone lawfully on board his ship, whereas some states still impose different standards of care on landowners with respect to different classes of visitors, such as business invitees and licensees. Kermarec v. Compagnie Generate Transatlantique, supra, 358 U.S. at 630, 79 S.Ct. 406; Everett v. Carnival Cruise Lines, 912 F.2d 1355, 1358 (11th Cir.1990). (3) Admiralty tort plaintiffs can sue the vessel itself even when the owner has no liability. 2 Thomas J. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law § 21-3 (4th ed.2004); see, e.g., United States v. Republic Marine, Inc., 829 F.2d 1399, 1400-01 (7th Cir.1987). (4) The Limitation of Shipowners’ Liability Act, 46 U.S.CApp. § 181, generally limits a shipowner’s liability to the value of his investment in the vessel and freight, other than in personal-injury or wrongful-death actions.
