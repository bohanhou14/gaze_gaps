It is essential to address the defense's reliance on precedent regarding the disqualification of counsel due to past representation. As highlighted in 125 F.2d 147, the guiding principle revolves around whether the matters involved in the prior and current representation are substantially related. In the instant case, this relationship is sufficiently demonstrated given Cooke's deep involvement in the Paramount litigation, which directly aligns with the subject matter of the current case. This mirrors the situation in the aforementioned reference where prior representation dictated the issues of the case at hand.

Further, as upheld in 286 F. 994, it is established that a court's power to disqualify an attorney does not hinge solely on disbarment rules but extends to preserving the integrity of the legal process. This precedent reaffirms the justification for disqualifying Cooke despite lacking direct evidence of him sharing confidential information, as the mere potential of compromised loyalty suffices. The emphasis in both cases on maintaining absolute attorney-client confidentiality underscores the Court's approach in this matter.

Given these precedents, it becomes apparent that the motion to disqualify Cooke aligns cohesively with the principles established by prior judicial determinations to safeguard confidential information and upholding ethical standards.
