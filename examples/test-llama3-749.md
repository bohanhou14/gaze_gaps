You are considering legal cases as references, specifically 178 F.3d 804 and 149 F.3d 413. Based on these cases, it appears that the district court's judgment is subject to appeal. In 178 F.3d 804, the court ruled that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to alter its prior judgment dismissing the action, citing McCullough Transfer Co. v. Virginia Surety Co., 213 F.2d 440, 442-43 (6th Cir.1954). Similarly, in 149 F.3d 413, the court found that the district court's denial of a motion to alter or amend was not an abuse of discretion, citing Bud Brooks Trucking, Inc. v. Bill Hodges Trucking Co., 909 F.2d 1437, 1440 (10th Cir.1990).

In the case at hand, the district court's denial of O'Bryan's motion to alter or amend is subject to appeal. As per 149 F.3d 413, the court should review the denial of the motion to alter or amend to determine whether it was an abuse of discretion. In this case, the district court denied O'Bryan's motion to alter or amend based on new evidence, concluding that the evidence was previously available and would not have produced a different result. This finding is supported by 178 F.3d 804, where the court ruled that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to alter its prior judgment dismissing the action.

In conclusion, the district court's denial of O'Bryan's motion to alter or amend is subject to appeal. The court should review the denial of the motion to alter or amend to determine whether it was an abuse of discretion. The district court's finding that the new evidence was previously available and would not have produced a different result is supported by 178 F.3d 804.

gold_text: O’Bryan also appeals the district court’s denial of his motion to alter or amend based on the evidence submitted concerning Dr. Hopkins. However, the district court properly concluded that this evidence was previously available to O’Bryan, see GenCorp, Inc. v. Am. Int’l Underwriters, 178 F.3d 804, 834 (6th Cir.1999), and would not have produced a different result. See Good v. Ohio Edison Co., 149 F.3d 413, 423 (6th Cir.1998).
