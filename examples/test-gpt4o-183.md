Middlebrook's restitution argument centers on the premise that the court failed to base its restitution order on actual losses incurred by the victims, as mandated by United States v. Genova, 333 F.3d 750, 761, 762 (7th Cir.2003) and clarified further in United States v. Rhodes, 330 F.3d 949, 953 (7th Cir. 2003) (536 F.3d 584). Middlebrook asserts that because his net worth was negative at the time of the bankruptcy and he lacked the means to repay the shareholder note or the distributions, the financial instruments in question were worthless, thus causing no actual loss. He regards the $9,688 insurance refund as the sole quantifiable harm resulting from his fraudulent actions.

However, as seen in United States v. Wolf, 90 F.3d 191 (7th Cir. 1996), restitution must reflect the "actual loss" caused by the defendant's offense, and the district court is prohibited from ordering restitution in excess of the victim’s actual damages. This principle underscores that restitution should not surpass the calculated harm experienced by the creditors due to the fraudulent activities.

Although Middlebrook contends that the non-disclosed shareholder note and distributions were valueless and hence did not cause real loss, the government presented substantial evidence at trial showing that these misrepresented assets were crucial in demonstrating his fraudulent intent. The district court appropriately considered these values, in line with the principles delineated in the relevant case law, thereby grounding its restitution figure in the perceived harm Middlebrook intended.

Given these considerations and the substantial evidence supporting the district court's calculations, Middlebrook's plea to reduce the restitution amount is unpersuasive. The restitution of $1,590,190 stands as reflective of the intended and inferred losses to the creditors due to his fraud.

Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the restitution order.
