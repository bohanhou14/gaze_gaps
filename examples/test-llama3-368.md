ORDER
The court has reviewed defendant's motion to stay the production of certain documents pending further appellate review. Defendant claims that it is likely to succeed on the merits, will be irreparably injured absent a stay, and that issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding. The court disagrees.

Firstly, defendant has not shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits. The Federal Circuit has already denied defendant's petition for mandamus, upholding this court's application of the fiduciary exception to the documents at issue. In re United States, 590 F.3d 1305 (Fed.Cir.2009). Further review is unlikely to alter the outcome.

Secondly, defendant has not demonstrated irreparable harm. The court has ordered defendant to produce the documents under a Confidentiality Agreement and Protective Order, which limits the use and further disclosure of records produced in this action. Defendant can easily remedy any potential harm by seeking relief under Federal Rule of Evidence 502(d).

Thirdly, the court finds that other parties will be substantially injured if the stay is granted. The documents at issue have been withheld for an extraordinarily long time, and their production is crucial to the resolution of this case and other similar cases. Further delay will only exacerbate the problems.

Lastly, the court notes that the public interest lies in favor of moving forward, as the precedents developed in this case will aid the resolution of more than ninety similar cases pending before this court.

In light of these considerations, the court denies defendant's motion to stay the production of the documents. The court will, however, extend the deadline for production to permit defendant time to file a petition for rehearing with the Federal Circuit. The documents must be produced by February 17, 2010. The court's order denying defendant's motion is consistent with the principles set forth in cases such as 406 F.3d 867, 951 F.2d 1414, 723 F.2d 1461, 676 F.2d 793, 573 F.2d 646, 182 F.R.D. 182, and 135 F.R.D. 94.

ORDERED.
