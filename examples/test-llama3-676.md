The case of Spencer and Mary Stewart involves two transactions: the sale of a water utility system and the sale of securities. The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service determined a deficiency in their 1969 and 1970 tax returns and the Stewarts paid the deficiencies and sued for a refund.

The first issue is whether the interest paid by the City of Phoenix on the deferred payment of the purchase price of the water utility system is exempt from federal income tax under Internal Revenue Code § 103(a)(1). Referring to the case of Kings County Development Co. v. Commissioner, 219 F.2d 523, the court held that the interest paid was not exempt as it was not equivalent to that paid under a legal obligation in connection with a condemnation action.

The second issue is whether the Stewarts were entitled to deduct a proportion of the cost of the utility system from each installment payment received in 1969, even though they had erroneously deducted more than the entire cost in 1968. The court held that the Stewarts were not entitled to deduct more than the full basis, citing the case of Commissioner v. Laguna Land & Water Co., 118 F.2d 112, and Robinson v. Commissioner, 181 F.2d 17.

The third issue is whether the Stewarts were entitled to report income on a sale of stock to a corporation under the installment sales method, even though Spencer Stewart effectively controlled the corporation and the corporation used the stock to pay off a loan he had guaranteed. The court held that the corporation was not a "mere conduit" and the Stewarts were entitled to use the installment sales method, citing the case of Lustgarten v. Commissioner, 639 F.2d 1208, and Roberts v. Commissioner, 643 F.2d 654.

In conclusion, the court's decisions on these issues have important implications for taxpayers who engage in installment sales and for the Commissioner's ability to adjust tax liabilities. The cases highlight the importance of careful planning and documentation in installment sales, as well as the need for the Commissioner to strictly adhere to the statute of limitations in adjusting tax liabilities.

gold_text: The district court applied the rule expressed in Roberts, and concluded that Stewart did not have control over the proceeds of the sale because the bank, and not SPM, had sold the stock. The district court noted, “if the only intermediary involved were SPM, and if SPM had sold the stock on the market the defendant’s arguments would possibly have merit.” Thus, the bank played a role similar to that of the trust in Roberts. We find no basis for reversing the district court’s determination. Cases in which the taxpayer has been denied use of installment treatment on the “conduit” theory are ones in which the taxpayer had control of the proceeds, subject only to self-imposed restrictions. See, e.g., Lustgarten v. Commissioner, 639 F.2d 1208 (5th Cir.1981) (taxpayer could not use installment reporting for sale of stock to son because, through a series of agreements with the son, he effectively controlled the sale of the stock, the reinvestment of the proceeds in the mutual fund and the placing, of those shares in escrow); Williams v. United States, 219 F.2d 523 (5th Cir.1955) (self-imposed restriction, created when the taxpayer sold some property and had part of the price placed in escrow to be paid out in installments, did not change the fact that, at the time of the sale, the taxpayer had constructively received the entire payment).
