The case at hand revolves around the United States Department of Defense's (DoD) challenge to the Alaska Public Utilities Commission's (APUC) imposition of costs associated with rate setting hearings. The DoD argues that the imposition of costs is unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause and violates the Anti-Deficiency Act.

In support of its claim, the DoD relies on the case of Mayo v. United States (319 U.S. 441, 63 S.Ct. 1137, 87 L.Ed. 1504 (1943)), which held that a state's imposition of fees on the federal government is unconstitutional. The DoD also cites United States v. State of Montana (699 F.Supp. 835 (D.Mont.1988)), which found that a state's fee requirements were invalid as against the United States.

The court must consider the precedent set in Watkins v. United States Army (875 F.2d 699 (9th Cir.1989)), which established that the government will not be estopped unless it engaged in affirmative misconduct beyond mere negligence. In this case, the DoD's initial agreement to contribute to the costs of the rate setting hearing and subsequent refusal to do so does not amount to affirmative misconduct.

Furthermore, the court must consider the holding in Richmond v. Office of Personnel Management (496 U.S. 414, 110 S.Ct. 2465, 110 L.Ed.2d 387 (1990)), which stated that the government will not be estopped for money in violation of a statute. The DoD's refusal to pay costs is not a violation of a statute, but rather a dispute over the application of a state law.

In conclusion, the court finds that the APUC's imposition of costs is unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause and violates the Anti-Deficiency Act. The DoD's refusal to pay costs is not a violation of a statute, but rather a dispute over the application of a state law. The court grants the DoD's motion for summary judgment and denies the APUC's motion for summary judgment.
