In deciding whether to transfer I.R. for adult prosecution, the district court carefully weighed the six statutory factors as laid out in 18 U.S.C. § 5032. Its decision to deny the transfer was guided by considerations similar to those addressed in United States v. Doe, 871 F.2d 1248, where factors (2) through (5) weighed heavily in favor of transfer, while Factor (6) slightly opposed it. Likewise, in the present case, the district court recognized the seriousness of I.R.’s offense and his extensive delinquency record but emphasized the lack of past effective treatment efforts and potential for rehabilitation.

The government contended that the district court failed to properly consider all statutory factors, paralleling arguments in Romulus, 949 F.2d 713, where the court’s omission in making specific findings on intellectual development and available programs warranted a remand. However, unlike Romulus, the district court here made detailed findings on each factor, including I.R.’s social background, psychological maturity, and potential for treatment, and supported its decision with substantial evidence.

Ultimately, the district court found that despite the compelling nature of some factors favoring transfer, the interests of justice and rehabilitation as aimed by the federal juvenile system, as discussed in earlier cases, weighed against prosecuting I.R. as an adult. Therefore, this Court finds no abuse of discretion and affirms the district court's denial of the government’s motion to transfer.

gold_text: In deciding whether to transfer an action, the district court must consider and make findings on the record with respect to the six statutory factors described above. See 18 U.S.C. § 5032. The district court is not required to afford equal weight to each factor, but instead may balance them as it deems appropriate. See United States v. Doe, 871 F.2d 1248, 1254-55 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 917, 110 S.Ct. 276, 107 L.Ed.2d 257 (1989); Alexander, 695 F.2d at 400-01. The district court must make factual findings sufficient to permit meaningful appellate review. See United States v. Romulus, 949 F.2d 713, 715-16 (4th Cir.1991), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 1690, 118 L.Ed.2d 403 (1992).
