Drawing on the precedent set by DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services (489 U.S. 189), we recognize that the general principle is that the Constitution does not impose a duty on the State to protect individuals from private violence. However, unlike DeShaney, where the child remained in the father's custody for a significant period, here, the officers took affirmative actions that potentially created or enhanced the danger to Sinthasomphone. This factual distinction places the case closer to Ross v. United States (910 F.2d 1422), where the deputy’s actions prevented others from undertaking a rescue, thereby imposing a constitutional violation.

The case's complexity is deepened by comparing it to Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976), which articulates the "deliberate indifference" standard under § 1983 in the context of prisoners’ Eighth Amendment rights. As in Estelle, the officers here allegedly demonstrated deliberate indifference to Sinthasomphone's dire condition and the information provided by concerned citizens. Furthermore, this case also resonates with the principles from Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), where the Court acknowledged a substantive due process right to safe conditions in state custody. Although Sinthasomphone wasn’t in prolonged state custody, the transient nature of police intervention could still meet the threshold for a “special relationship.”

Moreover, in addressing the City's policies, the argument extends to systemic discrimination akin to the claims in cases like Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967), which permit evaluating the broader municipal practices under § 1983. Lastly, juxtaposing with Harris v. District of Columbia, 932 F.2d 10 (1991), highlights that while no formal custodial relationship existed before police intervention, the officers' actions in assuming custody—even temporarily—and delivering Sinthasomphone back to Dahmer significantly escalated the risk to his life.

gold_text: Outside of prisons [Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)] or mental institutions [Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982) ] courts have been reluctant to find special relationships. For example, in Harris v. District of Columbia, 932 F.2d 10 (D.C.Cir.1991), the court considered whether police officers had a qualified immunity from suit. The officers took Derrick D. Harris into custody. He was suffering severe effects from an overdose of PCP. There was a delay in getting him admitted to a hospital and he died. The court determined that the police officers were not under “a clearly established constitutional obligation to obtain medical care for Harris” based on a special relationship with him and that they therefore were entitled to a qualified immunity. The majority opinion indicated, however, that they were deciding the qualified immunity issue: whether an obligation was “clearly established,” not whether a constitutional obligation existed. A fine point, and one which will no doubt arise again in this case.
