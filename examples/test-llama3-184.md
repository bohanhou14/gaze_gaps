In the case of 705 F.3d 770, the court held that the district court erred in decertifying the class after the parties settled. Similarly, in 564 F.3d 1256, the court held that the district court should have considered the relevant factors before decertifying the class. In the present case, the court finds that the similarities between the plaintiffs, such as the same job responsibilities, pay structure, and encouragement of overtime work, outweigh the differences, including the statute of limitations, credibility, and varying managerial practices.

The court also notes that the plaintiffs' interrogatory responses reveal a consistent pattern of managers encouraging overtime work to meet sales quotas, despite some individualized differences in managerial practices. This suggests that liability can be established on a class-wide basis, as required by the FLSA.

In light of these findings, the court denies Defendant's motion for decertification. The court believes that a collective action is still appropriate, as the similarities between the plaintiffs outweigh the differences, and liability can be established on a class-wide basis.

The court also notes that the FLSA is a remedial statute that should be liberally construed, as stated in Morgan v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc., 551 F.3d 1233, 1264-65 (11th Cir. 2008). Therefore, the court should be cautious in decertifying the class, especially when the plaintiffs have established a reasonable basis for their claims.

In conclusion, the court finds that the collective action should proceed, as the similarities between the plaintiffs outweigh the differences, and liability can be established on a class-wide basis. The court denies Defendant's motion for decertification and allows the collective action to continue.

gold_text: Although the court has denied Defendantâ€™s motion for decertification, the parties apparently anticipate filing motions for summary judgment. It is possible that as the parties develop further evidence and potentially narrow liability ' issues, the court might have a different view of the suitability of a collective action. After resolution of any motions for summary judgment, if necessary, the court may require the parties to file trial briefs outlining the manner in which they intend to try/ defend the case before the jury. See, e.g., Espenscheid v. DirectSat USA, LLC, 705 F.3d 770, 775-76. (7th Cir.2013) (Posner, J.) (FLSA case); Vega v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 564 F.3d 1256, 1278-79 & n. 20 (11th Cir.2009) (Rule 23 class)
