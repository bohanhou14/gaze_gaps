In the case at hand, the appellant argues that the tie vote provision in 19 U.S.C. 160(a) violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment. The provision states that the Commission shall be deemed to have made an affirmative determination if the commissioners voting are evenly divided on the question. The appellant contends that this provision allows for the imposition of dumping duties without due process of law, as it does not require a majority vote.

In Berkey Technical Corp. v. United States, 71 Cust. Ct. 275, C.R.D. 73-27, 380 F. Supp. 786 (1973), the court held that pleadings should be read in light of the allegations, which specify a failure of evidence to support the finding. Similarly, in this case, the allegations in the complaint specify a failure of due process, which is raised for the first time in a post-trial brief.

The court in Miller, 83 Cust. Ct. 97, C.D. 4825, 484 F. Supp. 901 (1979), followed the rule that issues raised for the first time on appeal are not considered. However, the court also recognized that in exceptional circumstances, the court may consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal. In this case, the issue of due process is of significant importance, and considering it would not cause any prejudice to the respondent.

Furthermore, the court in Aronoff Galleries, Inc. v. United States, 1 Cust. Ct. 225, C.D. 51 (1938), held that where the pleadings contain no statement that the suit is one which involves a controversy over a constitutional right, the question is not before the court. However, in this case, the appellant has raised a constitutional question, and the court should consider it.

In conclusion, the court should consider the appellant's argument that the tie vote provision in 19 U.S.C. 160(a) violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment. The provision does not require a majority vote, which could lead to the imposition of dumping duties without due process of law. Considering this issue would not cause any prejudice to the respondent, and it is an important question that should be addressed. <answer>
