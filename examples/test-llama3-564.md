 OPINION

The court's decision to impose a 96-month sentence on Carthen, who was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, was substantively reasonable. While Carthen's difficult childhood and ongoing medical and mental health issues were considered, the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting his argument for a downward variance.

The court's consideration of Carthen's medical needs is supported by United States v. Clark, 469 F.3d 568, 571 (6th Cir.2006), which held that a district court's refusal to vary downward from the guideline range due to a defendant's medical condition was not an abuse of discretion. Similarly, in United States v. Carpenter, 359 Fed.Appx. 553, 558 (6th Cir.2009) (unpublished opinion), the court found that a district court's refusal to vary downward from the guideline range due to a defendant's medical condition was not an abuse of discretion.

The court's decision to bring federal charges against Carthen, rather than state charges, was appropriate. United States v. Allen, 954 F.2d 1160 (6th Cir.1992), held that the decision to bring federal charges against a defendant was not arbitrary or capricious, even if the defendant would have faced a shorter sentence in state court.

In United States v. Gale, 510 F.3d 603 (6th Cir.2007), the court held that a district court's decision to impose a sentence within the guideline range was not an abuse of discretion, even if the defendant argued that the sentence was excessive.

The court's decision to impose a 96-month sentence on Carthen was substantively reasonable, considering the seriousness of the offense, Carthen's criminal history, and the need to protect the public. The court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Carthen's argument for a downward variance, and the decision to bring federal charges against Carthen was appropriate. The court's consideration of Carthen's medical needs was supported by United States v. Clark and United States v. Carpenter.

Allen, 954 F.2d 1160, 1166 (6th Cir.1992). When a prosecutor has probable cause to believe that an accused has committed an offense defined by statute, “decisions regarding whether to prosecute and what charges to file generally rest within the prosecutor’s discretion.” United States v. Brimite, 102 Fed.Appx. 952, 955 (6th Cir.2004) (unpublished opinion); see also Allen, 954 F.2d at 1166. The baseline for judging selective prosecutions is whether decisions to file and pursue charges were based on a defendant’s race, sex, religion, or exercise of a statutory or constitutional right. Allen, 954 F.2d at 1166.
