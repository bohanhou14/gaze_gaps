A.W. also contends that the defendants violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by denying him appropriate procedural safeguards. In assessing claims of due process violations, courts differentiate between procedural and substantive due process. Procedural due process concerns whether proper procedures were followed, whereas substantive due process examines whether the government's action was arbitrary or capricious (31 F.3d 1191).

In this case, A.W. claims both procedural and substantive due process violations. However, as established in prior cases, procedural due process requires only that a party receives notice and an opportunity to be heard (6 F.3d 290). The denial of a grievance hearing by the state hearing officer can be analyzed under procedural due process. The factors include the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation, and the government's interests (Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319). Given the opportunity for filing memoranda and the preconference hearing provided, the process appears to align with minimal due process requirements.

Substantive due process claims necessitate demonstrating that the government's actions were not just incorrect but egregiously wrong, without a rational connection to legitimate state interests (935 F.2d 507). Here, A.W. failed to allege that the defendants' actions were arbitrary or capricious or that they acted with gross misjudgment or bad faith — the standards required for a substantive due process claim.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence and aligned with the standards set forth in the relevant precedents, summary judgment is GRANTED in favor of Elmcrest and the State Defendants on A.W.’s due process claim.

gold_text: In Count Two, A.W. asserts that the defendants denied him substantive and procedural due process in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. In order to make out a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff must (1) identify a property right, (2) demonstrate that he was deprived of that right, and (3) show that the denial was achieved without due process. See Local 342, Pub. Serv. Employees v. Huntington, 31 F.3d 1191, 1194 (2d Cir.1994) (citation omitted). To support a substantive due process claim, A.W. must identify a property interest and explain how it has been interfered with by the government. See Greene v. Town of Blooming Grove, 935 F.2d 507 (2d Cir.1991). He must also allege that this deprivation was arbitrary or not reasonably related to a legitimate government interest. See Williams v. Texas Tech. Univ. Health Sciences Ctr., 6 F.3d 290, 294 (5th Cir.1993).
