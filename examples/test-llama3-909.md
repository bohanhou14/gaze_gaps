Mid South claims that Wyant posed a direct threat to the health and safety of others in the workplace. To establish a direct threat, an employer must show that an employee's impairment substantially limits a major life activity and poses a significant risk of harm to oneself or others. Turco v. Hilton Hotels, 920 F.2d 311, 315 (5th Cir. 1991). The employer must also demonstrate that the risk cannot be reduced to a non-significant level through reasonable accommodations. Id.

In this case, Mid South relies on Landry's testimony that Wyant was not performing his job duties safely

gold_text: "[A]n individual is not qualified for a job if there is a genuine substantial risk that he or she could be injured or could injure others, and the employer cannot modify the job to eliminate the risk." Chiari v. City of League City , 920 F.2d 311, 317 (5th Cir. 1991). The ADA allows qualification standards that "include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace" and defines a "direct threat" as a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation." Turco v. Hoechst Celanese Corp. , 101 F.3d 1090, 1094 (5th Cir. 1996)
