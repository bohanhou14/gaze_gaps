Jones contends that the prosecutor’s comments during closing arguments improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defense. He argues that these comments violated his right to a fair trial by suggesting that he had an obligation to produce evidence or call witnesses, such as Detective Maples, to rebut the prosecution’s case. 

Under a plain error standard of review, as Jones did not contemporaneously object to this specific comment during the trial, we examine whether the prosecutor’s comments were both improper and prejudicial. In United States v. Endicott, 803 F.2d 506, 513 (9th Cir. 1986), the court noted that plain error is established when the error is highly prejudicial and affects substantial rights (868 F.2d 1097).

Here, the prosecutor’s remarks must be analyzed to determine if they misled the jury about the burden of proof, which remains with the government at all times (990 F.2d 507). This is consistent with our previous analyses in cases concerning prosecutorial misconduct and its potential impact on a defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent (United States v. Castillo, 866 F.2d 1071, 1083 (9th Cir.1989)).

Considering the totality of the circumstances, including the trial court's instructions to the jury about the burden of proof, we conclude that the prosecutor’s comments, while perhaps inartful, did not result in plain error. Therefore, Jones’s claim that he was denied a fair trial due to these comments is without merit.
