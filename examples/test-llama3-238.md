MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
This matter is before the court on the Secretary of Health and Human Services’ motion for an order affirming the Secretary’s decision denying plaintiff Social Security disability benefits. Plaintiff has filed a motion for summary judgment seeking reversal of the Secretary’s decision.

In Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971), the Supreme Court held that substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla and is “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.”

At the time of the administrative hearing, plaintiff was 51 years of age. The Social Security Administration referred plaintiff to various medical professionals, including Dr. Clough, Dr. Fine, and Dr. Buser. Dr. Clough’s final diagnosis was lumbar spondylosis with chronic low back strain. Dr. Fine’s psychological evaluation revealed that plaintiff had an I.Q. score of 82 and had difficulty with verbal expression and reasoning. Dr. Buser’s physical examination revealed that plaintiff had a history of low back pain that radiated into the legs and up the upper back.

In this case, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the plaintiff’s claims of disabling pain. The medical evidence establishes that plaintiff has severe impairments consisting of a status post low back surgery with residuals exacerbated by subsequent low back injury. The medical records clearly support plaintiff’s testimony regarding the pain he suffers.

Finally, we note that the case of Dvorak v. Celebrezze, 345 F.2d 894, 897 (10th Cir. 1965), holds that the purpose of the Social Security Act is to ameliorate some of the rigors of life for the disabled.

This court therefore reverses the Secretary’s decision and remands the case to the Secretary with directions to reinstate the prior status of the plaintiff-appellant, in light of the substantial evidence supporting the plaintiff’s claims of disabling pain. The case of Holloway v. Heckler, 607 F.Supp. 71, 72 (D.Kan. 1985), is instructive in this regard.

gold_text: The AU also determined that the plaintiff’s testimony concerning his daily activities did not support plaintiff’s claim of pain. According to the AU, the fact that plaintiff admitted to working on his car, sometimes doing the grocery shopping, visiting with his father, watching TV and going fishing, indicated that plaintiff’s pain was not so extreme as to significantly interfere with his normal everyday activities or prevent plaintiff from working. We must disagree. These activities do not involve prolonged physical activity and are not inconsistent with plaintiff’s complaints of pain. It is well established that sporadic diversions, such as performing a few household tasks and working on cars, do not establish that a person is capable of engaging in substantial gainful activity and may not form the basis for rejecting a claimant’s objective complaints of pain. Byron v. Heckler, 742 F.2d 1232, 1235 (10th Cir.1984); Broadbent v. Harris, 698 F.2d 407, 413 (10th Cir.1983). In sum, we conclude that substantial evidence does not support the AU’s rejection of plaintiff’s claims of disabling pain.
