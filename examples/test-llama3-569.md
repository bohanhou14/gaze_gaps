The case 441 U.S. 347 discusses the admissibility of a statement made by a decedent in a wrongful death action. The court held that the residual exception to the hearsay rule, Rules 803(24) and 804(b)(5), allows the admission of the statement if it has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. In this case, the statement was made by Huff, the decedent, to his friend Myles, two or three days after the accident. The court found that the statement had equivalent guarantees of trustworthiness, including the fact that it was an unambiguous and explicit report of the events, and that there was no reason for Huff to invent the story of the preexisting fire in the cab.

Regarding the excessiveness of the verdict, the court held that the verdict of $700,000 was not grossly excessive or monstrous. Although the court would have awarded a different amount, it is not the role of the court to disturb the verdict unless it is grossly excessive.

Finally, the court held that Indiana's wrongful death statute, Ind. Code Ann. § 34-1-1-2, does not authorize punitive damages. The court concluded that the amendment to

gold_text: Plaintiff alternatively contends that if § 34-1-1-2 does not allow punitive damages it violates the equal protection clauses of the United States and Indiana Constitutions by discriminating against wrongful death claimants and in favor of other personal injury and property damage plaintiffs, who are permitted to recover punitive damages. This contention is without merit. The legislative classification, involving neither race nor ‘certain other immutable human attributes,” does not constitute invidious discrimination. See Parham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347, 351, 99 S.Ct. 1742, 1745, 60 L.Ed.2d 269 (1979). Nor does it affect fundamental rights. See id. at 1749 n.12. Therefore § 34-1-1-2 “is entitled to a presumption of validity and will be upheld ‘unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legislative purposes that we can only conclude that the legislature’s actions were irrational.’ ” Id. at 1746 (quoting Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97, 99 S.Ct. 939, 943, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979)). Plaintiff has not persuaded us that the adoption of § 34 — 1-1-2 without a provision authorizing awards of punitive damages was irrational. See Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 110-111, 99 S.Ct. 939, 950, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979). We agree with the First Circuit’s holding that such a provision does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Cyr v. B. Of fen & Co., 501 F.2d 1145, 1148-1149 n.2 (1974).
