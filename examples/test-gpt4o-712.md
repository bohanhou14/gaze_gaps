Earthgrains further imposed a gag rule prohibiting Union discussions and possession of Union literature. The gag rule was clearly restrictive as it prevented employees from discussing Union matters during work hours and only allowed such discussions in nonwork areas and during breaks. This is consistent with unlawful interference as highlighted in the reference case 263 F.3d 345, where distributing union literature in nonwork areas during nonwork time is protected under § 7 of the NLRA.

Moreover, forbidding the possession of Union literature violated established protections. In the reference case 324 U.S. 793, it is noted that disallowing Union-related materials on company property infringes on employees' rights under § 7. Earthgrains’ actions in stopping Crider from displaying Union literature and instructing him to remove it by a specific timeframe mirror these prohibitive actions.

In conclusion, Earthgrains’ implementation of a gag rule and prohibition of Union paraphernalia reflect direct violations of § 8(a)(1) of the NLRA, aligning with findings from reference cases 263 F.3d 345 and 324 U.S. 793. These actions amounted to coercive interference, supporting the Board’s determinations and reinforcing the need for enforcement of the remedial order.

gold_text: Soliciting support for a union and distributing union literature are two essential activities protected by the NLRA. Consol. Diesel Co. v. NLRB, 263 F.3d 345, 352 (4th Cir.2001). Furthermore, “the workplace is ‘uniquely appropriate’ for such activities, so long as the activities are conducted in nonwork areas during nonwork time and in a non-abusive manner.” Id. at 352 (quoting Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U.S. 793, 801 n. 6, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945) (internal citations omitted)). Thus, no-solicitation and no-distribution rules can be valid in the workplace, provided that they are not selectively applied against pro-union activity and do not spring up only when union activities begin. Opryland Hotel, 323 N.L.R.B. 723, 728-29 (1997).
