ORDER
SEYBERT, District Judge:

Plaintiffs Catcove Corp. and Dede Gotthelf (collectively, "Plaintiffs") have filed an amended complaint alleging that Defendants Town of Southampton, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ("DEC"), and individual defendants violated 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985, 1988 by failing to approve zoning changes that would have facilitated Plaintiffs' proposed commercial development.

In considering Defendants' motions to dismiss, the Court applies a "plausibility standard," guided by two working principles: (1) the Court must accept all allegations as true, but (2) a complaint that states a "plausible claim for relief" can survive a motion to dismiss. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, — U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009).

The Court notes that Plaintiffs' "class of one" equal protection claim (73 F.3d 1253) and gender discrimination claim (762 F.2d 243) are not plausible. Additionally, Plaintiffs' procedural due process claim (290 F.3d 118) and substantive due process claim (347 F.3d 370) are also dismissed.

In conclusion, the Court grants Defendants' motions to dismiss, and Plaintiffs' claims are dismissed with prejudice.
