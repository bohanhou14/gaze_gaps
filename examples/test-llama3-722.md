In light of the provided reference cases, I will analyze the legal issues at hand. The first case, 895 F.2d 533, discusses the concept of "official detention" under section 3585(b) of the United States Code. The court holds that a defendant is entitled to credit for time served in official detention prior to the commencement of his sentence, provided that the detention was a result of the offense for which the sentence was imposed.

In the present case, the defendant is seeking credit for the 126 days he spent in Community Treatment Centers (CTCs) while on supervised release. The CTCs were treating the defendant for drug addiction, and the conditions and restrictions at the centers were similar to those found in a prison. Therefore, I conclude that the CTCs were "official detention" for the purposes of section 3585(b).

The second case, 967 F.2d 1397, discusses the issue of whether a defendant is entitled to credit for time served in a treatment center while on supervised release. The court holds that a defendant is entitled to credit for such time, provided that the credit has not been credited against another sentence.

Applying these principles to the present case, I conclude that the defendant is entitled to credit for the 126 days he spent in the CTCs. The credit should be applied against his revocation sentence, which was imposed for violating the conditions of his supervised release.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of the reference cases, I find that the defendant is entitled to credit for the 126 days he spent in the CTCs while on supervised release. The credit should be applied against his revocation sentence. <answer>
