The principal contention in the defendant’s motion revolves around the definition and scope of the term "representative" under § 302(b) of the Labor Management Relations Act. The case law underscores that the term “representative” is to be understood in its statutory context rather than its commonplace meaning. A leading judicial interpretation by Justice Clark in the Supreme Court case of United States v. Ryan, 350 U.S. 299, clarified that the “president and principal negotiator of a labor union” falls within the definition of a "representative" under § 302(b).

Furthermore, as delineated in the case referenced as 225 F.2d 417, the interpretation of “representative” aligns with the primary purpose of Congress in enacting § 302: to prevent corruption and ensure the impartiality of union representatives. This interpretation was further upheld in the case at bar, where defendant Ryan, acting as the Business Representative of the International Union of Operating Engineers, is considered a representative within the meaning of the statute.

Therefore, the defendant’s argument that the indictment is vague fails in light of these precedents, as the statute and case law provide a clear framework for who constitutes a “representative” and what actions are prohibited under § 302(b). The prior rulings emphasize that receipt of any form of payment from an employer, except as expressly permitted, constitutes a violation. Citing United States v. Ryan, 350 U.S. at page 305, and United States v. Brennan, 134 F.Supp. 42, this court finds the indictment sufficiently detailed to inform the defendant of the charges and enable adequate preparation for defense.

The motion to dismiss and for a bill of particulars is accordingly denied, consistent with the established case law.
