The appellants were charged with violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952, which prohibits the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on of an unlawful activity. The appellants argued that the admission of evidence of the crime of abortion was error because it was not within the purview of the statute. However, the court held that the evidence of abortion was material to the issues being tried and was admissible.

Dillon argued that his statement was inadmissible because he was not taken before a commissioner without unnecessary delay. However, the court held that the delay was not unnecessary because the government had met the burden of proving that they diligently sought a commissioner and as soon as one was available, they took the accused before him for arraignment.

Duggar argued that his constitutional rights were violated because the Wichita Police denied him requests to make phone calls and to contact an attorney, vigorously interrogated him, and denied him food and rest. However, the court held that the evidence of the alleged misconduct was not credible and that the statements made by Duggar to the F.B.I. agent were admissible.

In the reference case 348 U.S. 84, the court held that a joint trial of codefendants does not necessarily result in prejudice to the defendant, and that the trial judge's discretion in determining whether to allow a joint trial should not be disturbed. Similarly, in the reference case 352 U.S. 232, the court held that a joint trial of codefendants does not necessarily result in prejudice to the defendant, and that the trial judge's discretion in determining whether to allow a joint trial should not be disturbed.

It is clear that the court's decision in this case is consistent with the principles established in the reference cases. The appellants' arguments that the admission of evidence of the crime of abortion and the admission of Duggar's statement were error are without merit. The court's decision to allow the joint trial of the appellants was also proper, and the appellants' arguments that prejudice resulted from the joint trial are without merit.

In conclusion, the appellants' claims of error are without merit, and the court's decision in this case is consistent with the principles established in the reference cases. The evidence of the crime of abortion was admissible, Duggar's statement was admissible, and the joint trial of the appellants was proper.

gold_text: It is interesting to note that each judge except two in this circuit has written on the rule announced in Opper v. United States, 348 U.S. 84, 95, 75 S.Ct. 158, 99 L.Ed. 101 (1954). Each case holds that the trial court’s discretion is broad and its action will be upheld in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion. We find no clear abuse of discretion here. The cautionary instruction cured what might otherwise have been resulting prejudice. “We may * * * fairly proceed on the basis that the jury followed these instructions.” Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 232, 241, 77 S.Ct. 294, 299, 1 L.Ed.2d 278 (1957).
