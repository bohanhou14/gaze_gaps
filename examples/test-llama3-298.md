The case involves a bank fraud scheme where the defendants, Shively and Pardee, were convicted of bank fraud and conspiracy. Shively, the president of the First National Bank of Marshall, made a loan to Pardee, a partner in a firm called Design Plus, with the intention of using the loan proceeds for his own personal gain. Pardee signed a promissory note stating that the loan was for "business expense and marketing operation." However, the government failed to prove that the bank was insured at the time of the offense, which is an essential element of a section 1014 offense.

The court held that the government failed to prove the insured status of the bank and acquitted Pardee of the charge of violating section 1014. However, the court found that Shively was guilty of violating section 656, which prohibits willful misapplication of bank funds. The court also found that both Shively and Pardee conspired to violate sections 656 and 1014.

The court discussed the issue of severance and held that the trial court's decision to allow the joint trial was within its discretion. The court also discussed the issue of conspiracy and held that the government can use the general federal conspiracy statute to punish conspiracies to defraud banks, even if the bank is not insured.

In conclusion, the case highlights the importance of proving the insured status of a bank in a bank fraud scheme. The court's decision also underscores the importance of the government's burden of proof in criminal cases. Reference cases cited include 581 F.2d 489, 690 F.2d 1289.

gold_text: But Shively also casts his argument for severance in a more conventional form by appealing to a line of cases which hold that if codefendants have inconsistent defenses severance must be granted if — but only if — the defenses “conflict to the point of being irreconcilable and mutually exclusive.” United States v. Crawford, 581 F.2d 489, 491 (5th Cir.1978). See, e.g., United States v. Kopituk, 690 F.2d 1289, 1316 (11th Cir.1982). The danger is that in a case of irreconcilable and mutually exclusive defenses the jury is quite likely to convict at least one of the defendants without carefully weighing the evidence of his guilt. This is not such a case. The principal discrepancy between the two defendants’ stories was that Pardee testified that Shively had assured him that the loan was authorized even though the proceeds were intended for Pardee; this falls short of the type of conflict of which cases like Crawford and Kopituk speak. At all events, we do not think that Shively was made appreciably worse off by being tried with Pardee. Pardee made a rather appealing defendant since he had not profited personally from the various crimes that were charged and some of the jury’s expected sympathy for him might have lapped over to Shively. More important, Shively’s story which Pardee contradicted — that the loan was a bona fide loan for Pardee’s business needs, unrelated to Pardee’s personal loan to him — was incredible, and would not have been believed even if Pardee had not testified.
