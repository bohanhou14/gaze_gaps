**Generation:**

In the context of the Rehabilitation Act claim, Britting's challenge under 5 U.S.C. § 7703(b)(2) also lacks merit. The Merit Systems Protection Board's (MSPB) findings that upheld her suspension and termination were reviewed under the substantial evidence standard, as articulated in **305 U.S. 197** and reiterated in **900 F.2d 233**. Substantial evidence requires that such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept is adequate to support a conclusion (305 U.S. 197). The MSPB's determination that Britting failed to follow basic directives and that her transcription errors materially affected departmental productivity was based on substantial evidence.

Furthermore, the Board's decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The evaluation considered all relevant factors, including Britting's inability to adhere to supervisory reviews, thus adversely impacting workflow efficiency. The evidence presented by the VA sufficiently met the required burden, aligning with precedents that mandate more than mere suspicion to establish factual findings (900 F.2d 233).

Given that the MSPB provided detailed accounts of Britting's performance issues and the reasonable accommodations already made, the evidence supports the legality of her termination. Hence, the District Court's affirmation was correct under the applicable substantial evidence standard, and we find no basis for overturning this decision.

Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

Substantial evidence “ ‘means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.’” Bradley v. Veterans Admin., 900 F.2d 233, 234 (Fed.Cir.1990) (quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. Labor Bd., 305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). Our review of the record reveals that there is substantial evidence to support the VA’s actions.
