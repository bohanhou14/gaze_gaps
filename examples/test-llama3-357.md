The case before us involves a defendant who was convicted of illegal reentry into the United States following deportation. The defendant's prior state-court conviction for assault with the intent to inflict serious injury was used to enhance his sentence. The defendant argued that this conviction did not qualify as a "crime of violence" under the sentencing guidelines.

In reviewing this case, we must consider the definition of a "crime of violence" as stated in the commentary to the guidelines. This definition includes offenses that have an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, and includes murder, manslaughter, kidnaping, aggravated assault, and forcible sex offenses. United States v. Charles, 301 F.3d 309, 312-313 (5th Cir.2002).

The defendant argued that his state-court conviction for assault with the intent to inflict serious injury did not qualify as a "crime of violence" because it was not specifically listed under subsection (II) of the definition. However, the commentary to the guidelines states that an offense that has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another is a "crime of violence" regardless of whether it is listed specifically. United States v. Uribe-Garcia, 323 F.3d 317, 318 (5th Cir.2003).

Therefore, we hold that the defendant's prior state-court conviction for assault with the intent to inflict serious injury qualifies as a "crime of violence" and that the district court did not err in enhancing his sentence accordingly. United States v. Vargas-Duran, 319 F.3d 194, 196 (5th Cir.2003).

In conclusion, the defendant's prior state-court conviction for assault with the intent to inflict serious injury qualifies as a "crime of violence" under the sentencing guidelines, and the district court did not err in enhancing his sentence accordingly. The sentence is AFFIRMED.

gold_text: However, Uribe acknowledges that his state-court conviction was for an assault that constitutes an “aggravated felony” for the purposes of the sentencing guidelines because the term of incarceration was for more than one year. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43). In addition, the nature of Uribe’s state-court offense was an aggravated assault, which satisfies both subsections (I) and (II) of the guideline’s definition of a “crime of violence.” United States v. Vargas-Duran, 319 F.3d 194, 196 (5th Cir.2003); United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 323 F.3d 317, 318 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the district court was correct in applying a 16-level increase to Uribe’s base offense level.
