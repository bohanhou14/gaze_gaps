In this case, the plaintiff seeks to hold the Dallas Independent School District (DISD) and its principal liable for the death of Andrew Gaston, a 14-year-old student who was killed in a shooting at his school. The plaintiff argues that the school district had a constitutional duty to protect Andrew from harm and that its failure to do so was a violation of his due process rights.

The court rejects the plaintiff's argument, citing the Supreme Court's decision in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189 (1989). In DeShaney, the Court held that a state's failure to protect an individual from private violence does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause unless the state has taken the individual into its custody and holds them there against their will.

The court also notes that the plaintiff's claim does not fall within the "special relationship" exception to the DeShaney rule. In this exception, a state has a constitutional duty to protect an individual if it has taken them into its custody and holds them there against their will. However, the court finds that Andrew was not in the custody of the school district at the time of his death, and therefore, the district did not have a constitutional duty to protect him.

The court also rejects the plaintiff's argument that the school district had a constitutional duty to protect Andrew due to the school's "special relationship" with him as a student. The court notes that while the school district has a duty to provide a safe learning environment, this duty is not a constitutional duty.

Finally, the court rejects the plaintiff's claim that the school district was liable for Andrew's death under a theory of negligent supervision. The court finds that the school district did not have a duty to supervise Andrew's activities outside of school, and therefore, it was not liable for his death.

The court's decision is supported by reference cases such as 7 F.3d 729, 975 F.2d 727, and 909 F.2d 267, which all hold that a state's failure to protect an individual from private violence does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause unless the state has taken the individual into its custody and holds them there against their will.

gold_text: . It is Texas law that, with few exceptions, students are required to attend school until they reach the age of 17. See Tex.Educ.Code Ann. § 21.032 (Vemon 1987 & Supp.1993). See also Tex.Educ.Code Ann. § 21.033 (exemptions from compulsory attendance requirements). Further, Texas law requires students usually to attend the public school, often a neighborhood school, designated by the district. See Tex.Educ.Code Ann. § 21.032(a) (Vernon Supp.1993). State law places the school in loco parentis during ordinary school hours and during the conduct of certain school activities. See, e.g., Mercer v. State, 450 S.W.2d 715 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1970, error dism'd as moot). Notwithstanding similar laws in other states, four courts of appeals have held that a student is not "in custody” within DeSha-ney. These courts reason that custody in DeSha-ney meant such an involuntary, full-time physical restraint and superintendence as prevents a person from otherwise independently providing for his needs and safety. See Dorothy I. v. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 7 F.3d 729 (8th Cir.1993); Maldonado v. Josey, 975 F.2d 727, 731 (10th Cir.1992); D.R. v. Middle Bucks Area Vocational Technical Sch., 972 F.2d at 1370-72; J.O. v. Alton Community Unit Sch. Dist. 11, 909 F.2d 267, 272 (7th Cir.1990). Public school attendance is deemed “voluntary” because parents are permitted to withdraw their students from the public schools. Further, parents remain the principal caretakers of their children even though they are housed at school for at least six to eight hours daily.
