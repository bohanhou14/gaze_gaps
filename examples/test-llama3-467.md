In this case, we consider whether the district court erred in concluding that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that to establish reliance in a securities fraud case based on fraud-on-the-market, plaintiffs must show that the defendant made public material misrepresentations, the defendant's shares were traded in an efficient market, and the plaintiffs traded shares between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed. Nathenson v. Zonagen, Inc., 267 F.3d 400, 406-07 (5th Cir.2001).

The district court found that the price of Crossroads stock did not significantly decline following the release of the allegedly false statements, and therefore, the plaintiffs were not entitled to the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that a plaintiff cannot rely on "special circumstances" to establish reliance, and that a causal relationship between the statement and actual movement of the stock price is still required. Nathenson, 267 F.3d at 418-419.

In this case, the allegedly false statements made by Crossroads regarding the features of its products and financial statements did not cause a statistically significant decline in stock price. Therefore, the district court did not err in concluding that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance. This decision is consistent with the holding in Nathenson that a plaintiff must show that the stock price was actually affected by the allegedly false statement. Nathenson, 267 F.3

gold_text: A statement of belief is only open to objection where the evidence shows that the speaker did not in fact hold that belief and the statement made asserted something false or misleading about the subject matter. Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. 1083,1095-1096, 111 S.Ct. 2749, 115 L.Ed.2d 929 (1991). Assuming, without deciding, the plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that Smith did not actually believe his statement, the plaintiffs still cannot survive summary judgment on this claim because the plaintiffs have not shown the statement was false. In order for the plaintiffs allegation to be true (and for Smith’s statement to be false) it is necessary that the decline in stock price prior to Smith’s 13 July 2000 statement have actually been caused by the negative interoperability and inventory information. The plaintiffs, however, have offered no evidence that the market learned of this information at any time prior to its release on 27 July 2000, two weeks after Smith’s statement. The plaintiffs claim is supported by nothing more than an unsubstantiated conclusory statement. Such statements are not competent summary judgment evidence. Abbott v. Equity Group, Inc., 2 F.3d 613, 619 (5th Cir.1993) (“Unsubstantiated assertions are not competent summary judgment evidence”); Hugh Symons Group, plc v. Motorola, Inc., 292 F.3d 466, 470 (5th Cir.2002) (conclusory statements are not sufficient to successfully oppose a motion for summary judgment). For these reasons, the district court correctly granted summary judgment as to the statement made on 13 July 2000.
