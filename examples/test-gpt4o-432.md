IV. DISCUSSION (continued)
A. Qualified Immunity
As established in the context of qualified immunity, the court must determine whether an officer's actions violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights (505 F.3d 161). Similarly, while evaluating whether plaintiffs own a valid copyright in the Design, the Court must consider if there was any legitimate basis for denying the existence of such rights.

B. Material Facts and Genuine Disputes
In deciding motions for summary judgment, the court must assess whether there is a genuine issue of material fact that necessitates a trial (477 U.S. 242). Here, defendants have failed to demonstrate any material factual disputes that would prevent summary judgment. They primarily base their arguments on speculative assertions rather than substantive evidence.

Given that there is no genuine dispute of material facts, summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the issue of copyright ownership is appropriate. Plaintiffs have provided credible testimony and substantial evidence, rebutting defendants' assertion that the Design is unoriginal or copied from the public domain. 

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons outlined, plaintiffs own a valid copyright in their Design. The Clerk of the Court is directed to close the motions [Document Nos. 18, 28, 43] and amend the caption accordingly. Plaintiffs are also granted leave to refile their motion concerning their Lanham Act trade dress claim.

SO ORDERED.
