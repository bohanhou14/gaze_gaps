The case at hand involves a dispute between ITT Electro-Optical Products Division and Electronic Technology Corporation (ETC) regarding the alleged misappropriation of ETC's confidential information. The court is tasked with determining whether the information sought by ETC from K & M Electronics Inc. (K & M) is relevant and necessary to the action.

In United States v. Arthur Young & Co., 465 U.S. 805, 104 S.Ct. 1495 (1984), it was held that accountants' ethics should not be enforced by excluding evidence or curtailing discovery. Similarly, in V. D. Anderson Co. v. Helena Cotton Oil Co., 117 F.Supp. 932, 941 (E.D.Ark. 1953), it was noted that where information sought is relevant and necessary to the presentation of the case, the fact that such information constitutes a trade secret need not bar discovery.

The court finds that the information sought by ETC from K & M represents trade secrets and that its disclosure could be harmful to K & M. However, ETC has established that the disclosure of trade secrets is relevant and necessary to the action. The court must balance the need for trade secrets against the claim of injury resulting from disclosure.

In Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962), it was held that a party may not be compelled to produce confidential information that is not relevant to the action. However, in this case, the information sought by ETC appears to be relevant to the alleged misappropriation of ETC's confidential information.

In conclusion, the court denies K & M's Motion to Quash and grants ITT's Motion to Compel in part. The court orders that K & M produce the information sought by ETC, subject to a protective order limiting disclosure of confidential information to counsel for the parties. The parties shall proceed with discovery, subject to the protective order.

In the instant case, the court believes that the enforcement of much of the subpoena is reasonable: the need for the information by ETC outweighs the possible injury to K & M, and the court has issued a carefully-fashioned protective order to guard against improper disclosure of any trade secrets. The court uses a number of protective procedures. See Davidson Pipe Co. v. Laventhol and Horwath, 120 F.R.D. 455 (S.D.N.Y.1988); GTE Products Corp. v. Gee, 112 F.R.D 169 (D.Mass.1986) (disclosure limited to counsel); Alloy Cast Steel Co. v. United Steel Workers of America, 70 F.R.D. 687 (D.C.Ohio 1976), opinion incorporated, 429 F.Supp. 445 (N.D.Ohio 1977) (answers to interrogatories limited to defendant and counsel); and Spartanics, Ltd. v.
