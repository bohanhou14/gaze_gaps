**Generation:**

Applying the principles derived from the reference cases, we find no jurisdiction under either 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) or 28 U.S.C. § 158(d). As articulated in 661 F.2d 279, an interlocutory order is not final if denying review will not cause irreparable harm and the order will be preserved for future review. Here, denying immediate review of the district court’s stay order does not result in irreparable harm to TWA because the funds' disbursement can be addressed after the district court’s final decision on the setoff issue.

Additionally, 450 U.S. 79 emphasizes that for an interlocutory order to be immediately appealable under § 1292(a)(1), the appellant must show that denying immediate appeal will have a "serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence." Given that TWA can pursue its claims after the final judgment on the setoff, the appeal does not meet this threshold. 

Thus, in line with precedent, we dismiss TWA’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

gold_text: We, therefore, hold that we lack appellate jurisdiction under either § 1292(a)(1) or § 158(d) to consider TWA’s appeal of the October 19, 1993 order of the district court granting the Government a stay pending appeal of the bankruptcy court’s September 30, 1993 order. Here, “‘the general congressional policy against piecemeal review pre-elude[s] interlocutory appeal.’” See United States v. RMI Co., 661 F.2d 279, 281 (3d Cir.1981) (quoting Carson v.
