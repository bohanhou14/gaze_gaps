In considering the new value exception to the absolute priority rule, it is essential to examine the circumstances under which a debtor's equity holders may participate in a reorganization plan. As Justice Douglas noted in Kansas City Terminal Ry. v. Central Union Trust Co., 271 U.S. 445, 46 S.Ct. 549, 70 L.Ed. 1028 (1926), additional funds may be necessary to the success of the undertaking, and it may be impossible to obtain them unless stockholders are permitted to contribute and retain an interest sufficiently valuable to move them.

In Los Angeles Lumber Prods. Co. v. Case, 308 U.S. 106, 121, 60 S.Ct. 1, 10, 84 L.Ed. 110 (1939), the Supreme Court emphasized that a qualifying new value contribution must be (1) necessary to the reorganization; (2) in the form of money or money's worth; and (3) reasonably equivalent to the interest retained. Furthermore, the Court declared that a contribution must be substantial and "up front," as seen in In re Potter Material Serv., Inc., 781 F.2d 99, 101 (7th Cir.1986), and In re Stegall, 85 B.R. 510, 514 (C.D.Ill.1987), aff'd, 865 F.2d 140 (7th Cir.1989).

In the present case, the Debtors propose to obtain a release of their father's lien on their farm machinery and to pay the creditors the value of the machinery ($20,000) over five years. However, this contribution does not meet the requirements of the new value exception. The release of the lien is not an up-front infusion of money or money's worth, and the future payments from the farm's operation are not "up front" and do not constitute the sort of infusion of new funds "essential to the success of the undertaking" contemplated by the new value exception. Therefore, the Debtors' proposed contribution fails to meet the requirements of the new value exception.

In conclusion, the new value exception remains viable under the 1978 Code, and the Debtors' proposed contribution fails to meet its requirements. The Court should not allow the capital infusion and concomitant equity participation without the consent of the senior interests, as stated in 102 B.R. 560. The

gold_text: The other component of the Debtors' proposed contribution is a $30,000 cash payment. The bankruptcy court and the district court held that the proposed payment was not substantial and therefore insufficient to qualify for the new value exception. In particular, the courts observed that the $30,000 contribution amounted to only 2.7 percent of the $1,100,-000 due unsecured creditors, and 3.3 percent of the unsecured debt owed to Farm Credit. The Debtors argue that the lower courts should not have compared the amount of the proposed contribution to the amount of unsecured debt in determining whether the contribution is substantial. Instead, they argue, to be substantial the amount contributed must be equal only to the value of the interest retained under the plan. This Court, however, has previously rejected such an interpretation of the "substantial" requirement. Stegal4 865 F.2d at 144. The requirement that a contribution be substantial is independent of the rule that a contribution must be at least equal to the value of the interest retained. See Potter Material Serv., Inc., 781 F.2d at 101. The substantiality requirement is derived not from Los Angeles Lumber `s third criterion, but from its first-that an infusion of new capital must be necessary to the success of the undertaking. Contributions that are merely nominal, or "gratuitous, token cash infusions proposed primarily to `buy' cheap financing," will not suffice.
