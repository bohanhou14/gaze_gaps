We now turn to the issue of probable cause, particularly whether evidence obtained after the seizure can be used to support the forfeiture. This court has previously aligned with the approach that allows for the consideration of such evidence. In United States v. 4492 S. Livonia Rd., the Second Circuit held that a district court must assess probable cause at the time of the forfeiture hearing, including any legally obtained evidence developed thereafter (889 F.2d 1258, 1268). Additionally, the government's reliance on evidence obtained post-seizure has been affirmed in cases like United States v. $67,220.00, where it was deemed permissible to incorporate facts learned after the initial taking to justify forfeiture (957 F.2d 280). Thus, we conclude that the district court correctly allowed the use of proffer statements obtained after the initial seizure in establishing probable cause for forfeiture.

The district court further noted that hearsay evidence traditionally establishes probable cause in both criminal and civil contexts. As highlighted in Tahuna, probable cause can be based on hearsay even when real property is involved (889 F.2d 1258). This principle underscores the sufficiency of the government's evidence, including Mr. Oloko's proffer statements, to meet the probable cause standard.

Therefore, drawing from these precedents, we affirm the district court's rulings on both the utilization of post-seizure evidence and hearsay in supporting probable cause for forfeiture.

[o]nce a forfeiture proceeding is brought, if further evidence is legally obtained to justify the government’s belief, there is no persuasive reason to bar its use”); see also United States v. Daccarett, 6 F.3d 37, 56 (2d Cir.1993) (noting that "[t]he machinery of our civil forfeiture laws permits the government to seize property without probable cause, institute a civil forfeiture proceeding, and then use civil discovery as a means of accessing information necessary to effect a forfeiture”), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1191, 114 S.Ct. 1294, 127 L.Ed.2d 648 (1994). We note that, in $191,910.00 in U.S. Currency, the Ninth Circuit has suggested that there is some ambiguity in the Eleventh Circuit's position. See 16 F.3d at 1070 n. 38 (citing United States v. Four Parcels of Real Property, 941 F.2d 1428, 1439 & n. 24 (11th Cir.1991) (en banc)).
