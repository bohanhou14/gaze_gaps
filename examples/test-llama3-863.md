The question raised in this case is whether the consignor is liable for freight charges when the carrier delivers the shipment to the consignee without collecting the charges. The parties entered into a Bill of Lading contract that provided for a non-recourse agreement, where the consignor agreed not to make delivery of the shipment without payment of freight and all other charges. However, the carrier failed to enforce the non-recourse agreement and delivered the shipment to the consignee without collecting the charges.

In Illinois Steel Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 320 U.S. 508, the court held that the consignor is not responsible for freight charges that it has not prepaid. Similarly, in Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Central Iron Co., 265 U.S. 59, the court stated that the shipper is not bound by the terms of the Bill of Lading if the carrier does not enforce the non-recourse agreement.

In this case, the carrier failed to advise the consignor of the List, which designated West Frankfort, Illinois as a prepay station. The carrier also failed to enforce the non-recourse agreement and delivered the shipment to the consignee without collecting the charges. Therefore, the consignor is not liable for the freight charges.

The court concludes that the Bill of Lading contracts between the parties should prevail over the List, as the carrier failed to advise the consignor of the List and did not enforce the non-recourse agreement. The Congressional intent behind the tariff laws is to prevent rebates and to require all shipments to be made at the same rate. In this case, the parties are free to stipulate who shall pay the rate. As stated in Am.Jur.2d, "The only liability for freight charges incurred by the consignor after he signs such a non-recourse statement is in the event that the goods are not accepted by the consignee upon delivery." 13 Am. Jur.2d ยง 477 at p. 947.

Therefore, the consignor is not liable for the freight charges in this case, and the carrier must bear the liability for delivering the shipment to the consignee without collecting the charges. <answer>
