A preliminary injunction, as consistently underscored in legal precedents, aims to preserve the status quo ante litem, not to adjudicate the full merits of the case prematurely. In Tanner Motor Livery, Ltd. v. Avis, Inc., 316 F.2d 804, it was explicitly stated that the proper function of a preliminary injunction is to maintain the last uncontested status which preceded the controversy and should not transform the hearing into a trial on the merits. The status quo, in essence, is aimed to ensure that neither party gains an unfair advantage before the actual trial.

In the present case, the ABC-CFA contract's exclusivity provisions, as referenced in 747 F.2d 511, disrupted an existing broadcasting agreement the plaintiffs had with CBS, thereby altering the broadcast competition landscape. Preserving the status quo means maintaining the broadcasting dynamics as they were before the contested ABC-CFA contract took effect.

The defendant SFIâ€™s issuance of poison pill warrants similarly disrupts the existing shareholder structure and potentially thwarts legitimate tender offers. Therefore, to preserve the shareholders' existing rights and the corporate structure as it stood prior to the issuance of these warrants, a preliminary injunction is warranted. Such an injunction would align with the principle set forth in 316 F.2d 804 by preventing changes that preempt a fair trial on the merits.

In the instant case, the status quo would be the situation before the adoption of the rights plan and the issuance of the warrants.
