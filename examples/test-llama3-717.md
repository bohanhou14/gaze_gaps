In the context of legal cases, the issue of applicable law is crucial in determining the outcome of a dispute. In the cases mentioned, the courts have emphasized the importance of ascertaining the applicable law, whether it be federal or state law.

In Reference case 313 U.S. 487, the court held that Delaware is free to determine whether a given matter is to be governed by the law of the forum or some other law, subject only to review by the Supreme Court on any federal question that may arise. This decision highlights the importance of state law in resolving conflicts.

In Reference case 304 U.S. 64, the court noted that the rights of the parties were governed by state law, and that the federal court should ascertain what the state law is, rather than what it ought to be. This decision emphasizes the importance of understanding the applicable state law in resolving conflicts.

In Reference case 376 U.S. 612, the court held that the applicable state law should be determined by the conflict of laws rules of the transferee state, even if the laws of the transferor state would be different. This decision highlights the importance of considering the conflict of laws rules in determining the applicable law.

In the present case, it is clear that the applicable law is Tennessee law. The plaintiffs concede that the one-year statute of limitations is applicable whether by virtue of Wisconsin law or Illinois law. The court finds that the requirements of Rule 15(c) have been satisfied, and that the statute of limitations issue can be resolved before trial. The court also finds that the defense of contributory negligence is insufficient, as the laws of Tennessee do not apply.

In conclusion, the applicable law in this case is Tennessee law, and the court finds that the statute of limitations issue can be resolved before trial. The defense of contributory negligence is insufficient, and the case should proceed accordingly.
