In the context of the legal cases provided, the question of whether a non-signatory to a collective bargaining agreement is a proper party to a suit brought under § 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA) is crucial. In the case of Choy v. Joint Committee, supra, the court held that a non-signatory to a collective bargaining agreement can be a proper party to a suit brought under § 301(a) if the suit is based on an alleged breach of contract between an employer and a labor organization and the resolution of the lawsuit is focused upon and governed by the terms of the contract.

As stated in the reference case 371 U.S. 195, the policy underlying § 301 is to promote industrial peace by permitting agreements between labor organizations and employers to be enforced in federal court. Collective bargaining agreements must be interpreted and enforced in a uniform manner to accomplish such a policy. In the same vein, the reference case 587 F.2d 1379 supports the notion that a non-signatory to a collective bargaining agreement can be a proper party to a suit brought under § 301(a) if the suit is based on an alleged breach of contract between an employer and a labor organization and the resolution of the lawsuit is focused upon and governed by the terms of the contract.

In the context of the Choy case, the Joint Committee is not a signatory to the Agreement but is still a proper party to the suit brought under § 301(a). The court's decision is based on the fact that the suit is based on an alleged breach of contract between an employer and a labor organization and the resolution of the lawsuit is focused upon and governed by the terms of the contract. The court's decision is in line with the policy underlying § 301 and the notion that collective bargaining agreements must be interpreted and enforced in a uniform manner.

In conclusion, a non-signatory to a collective bargaining agreement can be a proper party to a suit brought under § 301(a) if the suit is based on an alleged breach of contract between an employer and a labor organization and the resolution of the lawsuit is focused upon and governed by the terms of the contract. This is supported by the reference cases 371 U.S. 195 and 587 F.2d 1379. The court's decision in the Choy case is in line with the policy underlying § 301 and the notion that collective bargaining agreements must be interpreted and enforced

gold_text: . The Joint Committee probably is not an employer or a labor organization under the Labor Management Relations Act either. We need not rule on that point, however, because it is well settled that parties in a § 301 action do not necessarily have to be employers or labor organizations. The word “between” in § 301(a) refers to “contracts” between an employer and a labor organization, not to “suits” between them. Smith v.
