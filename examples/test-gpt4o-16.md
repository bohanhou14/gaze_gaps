The question of whether Miles's testimony against Bledsoe was protected under the First Amendment aligns with established case law. In reference case 869 F.2d 1565, the court affirmed that testimony given in an official procedural context is deemed protected speech. Similarly, the court in 828 F.2d 1096 underscored that a government employer cannot retaliate against an employee for their exercise of First Amendment rights, particularly when such testimony concerns matters of public interest.

Furthermore, in brushing against retaliatory actions, we see reflection in case 693 F.2d 359, where procedural integrity is paramount, and the protective testament of constitutional rights retains its significance even in the face of institutional reviews. Given these precedents, Miles's testimony at Bledsoe’s criminal trial was indeed a form of protected speech.

Conclusively, Beckworth's actions, motivated by retaliatory intent against such protected speech, fall within the ambit of unconstitutional conduct under § 1983, thus disallowing the shield of qualified immunity. Such a determination aligns with the interpretation of existing precedent which firmly places retaliation against First Amendment-protected speech beyond legal tolerance.

We AFFIRM the district court’s denial of qualified immunity on grounds consistent with established jurisprudence.

gold_text: Beckworth contends that Miles’s First Amendment retaliation claim is not based on clearly established federal law. Prior cases, however, have established that testimony in judicial proceedings are inherently of public concern for First Amendment purposes. Johnston v. Harris Cnty. Flood Control Dist., 869 F.2d 1565, 1578 (5th Cir.1989) (“When an employee testifies before an official government adjudicatory or fact-finding body, he speaks in a context that is inherently of public concern”); Smith v. Hightower, 693 F.2d 359, 368 (5th Cir.1982) (holding that testimony in criminal proceedings is protected speech); Reeves v. Claiborne Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 828 F.2d 1096, 1100 (5th Cir.1987) (holding that testimony in civil proceedings is protected speech). First Amendment protection for Miles’s speech is clearly established.
