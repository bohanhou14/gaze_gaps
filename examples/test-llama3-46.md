In the case of Ferguson v. United States, the court held that the stop and arrest of the defendant were unconstitutional because the police officers lacked reasonable suspicion and probable cause for the stop and arrest. The court found that the officers' testimony was riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions, including the fact that Glemaud testified that he saw a metal stem in the middle console, while Anderson testified that he did not see such a stem.

In Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), the Supreme Court held that an officer may stop and frisk a person if he has a reasonable suspicion that the person is engaged in criminal activity. However, in this case, the court found that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion or probable cause to stop the defendant's vehicle.

In United States v. Sanchez, 638 F.2d 507 (1981), the court held that an officer may make an investigatory stop if he has a reasonable suspicion that the person is engaged in criminal activity. However, in this case, the court found that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion or probable cause to stop the defendant's vehicle.

The court also found that the officers' mistakes and inconsistencies were not minor ones, but rather significant ones that affected important facts, such as how many individuals were in the vehicle, whether a metal stem or a glass pipe or any contraband was seen in the center console, and whether and when the officers made a radio transmission or computer search.

Therefore, based on the evidence presented, the court finds that the stop and arrest of the defendant were unconstitutional because the police officers lacked reasonable suspicion and probable cause for the stop and arrest. The court grants the motion to suppress the evidence recovered during the stop and arrest.

gold_text: In the end, the police officers’ instincts were correct, as Ferguson, a convicted felon, was indeed in possession of an illegal weapon. But those instincts were based not on any articulable, objective facts suggestive of unlawful conduct, but on, at best, an “inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or ‘hunch’ ” of criminal activity. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). In view of the errors and inconsistencies in the record, I am not persuaded that the officers stopped Ferguson because of excessively tinted windows, I am not persuaded that the windows were illegally tinted (or that they even seemed to be so), and I am not persuaded that the officers saw a metal crack stem in plain view in the center console of the car. Rather, I believe this was nothing other than a random stop. Accordingly, the gun and other physical evidence will be suppressed. See United States v. Vasquez, 638 F.2d 507, 520 (2d Cir.1980) (“[I]nvestigatory stops cannot be made completely at random ... or at the ‘unfettered discretion of officers in the field.’ ”) (citations omitted).
