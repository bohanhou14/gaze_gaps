**Generation:**

We find ample precedent in the federal cases that touch upon the enforceability of claims and obligations involving land and property where jurisdictional challenges are raised. In support of our position, several cases compel us to recognize the federal court's jurisdiction.

Firstly, referring to 28 L. Ed. 101, which underscored that for a decree merely in personam to be enforceable, actual service within the jurisdiction is paramount. Here, the respondent was served properly, aligning with the premise that such service beyond publication is necessary against a non-resident defendant.

Also, in harmony with 33 L. Ed. 447, it was established that the substantive question didn’t appear to have been raised in state courts initially, noting the necessity of these questions to be addressed at federal levels if they involve due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. In our case, the jurisdictional challenge must address and potentially reinterpret the obligation's enforceability through a federal lens.

Further, as demonstrated in 33 L. Ed. 918, a state has jurisdiction over titles to real estate within its borders and can validly determine these matters through statutes. Maine’s statutes allow for the appraisal procedure invoked here, reinforcing our court's jurisdiction despite challenges based on the supposed non-binding nature of the election process invoked by the complainant.

Referencing Hart v. Sansom (35 L. Ed. 640), it elucidates that a decree cannot annul a deed or establish a title intrinsically but can enforce obligations that respondents like Mrs. Abbot must adhere to, especially when contractual ties to the property are evident.

Lastly, in 40 L. Ed. 688, it reflects the understanding that constructive service and jurisdiction over non-residents can be fundamentally upheld under specific statutes, aligning with our statutory interpretations.

In conclusion, examining the statutory framework and jurisprudence, this court has jurisdiction, and the motion to dismiss lacks substantial grounds. The issues raised are more appropriately resolved under formal proceedings addressing the merits.

gold_text: This leaves only one proposition which can be claimed to be strictly one of jurisdiction, and which, therefore, ought to be considered by us; that in the absence of any special statutory provision as to the form of relief in case the complainant is entitled to any, a Circuit Court of the United States sitting in equity is powerless to shape it. Of course, if we are powerless to give relief in case we find the merits are with the complainant, it would be fruitless for us to proceed further and the bill should be dismissed; but if the complainant has any right we are confident that some form of relief will be found, although it would not at present be prudent to assume to forecast its particular character, nor would we be able to do so with certainty. What it would be will, of course, depend on the particular result on the merits. In this respect the respondent shares the impression which has gone abroad from the decision of the Supreme Court in Hart v. Sansom, 110 U. S. 151, 3 Sup. Ct. 586, 28 L. Ed. 101. Taken broadly, and in some aspects in which it might be taken, the result of that case would be astonishing, and might afford serious difficulties in the way of the present complainant; but Hart v. Sansom has never been taken seriously since it was announced. Indeed, subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court have so cut it down that it must be held to have decided only as to the particular form of procedure marked out by the judgment which it reviewed. Sugg v. Thornton, 132 U. S. 524, 10 Sup. Ct. 163, 33 L. Ed. 447; Arndt v. Griggs, 134 U. S. 316, 10 Sup. Ct. 557, 33 L. Ed. 918; Carpenter v. Strange, 141 U. S. 87, 106, 11 Sup. Ct. 960, 35 L. Ed. 640; and other cases which might be cited. That it has no application to the federal courts proceeding upon broad principles of equity was formally decided in Lynch v. Murphy, 161 U. S. 247, 250, 251, 252, 16 Sup. Ct. 523, 40 L. Ed. 688, where exactly the relief prayed for by the complainant, in the way of appointing a trustee to make a conveyance of the title of an absent party by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, was sustained.
