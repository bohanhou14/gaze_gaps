Our conclusion aligns with the well-established principle that filing deadlines are claim-processing rules, not jurisdictional bars, as clarified in several Supreme Court decisions. For instance, in Kontrick v. Ryan, the Court emphasized that procedural rules for time limits do not define the jurisdictional boundaries of the bankruptcy courts (540 U.S. 443). This perspective aligns with other rulings such as Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, where the Court cautioned against using "jurisdictional" too broadly (523 U.S. 83, 90).

The Supreme Court has affirmed that non-jurisdictional time limits are "quintessential claim-processing rules" in cases like Henderson v. Shinseki (560 U.S. 631). Similarly, in United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, the Court reiterated that "Congress must do something special" to turn a statute of limitations into a jurisdictional bar (135 S.Ct. 1625, 1632).

Further, the Court's decision in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp. supports our view that statutory context plays a crucial role in determining a provision's jurisdictional nature, specifically when there's a structural separation between jurisdictional grants and time limits (546 U.S. 500, 515-516). This structural understanding is also reflected in Carlisle v. United States (517 U.S. 416, 419-433).

Finally, the non-jurisdictional nature of time limits in other statutes, such as the Medicare Act highlighted in Gonzalez (568 U.S. 145) and the Bankruptcy Code in Espinosa (559 U.S. 260), consistently supports our interpretation. Therefore, the time limit in § 727(e)(1) should be regarded as a non-jurisdictional claim-processing rule, making the BAP's ruling fundamentally flawed.

gold_text: The BAP concluded that § 727(e)(l)’s time limit must be regarded as jurisdictional because it is contained in a statute, rather than a court rule. 529 B.R. at 752-53. The BAP based that conclusion on its reading of Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004), which held that the time limit specified in Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4004 is non-jurisdictional. Id. at 447, 124 S.Ct. 906. But nothing in Kontrick says that if a time limit is set by statute it must be regarded as jurisdictional. If there were any doubt on that score, it has been erased by a series of subsequent decisions holding that a variety of statutory filing deadlines are non-jurisdictional. See, e.g., Kwai Fun Wong, 135 S.Ct. at 1632-33; Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U.S. 145, 133 S.Ct. 817, 821, 184 L.Ed.2d 627 (2013); Henderson, 562 U.S. at 441, 131 S.Ct. 1197; Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 645, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010). Indeed, post-Kontrick, even statutory filing deadlines found in the Bankruptcy Code itself, like § 727(e)(1), have been held to be non-jurisdictional. See, e.g., United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 559 U.S. 260, 270 n.9, 130 S.Ct. 1367, 176 L.Ed.2d 158 (2010); In re Raynor, 617 F.3d 1065, 1070 (8th Cir. 2010).
