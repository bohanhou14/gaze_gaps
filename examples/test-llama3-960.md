gold_text: The second remaining issue is a request by the Secretary for a prospective injunction restraining Defendants from future violations of the FLSA. The FLSA allows a court, in its discretion, to issue such injunctions. 29 U.S.C.A. § 217; Hector I.Nieves, 91 F.Supp.2d at 449. A court determining whether to issue an injunction should consider (1) the employer’s prior and present conduct; (2) any pattern of repetitive violations; (3) an employer’s intent to violate the FLSA; (4) the employer’s good faith attempt to comply with the FLSA; (5) whether the employer complied once it became aware of the FLSA’s requirements; (6) efforts to prevent recurrence; (7) the threat of violations in the future; and (8) absence of bad faith. See Reich v. Petroleum Sales, Inc., 30 F.3d 654, 657 (6th Cir.1994); Martin v. Coventry Fire Dist., 981 F.2d 1358, 1362 (1st Cir. 1992); Martin v.
