In analyzing the case of Zmuda v. United States, 423 F.2d 757, we can see that the court held that a registrant's failure to appeal his classification and failure to report for a pre-induction physical examination did not bar a challenge to the validity of his classification as a defense to a criminal prosecution for refusal to submit to induction. This ruling is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Falbo v. United States, 395 U.S. 185, which held that a registrant was entitled to exemption from military service as a sole surviving son.

In the case at hand, the court found that the defendant's conduct was sufficiently unambiguous to support a jury finding of a clear refusal to submit to a physical examination. The court relied on the principle that a registrant's intent can be inferred from his outward manifestations, and that a jury determination of clear refusal is simultaneously a determination of the clarity of his culpable intent.

Furthermore, the court held that the failure to follow the procedure in Army Regulation 601-270 is excused whenever the registrant's conduct is sufficiently unambiguous to render those clarifying actions unnecessary or creates a situation which renders it impractical, if not impossible, for the examining authorities to comply with the regulation.

In conclusion, the court's ruling in this case is consistent with the principles established in Zmuda and Falbo, and recognizes that a registrant's intent can be inferred from his outward manifestations. The court's decision also acknowledges that a registrant's failure to follow the procedure in Army Regulation 601-270 is excused in situations where the registrant's conduct is sufficiently unambiguous to render those clarifying actions unnecessary or creates a situation which renders it impractical, if not impossible, for the examining authorities to comply with the regulation. <answer>

gold_text: An equally cogent reason for rejection of appellant’s thesis flows from the rule that an improper classification is no defense to a prosecution for refusing to submit to the pre-induction physical examination. Appellant relies upon 32 CFR § 1660.20 which provides in effect that persons classified 1-0 who refuse to submit to the physical are to be expeditiously ordered to alternative service rather than being prosecuted. Here, however, appellant had not been classified 1-0 but occupied a I-A classification at the time he was ordered to report for the physical. Appellant’s reliance upon 32 CFR § 1660.20 must therefore rest upon the premise that registrants erroneously classified by the Selective Service System need not obey interim orders to which they could not be subjected if they had been placed in a classification which exempted them from induction into service. Inasmuch as appellant was I-A, 32 CFR § 1628.10 is applicable. It provides that before a registrant can be ordered to report for induction, or ordered to perform civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety or interest, he must receive an Armed Forces physical examination. In a situation somewhat analogous to our case, the Supreme Court ruled that a registrant is under a duty to comply with the order to report for a physical examination, citing 32 CFR §§ 1628.10 and 1628.-11, and that he may be criminally prosecuted for failure to comply. And finally the court stated, “[a]n invalid classification, if allowed to be raised, would have been a complete defense to that prosecution (failing to report for induction) ; it would not be a defense today to a prosecution for failure to report for a pre-induction examination.” McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. 185, 203, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 1667, 23 L.Ed.2d 194 (1969). United States v. Zmuda, 423 F.2d 757 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied 398 U.S. 960, 90 S.Ct. 2176, 26 L.Ed.2d 545 (1970), stands squarely for the proposition that a registrant who claims he was improperly classified must nevertheless report for a physical examination and is subject to prosecution if he fails to do so. Thus, assuming arguendo, that appellant had been erroneously denied a 1-0 classification, he was nevertheless required to submit to the physical.
