I. Introduction

In this case, the movant is a federal inmate who has filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. The movant claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence during his sentencing hearing. The district court denied the movant's motion without holding an evidentiary hearing.

II. Analysis

The movant's claim is based on two grounds. First, he claims that his trial counsel failed to present evidence of his acceptance of responsibility, including a statement he made to the authorities in 2004 admitting his involvement in the crime. Second, he claims that his trial counsel failed to object to the court's failure to consider all of the § 3553(a) factors during his sentencing.

In Solis v. United States, 252 F.3d 289, 293 (3d Cir.2001), the court held that a district court's failure to grant an evidentiary hearing when the files and records of the case are inconclusive on the issue of whether the movant is entitled to relief constitutes an abuse of discretion. In this case, the movant has not demonstrated that his trial counsel's performance was deficient or that he was prejudiced by their performance. Therefore, the court will deny the movant's motion without holding an evidentiary hearing.

III. Conclusion

In conclusion, the movant's motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence will be denied without holding an evidentiary hearing. The movant has not demonstrated that his trial counsel's performance was deficient or that he was prejudiced by their performance. Therefore, the court finds that the movant is not entitled to relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.

gold_text: Section 2255 requires a district court to hold an evidentiary hearing on a § 2255 motion unless the “motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show” that the movant is not entitled to relief. 28 U.S.C. § 2255; see also United States v. Booth, 432 F.3d 542, 545-46 (3d Cir.2005); United States v. McCoy, 410 F.3d 124, 131 (3d Cir.2005); Rule 8(a), 28 U.S.C. foll. § 2255. As previously explained, the record conclusively demonstrates that movant is not entitled to relief because his arguments are without merit. Therefore, the court will deny movant’s § 2255 motion without an evidentiary hearing.
