The case at hand involves a dispute over whether independent contractors are protected by the First Amendment from retaliatory government action. The Tenth Circuit held that independent contractors are protected by the First Amendment, citing Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U.S. 563 (1968). In Pickering, the Supreme Court held that public employees have a First Amendment right to speak on matters of public concern, and that government employers must balance the employee's right to free speech with their own interests as employers.

In the case at hand, the plaintiff, James L. Bolden, alleges that the City of Topeka retaliated against him for speaking out on a matter of public concern. Bolden claims that he was terminated from his janitorial contract with the City after he spoke out against the City's decision to increase taxes. The City argues that Bolden was not a public employee and therefore was not protected by the First Amendment.

The Court agrees with the Tenth Circuit that independent contractors are protected by the First Amendment, citing Umbehr v. McClure, 840 F. Supp. 837 (Kan. 1993). However, the Court finds that the City did not violate Bolden's First Amendment rights by terminating his contract. The Court notes that the City's decision to terminate Bolden's contract was not based on his speech, but rather on the City's need to reduce its budget.

In conclusion, the Court finds that the City did not violate Bolden's First Amendment rights by terminating his contract. The Court grants the City's motion for summary judgment on Bolden's claim that the City retaliated against him for speaking out on a matter of public concern. The Court notes that the City's decision to terminate Bolden's contract was not based on his speech, but rather on the City's need to reduce its budget.

Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 673, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996). To determine the extent of protection, courts weigh the government’s interests as contractor, against the free speech interests at stake. Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 672,116 S.Ct. 2342 (citing Pickering v. Bd. of Edu. of Township High Sch., 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968)). To prevail on his First Amendment claim, plaintiff must show that the termination of his contract was motivated by his speech on a matter of public concern. Id. at 675, 116 S.Ct. 2342 (speech on private employment matters unprotected). If he can do so, the City will have a valid defense if it can show that it would have terminated his contract regardless of his speech or that its legitimate interests outweighed plaintiffs free speech interests. Id.
