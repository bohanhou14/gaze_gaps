The case of Joseph Beringer raises questions about the intentional misconduct of the prosecutor during the trial and whether it constitutes grounds for a writ of habeas corpus. The prosecution's cross-examination of Harvey Webb, the only eyewitness, was particularly damaging to the defense and was characterized by unfounded and inflammatory questions. The prosecution's intent to provoke a mistrial is a question of fact, and the court must determine whether the prosecution's actions were intentional and designed to cause a mistrial.

In Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982), the Supreme Court established that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial of a defendant where the prosecutor engages in misconduct during the defendant's trial with the intent to provoke a mistrial. The court must examine the record to determine whether the prosecution's misconduct was intentional and whether it was designed to cause a mistrial.

In this case, the prosecution's cross-examination of Harvey Webb was marked by repeated and unfounded attacks on Webb's credibility and integrity. The prosecution's questions were designed to imply that Webb was a liar and that his testimony was unreliable. This type of misconduct is similar to the type of misconduct found in United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 612, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 320 (1976), where the prosecution's cross-examination of a witness was found to be improper and designed to provoke a mistrial.

The court must also consider the fact that the prosecution's misconduct was not limited to the cross-examination of Harvey Webb. The prosecution also made improper remarks during closing argument, which were designed to provoke a mistrial. This type of misconduct is similar to the type of misconduct found in United States v. Leonard, 593 F.2d 951, 954 (10th Cir. 1979), where the prosecution's closing argument was found to be improper and designed to provoke a mistrial.

In conclusion, the intentional misconduct of the prosecutor during the trial of Joseph Beringer raises questions about the propriety of retrial. The prosecution's cross-examination of Harvey Webb was marked by repeated and unfounded attacks on Webb's credibility and integrity, and the prosecution's misconduct was designed to provoke a mistrial. The court must examine the record to determine whether the prosecution's misconduct was

gold_text: The court also finds it significant that the trial judge did not declare a mistrial. Even absent a motion from petitioner, the trial judge certainly would have declared a mistrial if he determined the prosecutor was intentionally conducting improper cross-examination in order to get a mistrial. Respondents argue that because the trial court did not declare a mistrial, this case is markedly dissimilar to Kennedy, in which the trial judge did order a mistrial. Respondents maintain that the ruling in Kennedy should not be extended to situations where, as here, the case is reversed for prosecutorial misconduct; they argue that a double jeopardy claim under Kennedy should be available only where the trial court declares a mistrial. The court rejects respondents’ position. Adopting respondents’ interpretation of Kennedy would make a defendant’s constitutional right to claim double jeopardy dependent on whether the trial court correctly recognizes that a mistrial is in order — a fact wholly outside the power of the defendant. This court, in accord with other courts discussing the issue, fails to see any justification for such a rule. See United States v. Rios, 637 F.2d 728, 729 (10th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 918, 101 S.Ct. 3054, 69 L.Ed.2d 422 (1981); Petrucelli v. Smith, 544 F.Supp. 627, 632-33 (W.D.N.Y.1982), rev’d on other grounds, 735 F.2d 684 (2d Cir.1984). See also United States v. Curtis, 683 F.2d 769, 774-75 (3rd Cir.) (favorably discussing the Rios and Petrucelli approach), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1018, 103 S.Ct. 379, 74 L.Ed.2d 512 (1982). Therefore, the court finds that the trial judge’s failure to declare a mistrial does not preclude petitioner’s double jeopardy claim based on intentional prosecutorial misconduct.
