In Paolino, 71 B.R. at 580, and Catalina Spa, 97 B.R. at 18, the courts found that procuring the appointment of a trustee significantly contributes to the case, thus warranting compensation. Similarly, the instances where services incurred were essential to the progression and benefit of the estate, they align with section 503(b)(3)(D) and (4).

Expenses and fees that qualify under these sections must be scrupulously documented. This approach is reinforced in cases like In re Wildman, 72 B.R. at 731, which mandates detailing every expense as actual, necessary rather than estimates, and emphasizing that non-compensable overhead costs should not be included. The same principles are echoed in cases 103 B.R. 937 and 63 B.R. 495, where fee applications must provide granular details per Bankruptcy Rule 2016 and section 330's standards.

W & Sâ€™s application does not entirely meet necessary documentation and reasonableness in parts, particularly concerning redundant inter-office conferences and non-beneficial activities such as press relations and the trustee's selection process motivated by self-interest. Hence, while a significant portion of W & S's efforts undeniably contributed to the case, specific fees must be adjusted to reflect genuinely compensable services. The Court, therefore, finds merit in partially awarding the claimed fees, particularly those directly tied to the petition and trustee appointment, disallowing non-essential or self-serving expenses as inconsistent with sections 503 and 330.

Accordingly, the Court authorizes payment of fees to W & S in the amount of $23,576.00 and reimbursement of $500.00 in expenses, adjusting for tasks lacking direct estate benefit.

In re Convent Guardian Corp., 103 B.R. 937, 939 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1989); In re Affinito & Son, Inc., 63 B.R. 495, 497 (Bankr.W.D.Pa.1986). The Court will not assume any expense is necessary. See Lindberg Products, 50 B.R. at 221. An expense is necessary if it was incurred because it was required to accomplish the proper representation of the client. Wild-man, 72 B.R. at 731. The Court follows Convent Guardian which sets forth standards that professionals must adhere to when seeking reimbursement of expenses.
