b. Leak’s Motion — Rule 12(b)(6)

Defendants Leak and PCCI move to dismiss Counts V and VI of the Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. As stated in the Erie R.R. v. Tompkins case, 304 U.S. 64, federal courts must apply state law in diversity cases. This principle underscores the necessity of applying Ohio's law to Plaintiff's claims, and hence evaluating the legal sufficiency of such claims under state law norms.

The Plaintiff’s claim for public policy tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress and the related claim must meet the substantive requisites of Ohio’s tort law. In 167 F.3d 309, it is underscored that the burden is on the plaintiff to present evidence consistent with established state laws. Following Fyffe v. Jeno’s, Inc., 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108 (1991), a valid claim for intentional tort by an employer in Ohio necessitates proving a defendant's substantial knowledge and certainty of resultant harm. 

Reviewing Plaintiff’s allegations under these stringent standards, there is an insufficient nexus to substantiate these claims of emotional distress. Plaintiffs have not provided evidentiary support demonstrating that Defendants Leak or PCCI’s actions were wanton, willful, or met the high threshold outlined in Fyffe for workplace intentional torts.

Therefore, given the lack of factual depth aligning with Ohio’s legal standards as per 304 U.S. 64 and 167 F.3d 309, the motion to dismiss Counts V and VI by Defendants Leak and PCCI is GRANTED.

gold_text: When its jurisdiction is based upon diversity, as is the case here, the Court is in effect a court of the forum state and must apply the substantive law of Ohio. Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); Jandro v. Ohio Edison Co., 167 F.3d 309, 313 (6th Cir.1999). A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) therefore requires application of Ohio substantive law to determine whether the plaintiffs complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiff here seeks damages for “intentional infliction of emotional distress” and “public policy tort,” arising out of conduct alleged to have been committed by Leak and PCCI. The Complaint does not state sufficient facts upon which relief can be granted on these claims, and Counts V and VI must therefore be dismissed.
