IV. Cruel and Unusual Punishment
The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment. Bonner claims that the denial of a qualified interpreter at prison hearings and disciplinary proceedings constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The Supreme Court has held that the Eighth Amendment is not applicable to prison conditions or treatment that are merely uncomfortable or inconvenient. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 2400, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981). The Court has also held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits only punishments that are "so extreme as to be shocking to the conscience." Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 373, 30 S.Ct. 544, 552, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910).

In 679 F.2d 1115, a prisoner challenged the conditions in a Texas prison, alleging that they constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the conditions were unconstitutional, but only because they were "so extreme as to be shocking to the conscience." Similarly, in 688 F.2d 266, a prisoner challenged the conditions in a New York prison, alleging that they were cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the conditions were not unconstitutional because they were not "so extreme as to be shocking to the conscience."

In Bonner's case, the denial of a qualified interpreter at prison hearings and disciplinary proceedings is not "so extreme as to be shocking to the conscience." The prison officials' refusal to provide a qualified interpreter is not a punishment, but rather a failure to provide a necessary accommodation. Therefore, the denial of a qualified interpreter does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.

Conclusion
In conclusion, Bonner's claims under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1871 are not barred by the statute of limitations. The district court's grant of summary judgment on these claims is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. The district court's grant of summary judgment on Bonner's equal protection claim is affirmed.
