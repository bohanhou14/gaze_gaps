Based on the cases mentioned, particularly 767 F.2d 1025, the Court has the authority to issue an anti-suit injunction to protect its own jurisdiction and ensure a complete adjudication of the matter before it. However, such an order is an extraordinary remedy that should be used sparingly and only after other means of obtaining the records have been explored.

In this case, the Court has already ordered the defendant to terminate the Cayman litigation, which is a more drastic measure. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Court would issue an anti-suit injunction at this stage.

Additionally, the Dow Jones factors suggest that the Court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case. The litigation is already pending in the Argentine Court, and the Court has already had the opportunity to make its own decision. The Court should defer to the corresponding interests and laws of the foreign tribunal and decline to assert jurisdiction.

In conclusion, based on the cases and the Dow Jones factors, the Court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case and allow the Argentine Court to continue to hear the matter. An anti-suit injunction is unlikely to be issued at this stage, as the Court has already ordered the defendant to terminate the Cayman litigation. <answer>

The Second Circuit set forth its test for determining whether to enjoin foreign litigation in China Trade & Development Corp. v. M.V. Choong Yong, 837 F.2d 33 (2d Cir. 1987). The Court cautioned that “because such an order effectively restricts the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign, ... an anti-foreign-suit injunction should be ‘used sparingly.’” Id. at 35-36 (quoting United States v. Davis, 767 F.2d 1025, 1038 (2d Cir. 1985)).
