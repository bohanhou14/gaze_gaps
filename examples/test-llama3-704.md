The issue in this case revolves around the question of whether severance pay must be provided to employees whose corporate subdivision is sold in its entirety to a purchasing corporation. The district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, and we affirm.

The pertinent ERISA provision is section 3(21)(A), which defines a fiduciary as a person who exercises discretionary authority or control respecting management of a plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets. The Court views the complaint as alleging facts that, if proven, would show the defendants to be fiduciaries within the meaning of ERISA ยง 3(21)(A), as discussed in the recent Law Review article on the subject (Reference case 587 F.2d 453).

The key issue is whether the facts present a "special situation" as defined in the Plan. The Plan provides that severance pay shall not be applicable in any special situation where the Corporate Management Committee deems it necessary to establish a separate policy applicable to that situation only. The Court finds that the sale of REN was such a special situation, as discussed in Reference case 88 F.R.D. 153.

Ease, the Ciba-Geigy executive, testified that he decided that plaintiffs were not entitled to severance pay because no "termination" was involved, and because the Plan specifically exempted "special situations" from its provisions. The Court concludes that Ease's decision was not arbitrary and capricious, as plaintiffs were never "terminated" in the sense that their employer-employee relationship was terminated, and the sale of REN was a "special situation" as defined in the Plan.

In conclusion, the Court affirms the district court's grant of summary judgment, finding that the sale of REN was a "special situation" as defined in the Plan, and that the defendants, as fiduciaries, acted reasonably in denying severance pay to the plaintiffs.

Thus whatever his title, or whether he was named as a fiduciary or not, Ease was acting as a fiduciary when making his no severance pay determination. โข
