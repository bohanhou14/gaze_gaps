**Generation:**

Given the circumstances and the applicable law, we must align our decision with precedents and legal standards. The standard for reassessing previously granted relief from an automatic stay, as cited in reference case *851 F.2d 81, U.S., 107 S.Ct. 3214, 96 L.Ed.2d 701 (1987)*, reaffirms that a creditor can set and enforce policies even after a debt discharge, provided no unfairness to the debtor occurs. Here, the Debtor's request seems an 11th-hour attempt to delay proceedings without substantive change in circumstances. Crucially, like the lending policies discussed in *93 B.R. 859*, there is an essential balance between protecting creditor rights and enforcing contractual obligations, which the Debtor’s current actions disrupt.

Moreover, the equitable considerations and criteria from *878 F.2d 693, 701 (3d Cir.1989)* elucidate that extraordinary relief under § 105(a) should be rarely granted, emphasizing timely requests and proper equity constellations. The Debtor's dilatory approach and speculative valuation of the Premises as $10,000, without empirical support, fail to meet feasibility criteria for a Chapter 13 plan restructure. The Debtor's belated filing of a Modified Plan does not modify the first consideration that adequate protection for the creditor must be evidenced.

In conclusion, weighed against the standards set forth in the referenced cases, the lack of substantial change in circumstances and the improbability of the Debtor’s plan make it evident that relief from the automatic stay should not be reinstated.

gold_text: We therefore conclude that the Debtor cannot possibly prevail in the main thrust of this action. We note that, secondarily, the Debtor avers that the Defendant is violating the automatic stay by retaining the check. We reject this claim for two reasons. First, the disposition of this check appears to be within the scope of matters “in reference to” the Premises, concerning which we granted relief on September 8, 1989, and which result we decline to alter here. Secondly, the Defendant is merely serving as custodian of a check which is worthless unless and until both drawees agree to negotiate it. Whether the check is in the possession of the Defendant or the Debtor or some third party is of no great significance. A trivial or technical violation of the stay is not actionable. See Brown v. Pennsylvania State Employees Credit Union, 851 F.2d 81, 84-85 (3d Cir.1988). A refusal to turn over the proceeds of a disputed claim to a debtor is not a violation of the automatic stay, but merely creates a potential post-petition obligation of the holder of the property to the debtor. See In re TM Carlton House Partners, Ltd., 93 B.R. 859, 870 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1988).
