In the present case, the plaintiff, Roger Eight, was terminated by AutoZone, Inc. for alleged misconduct. Eight alleged that he was fired due to age discrimination and retaliation for keeping a record of his supervisor's age-related comments. The district court denied AutoZone's motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial, and AutoZone appeals.

In the case of 228 F.3d 872, the court held that a plaintiff must present sufficient evidence to show that the employer intentionally discriminated against them. Similarly, in the case of 161 F.3d 491, the court held that an employer may be liable for age discrimination if it knows or shows reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct is prohibited by the statute.

In the present case, Eight presented evidence that his supervisor, Steve Sinor, made age-related comments and launched an investigation that led to his termination. Eight also testified that he was not given a written disciplinary warning before his termination, despite having received a warning in 1998 for using abusive language. The jury found that AutoZone had discriminated against Eight and that its conduct was willful, resulting in a verdict for Eight.

AutoZone argues that the district court erred in excluding Eight's 1998 CAR and the CARs and termination notices of other employees. However, the district court concluded that these documents were not relevant because they were not consulted in AutoZone's decision to terminate Eight, and they lacked context. The court also concluded that the employees whose CARs and termination notices were excluded were not similarly situated to Eight.

In conclusion, the district court's decision to deny AutoZone's motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial is affirmed. The evidence presented by Eight was sufficient to show that AutoZone had discriminated against him due to his age, and the jury's verdict was supported by the evidence. The willfulness instruction was also proper, and the district court did not err in submitting it to the jury.

gold_text: AutoZone finally argues that there was insufficient evidence in support of the verdict so the district court should have granted its motion for judgment as a matter of law. Denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law is reviewed de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. Belk v. City of Eldon, 228 F.3d 872, 878 (8th Cir.2000). The standard of review for sufficiency of proof in an age discrimination suit is “whether [the plaintiff] produced sufficient evidence to allow a jury reasonably to find that [the employer] intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of his age.” Denesha v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, 161 F.3d 491, 497 (8th Cir.1998) (citation omitted).
