 <answer> The cases cited in the reference articles are significant in understanding the scope of the allegations in a complaint and the notice requirements of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). In case 522 F.2d 1235, the court held that the notice of intent to sue filed with the Secretary of Labor must be sufficiently broad to include all allegations made in the subsequent complaint. In case 377 F.2d 239, the court found that the notice requirements of the ADEA are jurisdictional in nature and must be complied with in order for an ADEA suit to be maintainable.

In the present case, the plaintiff's notice of intent to sue did not comply with the notice requirements of the ADEA. The notice simply stated that the plaintiff was discharged due to his age, without specifying the discriminatory practices or policies that led to the discharge. As a result, the court held that the plaintiff's claims for retaliation and terms and conditions were not properly before the court.

Furthermore, the court held that exemplary and compensatory damages are not available under the ADEA. The court cited Rogers v. Exxon Research & Engineering Co., 550 F.2d 834 (3d Cir. 1976), and Sant v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 424 F.Supp. 621 (N.D.Cal. 1976), which held that such damages are inconsistent with the purposes of the ADEA. The court also noted that the ADEA provides for liquidated damages in cases of willful violations, which is a form of punitive damages.

In conclusion, the cases cited in the reference articles demonstrate the importance of complying with the notice requirements of the ADEA and the limitations on the types of damages that can be recovered under the Act. The court's decision in this case is consistent with the principles set forth in these cases. <answer>
