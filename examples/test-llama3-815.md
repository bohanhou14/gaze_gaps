In the context of these legal cases, it's essential to consider the jurisdictional powers of the district courts. As illustrated in case 294 U.S. 648, the district court has exclusive jurisdiction over reorganization proceedings, and it's crucial to ensure that the court has the authority to send its process into any state when necessary to effectuate the purposes of the law. This jurisdictional power is particularly relevant in cases involving multiple states and districts, as seen in the Rock Island system's extensive rail network.

In the case of Franklin Garden Apartments, Inc., the district court's decision to award possession of the mortgaged premises to the trustee is supported by Sections 256 and 257 of the Chandler Act. These sections were enacted to avoid the limitations imposed on Section 77B(i) in cases where a receiver in foreclosure is sought to be superseded by a trustee in a 77B proceeding.

However, the court's decision to apply the rents to the payment of "expenses of administration in this proceeding" may be subject to challenge. As mentioned in case 113 F.2d 45, the district court's jurisdiction is limited to the property wherever located, and the court must have the power to preserve and safeguard the property for the benefit of the trust estate. In this case, the mortgagee's rights are not fully secured, and the use of rentals derived from the property to pay expenses of administration may not be justified.

Ultimately, the court's decision must be guided by the principles of equity, fairness, and adequate protection of the mortgagee's rights. As stated in Section 216(7) of the Chandler Act, the plan of reorganization must provide for adequate protection for the realization by creditors of the value of their claims against the property dealt with by the plan. In this case, the court must carefully balance the interests of the mortgagee and the general creditors to ensure that the rights of all parties are respected and protected.

gold_text: Since the decision in Continental Illinois Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & P. Ry. Co., 294 U.S. 648, 675, 55 S.Ct. 595, 79 L.Ed. 1110, we have no doubt of the power of the district court to take possession of the mortgaged premises, collect the rents and enjoin the mortgagee from interfering therewith. Clark Bros. Co. v. Portex Oil Co., 9 Cir., 113 F.2d 45, 47. We cannot know what further may be done until the submission of a plan of reorganization or the failure to achieve one. It is possible that one may be proposed which will leave a sufficient equity to justify the application of rental receipts to expenses of the proceeding and to the completion of building and procurement of equipment. It may leave the mortgagee in a better position than at present and not meet with any objection.
