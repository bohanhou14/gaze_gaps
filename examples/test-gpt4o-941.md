**Generation:**

The Howes argue that the district court should have reconsidered the extent of the res judicata bar on their lender liability claims. We find this argument unpersuasive. As established in Cromwell v. County of Sac (94 U.S. 351, 352, 24 L.Ed. 195), res judicata prohibits relitigation of claims that were or could have been raised in prior proceedings. In this context, the principle underscores the integrity of the bankruptcy court's judgment (Reference case 462 F.2d 358). Similarly, the issues contended by the Howes are identical to those previously adjudicated, making them subject to res judicata, as confirmed in Mitchell v. Village Creek Drainage Dist. (158 F.2d 475, 478).

Additionally, analogizing to the decisions in Burgess v. Nail, 10 Cir. (103 F.2d 37, 43-44), a court of general jurisdiction has conclusively determined its jurisdiction over the matter, and the Howes are barred from relitigating these concerns in federal court (Reference case 349 F.2d 595). The Howes' failure to raise their lender liability claims during the extensive adversarial bankruptcy proceedings further precludes them from bringing these claims now. Thus, the district court did not err in applying res judicata to dismiss the Howes' claims.
