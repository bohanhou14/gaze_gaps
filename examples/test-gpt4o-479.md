Darwin's allegation that the termination for default was arbitrary and capricious finds substantial support in established case law. In Schlesinger v. United States, 390 F.2d 702, 709, 182 Ct.Cl. 571 (1968), the Court held that discretion in decisions under the default article of contracts must be reasonably exercised, and administrative termination decisions made without proper judgment, but merely as a device, should not be sanctioned. This principle is echoed in 17 How. 344, where the arbitration awards, serving as final judgments, should not be overturned unless fraud or gross error indicating fraud is evident. Similarly, the application of "well-nigh irrefragable proof," as emphasized in Kalvar Corp. v. United States, 543 F.2d 1298, 211 Ct.Cl. 192 (1976), is pertinent here. Furthermore, the judgment must not be capricious or in bad faith as established in 223 U.S. 695, where it was held that agency judgment must be exercised reasonably and with due regard to the rights of contracting parties, particularly in light of allegations of bad faith judgment by the contracting officer. Thus, we conclude that the Board's initial decision to convert the termination for default into one for convenience was correct and should be reinstated. Consequently, the Board's amended decision is hereby reversed.

gold_text: In innumerable cases it has been held that where discretion is conferred on an administrative officer to render a decision, this decision must be honestly rendered, and that if it is arbitrary or capricious, or rendered in bad faith, the courts have power to review it and set it aside. This court has this question presented to it constantly in cases arising under Government contracts, where the contracting officer and the head of the department are given the power to render final decisions on questions of fact. Both this Court and the Supreme Court have many times held that if the decision is arbitrary or capricious or so grossly erroneous as to imply bad faith, it will be set aside. See, e.g. Burchell v. Marsh, 17 How. 344, 349, [15 L.Ed. 96], Kihlbert v. United States, 97 U.S. [Otto] 398 [24 L.Ed. 1106]; United States v. Gleason, 175 U.S. 588, 602 [20 S.Ct. 228, 233, 44 L.Ed. 284]; Ripley v. United States, 223 U.S. 695, 701 [32 S.Ct. 352, 355, 56 L.Ed. 614].
