Penson argued that the trial court's refusal to sever his trial from Surratt's denied him a fair trial. Specifically, Penson claimed that evidence presented against Surratt unduly prejudiced the jury against him. However, under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14, severance is warranted only if there is a clear showing of actual prejudice. The reference case 756 F.2d 600 states that to obtain a severance, defendants must demonstrate that they will be unable to obtain a fair trial without severance, not merely that a separate trial offers a better chance of acquittal. Here, Penson failed to show substantial prejudice that would warrant a severance. 

Penson's motion for acquittal was also reviewed, particularly examining the sufficiency of evidence presented against him. As articulated in reference case 581 F.2d 681, the trial court must determine if there was relevant evidence from which a reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The government placed ample evidence by multiple witnesses corroborating Penson's involvement in the conspiracy, meeting the threshold for denying the acquittal motion. 

Thus, the trial court's decisions to deny Penson's motions for severance and acquittal were not abuses of discretion. Both decisions align with precedents establishing the deferment shown to trial judges unless clear judicial errors can be demonstrated. Accordingly, Penson's conviction stands.

gold_text: Defendant Penson contends that he was unduly prejudiced by the trial court’s refusal to sever his trial from that of Harley Surratt. He also argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Both of these arguments are based on Penson’s assertion that his activities were unconnected, in time and in manner, to those of Harley Surratt and to the rest of the conspiracy. A decision not to sever the trials of co-defendants is one within the sound discretion of the trial court and should be overturned only if it is found to be a clear abuse of discretion.

The standard of review of a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 is “whether at the time of the motion there was relevant evidence from which the jury could reasonably find [the defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt_” United States v.
