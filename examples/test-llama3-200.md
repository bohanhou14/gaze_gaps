III. SENTENCING AND RESTITUTION
The district court imposed a sentence of 79 months in prison for Rodriguez and 120 months in prison for Marcov. Rodriguez and Marcov both appeal their sentences, arguing that the district court erred in its calculation of the restitution and in its imposition of the sentences.

Regarding the restitution, Rodriguez argues that he should not be jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the loss, as he was not actively involved in the criminal enterprise during certain periods of time. However, the district court found that Rodriguez was responsible for the entire amount of the loss, as he knew that his crew leader, Marcov, was active during those periods. This finding is supported by the testimony of the police officer, which indicated that Marcov was involved in each transaction during the time frame he was involved in the conspiracy.

Marcov, on the other hand, argues that he did not cause the entire loss attributed to him, and that the district court should have granted him a minor-role downward departure instead of an upward departure. However, the district court's finding that Marcov was a supervisor in the scheme is supported by the testimony of the police officer, which indicated that Marcov recruited and supervised at least nine runners.

In reviewing the district court's sentencing and restitution orders, we apply an abuse-of-discretion standard. United States v. Feemster, 572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir. 2009) (en banc). We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentences and ordering the restitution.

Rodriguez's challenge to the restitution order is without merit, as the district court's finding that he was responsible for the entire amount of the loss is supported by the evidence. Marcov's challenge to the sentence is also without merit, as the district court's finding that he was a supervisor in the scheme is supported by the evidence.

Accordingly, we affirm the district court's sentences and restitution orders.

gold_text: Finally, Marcov challenges his sentence as substantively unreasonable, which claim we review for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Feemster, 572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir. 2009) (en banc). The district court abuses its discretion if it fails to consider a relevant factor that should have instead received significant weight, gives significant weight to an improper factor, or considers appropriate factors but commits a clear error of judgment in weighing those factors. United States v. Long, 906 F.3d 720, 727 (8th Cir. 2018). We have reviewed the record, including the sentencing transcript and presentence investigation report, and find no abuse of discretion. Here, the district court considered all of the relevant factors, did not give weight to any improper factor, and did not commit a clear error in judgment.
