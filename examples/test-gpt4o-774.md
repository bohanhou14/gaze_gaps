The district court's actions in this case align with established precedents regarding affirmative defenses and summary judgment. Under F.R.Civ.P. 8(c), a party must affirmatively plead all intended defenses; failure to do so constitutes a waiver of those defenses (518 F.2d 292). Golden’s failure to provide adequate responses falls within this domain since it did not substantiate its defense with specific evidence, thus waiving it.

Additionally, in Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Station KYFM, Inc. (424 F.2d 14), it is asserted that failure to raise an affirmative defense precludes it from being considered at trial. Here, Golden’s general denial without specifics similarly barred them from contesting Exxon’s claims effectively.

Furthermore, the principle that new theories or defenses cannot be raised on appeal, as established in Wolf v. Frank (477 F.2d 467), supports the district court’s striking of Golden’s defense when it attempted to introduce issues not properly raised in the lower court.

In the context of summary judgment, precedents like Olympic Ins. Co. v. H. D. Harrison, Inc. (418 F.2d 669) and Lawhorn v. Atlantic Refining Co. (299 F.2d 353) confirm that detailed, uncontradicted statements suffice for summary judgment when the opposing party fails to show specific disputable facts, which was the case here with Golden.

Thus, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED consistent with these precedents.

While the district court could have heard these defenses, Golden first sought to raise them in its brief in this court. As affirmative defenses, Golden waived them by neglecting to raise them.
