OPINION

The Commissioner determined a deficiency of $6,490.35 in the Federal estate tax of the Estate of Donald E. Lester. The sole issue is the proper amount of a deduction otherwise allowable under section 2053 for the claim of Lester's ex-wife against the estate for monthly payments fixed under a decree of divorce.

The estate's obligation to the decedent's ex-wife is the commuted value at the date of death of the installments which had not yet become due. This is similar to the principle announced in Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 151 (1939), where the Supreme Court held that the estate's obligation to a life tenant's estate is the commuted value at the date of death of the installments which had not yet become due.

The computation of the allowable deduction under the provisions of Federal Estate Tax Regulations section 20.2031-7(a) and (e) follows. For 9 years from the decedent's death, the actuarial tables show a present value of $89,456.16. Adding 3 months at $1,000.00 per month results in a total commuted value of $92,456.16.

The Commissioner contends that the amount of the estate's obligation to the decedent's ex-wife is the commuted value at the date of death of the installments which had not yet become due. This is supported by Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 151 (1929), and Estate Tax Regulations section 20.2031-7(e).

Accordingly, we hold that the estate is entitled to a deduction of $92,456.16 for the claim of Lester's ex-wife against the estate. This deduction is computed in accordance with Federal Estate Tax Regulations section 20.2031-7(a) and (e), and is supported by the principle announced in Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 151 (1939), and Estate Tax Regulations section 20.2031-7(e).

gold_text: The Ithaca Trust Co. case indeed establishes the general principle that we must apply, if, as in the case before us, on the date of death the estateâ€™s obligation is one which will 'be satisfied in the future. The use of actuarial tables such as those found in section 20.2031-7, Estate Tax Regs., to ascertain the value of such a claim, especially when it is periodic in nature, has been the administrative and judicial norm for many years. Estate of Pompeo M. Maresi, 6 T.C. 582, 586 (1946), affirmed sub nom. Commissioner v. Maresi, 156 F. 2d 929 (C.A. 2, 1946); Estate of Francis Browne Grinnell, 44 B.T.A. 1286, 1288 (1941), modified sub nom. Commissioner v. State Street T. Co., 128 F. 2d 618 (C.A. 1, 1942); Estate of Reginald L. Taylor, 39 T.C. 371, 374 (1962), affirmed sub nom. Gowetz v. Commissioner, 320 F. 2d 874 (C.A. 1, 1963); Rev. Rul. 67-304, 1967-2 C.B. 224.
