The case presented involves a civil rights lawsuit filed by James Tooley against Officer David S. Young and the City of Konawa, alleging false arrest and excessive force. Tooley claims that Young was involved in his arrest and used excessive force during the incident.

The court granted summary judgment in favor of Young, concluding that he did not violate Tooley's constitutional rights. The court found that Tooley failed to establish a clearly established constitutional violation and that Young's actions were not objectively unreasonable.

In reaching its decision, the court relied on the principles established in reference cases such as 896 F.2d 1228, where the court held that a plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were objectively unreasonable to establish a constitutional violation. The court also cited reference case 715 F.3d 775, which established that a plaintiff must show an actual, non-de minimis injury to establish an excessive force claim.

The court further found that Young's actions were reasonable and did not constitute a constitutional violation. The court noted that Young was simply doing his job and did not use excessive force against Tooley.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant summary judgment in favor of Young was proper. Tooley failed to establish a clearly established constitutional violation and did not show an actual, non-de minimis injury. The court's decision is consistent with the principles established in reference cases such as 896 F.2d 1228 and 715 F.3d 775.

gold_text: The district judge denied reconsideration of the summary judgment because Tooley merely reiterated his earlier arguments. He does not address the denial in his briefs; we deem the issue waived. See Abercrombie v. City of Catoosa, 896 F.2d 1228, 1231 (10th Cir.1990). In any event it was not an abuse of discretion.
