**Generation:**

In the present case, defendants argue that the District Court’s decision to grant a "relation back amendment" under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c) is separable from the remand order and therefore reviewable under the precedent set by City of Waco, 293 U.S. 140, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934). They contend that this collateral order independently affects the parties’ rights and should thus be subject to appellate review despite the general bar in 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d).

We addressed a similar contention in Powers v. Southland Corp., 4 F.3d 223 (3d Cir.1993), where defendants submitted that the court’s decision to allow a relation back amendment was separable from the remand order. However, we dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction because the order was not final under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Likewise, in City of Waco (17 F.3d 671), the separability and logical precedence of an order affecting the parties' substantive rights were criteria for reviewability, but this was in the context of independent rights rather than mere procedural grounds. 

Here, the defendants’ procedural objections—whether concerning service issues or alleged fraudulent joinder—do not confer independent substantive effects apart from the remand decision. As such, the District Court’s order remains fundamentally grounded in procedural defect under § 1447(c), rendering it non-reviewable by this court in accordance with § 1447(d). The precedents in 4 F.3d 223 and 17 F.3d 671 support this conclusion, as the amendment and separability arguments do not alter the remand’s procedural nature.

Thus, our review is barred, reaffirming the District Court’s procedural remand decision.

gold_text: Following Waco, we have held that “a district court cannot prevent appellate review of a final collateral order by contemporaneously remanding a case to state court.... Such an order, however, must satisfy two separate jurisdictional requirements. First, it must avoid the bar to appellate review in 28 U.S.C. 1447(d). Second, it must satisfy the finality requirement of 28 U.S.C. 1291.” Carr v. American Red Cross, 17 F.3d 671, 675 (3d Cir. 1994) (citing Powers v. Southland Corp., 4 F.3d 223, 226 (3d Cir.1993). Under the first prong, “the order must be both logically precedent to, and separable from, the remand decision.” Id. Defendants contend that the District Court’s remand is “based on its finding that Sud Voyages and Palm Tours actually are defendants in this litigation. The decision is the substantive decision on which the remand depends. If that decision is incorrect, the remand is incorrect. Thus the District Court’s remand order is reviewable.” Grey Br. at 5. This argument is unavailing.
