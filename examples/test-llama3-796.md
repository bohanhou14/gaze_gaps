Petitioners Arsenio and Victoria Marquez, husband and wife, are seeking political asylum or withholding of deportation from the Philippines. They claim that their lives would be threatened if they return to their home country due to their political opinion. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denied their application, ruling that they did not experience past persecution or have a well-founded fear of future persecution.

The BIA's decision is consistent with the precedent set in Sarvia-Quintanilla v. INS, 767 F.2d 1387, 1394 (9th Cir.1985), which states that conditions of political upheaval which affect the populace as a whole or in large part are generally insufficient to establish eligibility for asylum. The BIA's decision is also consistent with the ruling in Sivaainkaran, 972 F.2d 161, which highlights the importance of considering the current state of affairs in the country of origin.

In this case, the BIA noted that the alleged persecution occurred over eight years ago, and the couple's family has lived in the Philippines without incident throughout this time. The BIA also found that the alleged persecution was not on account of political opinion, but rather due to personal reasons. The court affirms the BIA's decision, citing the precedent set in Cudahy, 77 F.3d 1015, which emphasizes the importance of considering the objective reasonableness of an applicant's fears.

The court concludes that the petitioners have not shown that they have experienced past persecution or have a well-founded fear of future persecution, and therefore, their application for asylum and withholding of deportation is denied. The court's decision is consistent with the precedent set in Cardoza-Fonseca v. INS, 480 U.S. 421, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 484 (1987), which emphasizes the importance of considering the objective reasonableness of an applicant's fears.

gold_text: The INS urges that generalized conditions of corruption in a country are very much like civil strife, which cannot justify asylum for all its victims. “ ‘[Cjonditions of political upheaval which affect the populace as a whole or in large part are generally insufficient to establish eligibility for asylum.’ ” Gonzalez v. INS, 77 F.3d 1015, 1021 (7th Cir.1996) (quoting Sivaainkaran v. INS, 972 F.2d 161, 165 (7th Cir.1992)). On the same rationale as for political upheaval, we understand that not every victim of corruption can qualify for political asylum. Several billion human beings might otherwise be eligible for asylum in the United States or any other state subscribing to the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. See supra note 2.
