The distinction between state and federal service of National Guard members has been addressed in several cases. For instance, in the case referenced as 127 F.3d 1255, the court highlighted that Guardsmen serving in state capacity do not fall under the constraints of the Posse Comitatus Act, which applies to federal military forces. Specifically, the court in United States v. Hutchings emphasized that Guardsmen were acting under state authority during drug interdiction efforts, a critical element for preserving their eligibility for federal funding without violating federal constraints (United States v. Hutchings, No. 93-CR-214G, D.Utah Dec. 11, 1995).

Similarly, in the case referenced as 5 F.3d 20, the court underscored that the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to state National Guard units when not in federal service. It was noted that operational legality and funding provisions under 32 U.S.C. § 112 do not inherently restrict the National Guard from conducting state-authorized law enforcement activities, as long as they are not federalized (32 U.S.C. § 112(d)).

These precedents support the interpretation that Mr. Clark, serving under state authority as a member of the Alabama National Guard and not in federal service, should not be excluded from compensation under 37 U.S.C. § 206(d). This distinction aligns with the dual status principle established in Perpich v. Department of Defense, further reinforcing that National Guard members’ federal service is context-dependent.

gold_text: The Posse Comitatus Act also supports the proposition that membership in a state National Guard and in the National Guard of .the United States represent different activities. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of “any part of the Army or Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws.... ” 18 U.S.C. § 1385. The Act has been uniformly interpreted to apply to National Guard members only when they are in federal service and not when they are in service to their states. United States v. Hutchings, 127 F.3d 1255, 1257-58 (10th Cir.1997) (“But until a Guardsman receives orders directing him into federal service, he is a state serviceman, and not a part of the federal Army.”); United States v. Benish, 5 F.3d 20, 25-26 (3d Cir.1993) (holding that Pennsylvania National Guard members could be used for civilian law enforcement because they were not in federal service at the time). Case law thus establishes that when National Guard members are not activated into federal service, they are not treated as federal employees. To include a National Guard member in a reserve component for the purposes of section 206(d) when he is in service to the state National Guard would be to treat that member as a federal employee, and not as a state serviceman, and would be contrary to that law.
