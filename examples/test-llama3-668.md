The exclusionary rule in federal probationary hearings has been a topic of debate among courts. In this case, we join seven other circuits in holding that the exclusionary rule is not applicable in federal probationary hearings.

The case of 712 F.2d 826, United States v. Turkish, suggests that the burden of proving an independent source for the evidence is substantial and may result in the loss of potentially crucial evidence. Similarly, 581 F.2d 711, United States v. Vandemark, holds that the fourth amendment exclusionary rule is inapplicable to probation revocation proceedings.

In 518 F.2d 51, United States v. Winsett, the court found that the exclusionary rule was not applicable to a subsequent probation revocation proceeding. The court noted that the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct, but that this deterrence is adequately served by the exclusion of the unlawfully seized evidence in the criminal prosecution.

The case of 512 F.2d 160, United States v. Farmer, suggests that the exclusionary rule is not necessary in probation revocation proceedings because the need for deterrence is derived from experience and that, at least, on the factual situation, experience has dictated no necessity for deterrence.

In 447 F.2d 817, United States v. Hill, the court agreed with the government that the exclusionary rule is not applicable to parole revocation proceedings because there is no need for double application of the exclusionary rule. The court noted that parolees are not without constitutional rights and that instances of police harassment can be treated as they arise.

Finally, 426 F.2d 1161, United States v. Corail, suggests that the exclusionary rule is not applicable in federal probationary hearings because the deterrence purpose of the exclusionary rule is adequately served by the exclusion of the unlawfully seized evidence in the criminal prosecution. The court noted that the police officers who subjected the parolee to the unlawful search may be subjected to both federal and state penalties.

In this case, we hold that the exclusionary rule is not applicable in federal probationary hearings. We agree with the majority of circuits that the exclusionary rule is not necessary in probation revocation proceedings because the need for deterrence is derived from experience and that, at least, on the factual situation, experience has dictated no necessity for deterrence.
