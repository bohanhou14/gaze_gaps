In the context of Rule 25(a) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the suggestion of death is a crucial step in the process of substituting a deceased party with a proper representative. However, not all suggestions of death are created equal. In cases where the suggestion of death is made by a party's attorney, but fails to identify a successor or representative of the deceased, the 90-day period for substitution may not be triggered.

As noted in 359 F.2d 292, the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules intended to provide a more flexible standard for substitution, allowing for extensions of time and dispensing with the rigid two-year period previously in place. However, this flexibility is contingent upon the suggestion of death providing sufficient information to permit the court to proceed with substitution.

In the present case, the suggestion of death made by the defendant's attorney was deficient in that it failed to identify a successor or representative of the deceased. This lack of specificity rendered the suggestion ineffective in triggering the 90-day period for substitution, as explained in 379 F.2d 94.

Furthermore, the court's discretion to enlarge the time period for substitution, as provided by Rule 6(b), is not a blank check. Rather, it is intended to be exercised in a judicious and reasonable manner, taking into account the particular circumstances of each case.

In light of these principles, we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the action with prejudice. The case should be remanded for further proceedings, allowing the parties to properly substitute a representative of the deceased and continue the action in a manner consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
