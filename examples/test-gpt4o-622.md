In evaluating dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) without leave to amend, we consider precedents like Shemtob v. Shearson, Hammill & Co., 448 F.2d 442 (2d Cir. 1971). There, the court distinguished between ordinary breach of contract claims and those alleging violations under § 10(b) of the Exchange Act, emphasizing the requirement of specific allegations demonstrating scienter or intent to defraud. The Shemtob court dismissed the complaint due to failure to allege facts indicating such intent, analogous to the current lack of specific wrongdoing attributed to CNB.

Furthermore, in 86 F.R.D. 66, the necessity of scienter for § 10(b) claims is reinforced, asserting that mere negligence does not suffice. The allegations against CNB in Count 8 do not include facts depicting any intent to defraud or reckless disregard for the truth, merely claiming liability through association with Rawlings’ account.

Given these precedents, the Funds' claims fail to meet the requisite pleading standards outlined in Rule 9(b) and the intent component essential for securities fraud claims under Rule 10b-5. The court rightfully dismissed with prejudice, as amendments were unlikely to cure the fundamental deficiency—no fact-based assertions connecting CNB to the fraudulent scheme.

Thus, consistent with the reasoning in the cited cases and the necessity for particularity in fraud claims, the district court's dismissal stands affirmed.

gold_text: Count 8 failed to state a cause of action because it alleged only that Rawlings held the agency account at CNB. It failed to allege any facts demonstrating knowledge and participation sufficient to impose liability on the bank. Under similar circumstances, when a complaint failed to al lege the required scienter, it was properly dismissed with prejudice. Shemtob v. Shearson, Hammill & Co., 448 F.2d 442 (2d Cir. 1971); Greene v. Emersons, Ltd., 86 F.R.D. 66 (S.D.N.Y.1980).
