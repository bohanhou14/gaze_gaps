IV. Reconsideration

Tooley also appeals the district court’s denial of his motion for reconsideration. We review the district court’s decision for abuse of discretion. As explained in Ysais v. Richardson, 603 F.3d 1175, 1180 (10th Cir.2010), and consistent with the reasoning in Manzanares v. City Of Albuquerque, 628 F.3d 1237, 1240 (10th Cir.2010), denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion, or a Rule 60(b) motion, is subject to this standard.

In Tooley's Rule 59(e) motion, he sought reconsideration of the summary judgment ruling, arguing, much like the Muskrats in 715 F.3d 775, new grounds for evaluating his § 1983 claim. Just as the Muskrats could not introduce new claims for the first time post-summary judgment, Tooley’s late attempt to bring in arguments was not appropriate. Thus, the district court acted within its discretion in denying his motion.

Furthermore, the case's factual and procedural posture mirrors Abercrombie's in 896 F.2d 1228, where summary judgment was upheld due to a lack of substantive evidence supporting the plaintiff's claims. Tooley, likewise, provided insufficient evidence to overturn the judgment.

The district court’s order denying Tooley’s motion for reconsideration is affirmed.

Conclusion

No constitutional rights were violated by Officer Young, and the district court properly granted summary judgment in his favor and denied reconsideration. We affirm the district court’s decisions in all respects.

gold_text: The district judge denied reconsideration of the summary judgment because Tooley merely reiterated his earlier arguments. He does not address the denial in his briefs; we deem the issue waived. See Abercrombie v. City of Catoosa, 896 F.2d 1228, 1231 (10th Cir.1990). In any event it was not an abuse of discretion. Muskrat v. Deer Creek Pub. Sch., 715 F.3d 775, 789 (10th Cir.2013).
