I must agree with the district court's decision to dismiss the case with prejudice, but for different reasons. The first reason is that the plaintiffs failed to show good cause for the failure to serve the defendants within the 120-day period. As stated in Boriboune, 507 F.3d 605, when a plaintiff fails to show good cause for the failure to serve a defendant within the 120-day period, the court may dismiss the claims against that defendant.

Another reason is that the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief under the right-to-organize theory are moot. As stated in Pratt v. Hurley, 79 F.3d 601 (7th Cir. 1996), a plaintiff must show an injury in fact, a sufficient causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, and a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. The plaintiffs in this case have failed to show that their alleged injuries will be redressed by a favorable decision, as the alleged wrongdoing occurred several years ago and the students who were allegedly wronged have since graduated.

Furthermore, the district court correctly found that the remaining claims under federal law were not properly joined in one lawsuit. As stated in Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 1655 (3d ed. 2001), "Rule 20 deals solely with joinder of parties and becomes relevant only when there is more than one party on one or both sides of the action." The district court correctly found that the claims were not properly joined and therefore dismissed them with prejudice.

In conclusion, I agree with the district court's decision to dismiss the case with prejudice, but for different reasons. The plaintiffs failed to show good cause for the failure to serve the defendants within the 120-day period, the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief under the right-to-organize theory are moot, and the remaining claims under federal law were not properly joined in one lawsuit.

gold_text: These rules are broad, giving district courts considerable flexibility in managing and structuring civil litigation for fair and efficient resolution of complex disputes. Still, there are limits. "Unrelated claims against different defendants belong in different suits." George v. Smith , 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007). A district judge necessarily has considerable discretion in applying Rules 18 and 20. The rules "operate[ ] independently" because Rule 20 contains limitations that Rule 18 does not, and the Rule 20 inquiry comes first. See Pace v. Timmermann's Ranch & Saddle Shop Inc. , 795 F.3d 748, 755 n.10 (7th Cir. 2015), citing Intercon Research Assocs., Ltd. v. Dresser Industries, Inc. , 696 F.2d 53, 56-57 (7th Cir. 1982) (" Rule 18 becomes relevant only after the requirements of Rule 20 relating to joinder of parties [have] been met").
