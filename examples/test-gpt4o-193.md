**Generation:**

In reviewing the legal sufficiency of probable cause in an affidavit, we refer to the precedent set in Taylor v. Meacham, where the court upheld the finding of probable cause despite false statements in the affidavit (82 F.3d 1556). Applying this standard, we must set aside any false statements in Overton's affidavit and evaluate the remaining content to determine if it still supports probable cause. Similarly, in Cottrell v. Kaysville City, Utah, false statements or omissions were not considered material if the remaining facts still supported probable cause (78 F.3d 484).

Additionally, issues of qualified immunity often hinge on whether the alleged actions violated clearly established law. The Supreme Court in Mitchell clarified that interlocutory appeals in qualified immunity cases should focus on abstract legal issues rather than sufficiency of evidence (515 U.S. 304). In this instance, we lack jurisdiction to review fact-based determinations of evidence sufficiency made by the district court, but we can evaluate the legal sufficiency of the affidavit de novo.

Considering these precedents, we affirm the district court’s denial of summary judgment regarding the false arrest claim, as genuine issues of material fact on the reasonableness of Overton’s actions remain. However, due to the confines of our jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal concerning the issue of false imprisonment, which depends heavily on factual determinations.

Thus, the order is affirmed in part and dismissed in part.

gold_text: Taylor v. Meacham, 82 F.3d 1556, 1561 (10th Cir.1996) (quoting Wolford v. Lasater, 78 F.3d 484, 489 (10th Cir.1996)). In performing the above analysis, we review the revised affidavit de novo and determine its sufficiency as a matter of law. See id. at 1562. Because the sufficiency of the affidavit is a legal issue reviewed de novo, it is the type of issue over which we have jurisdiction in an interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunity. See Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 312-13, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995).
