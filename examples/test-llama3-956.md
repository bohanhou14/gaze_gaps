OPINION

In the case of Salsbury Industries, the court has to decide whether the termination of the contract with the United States Postal Service (USPS) was proper. The contract was terminated for convenience, citing clause 8 of the General Provisions for Fixed Price Contracts. Salsbury argues that the termination was improper because the contracting officer did not make the required determination that termination was in the best interest of the USPS.

The court finds that the contracting officer did make this determination, citing the testimony of the contracting officer that she disagreed with the Doninger decision, but it was beyond her authority to change it. The court also notes that the evidence supports the conclusion that the contracting officer made the determination.

Salsbury also argues that the termination was improper because it was the foreseeable victim of the USPS's illegal conduct in disqualifying Doninger from the solicitation. The court finds that this argument is without merit, citing Torncello v. United States, 231 Ct.Cl. 20, 681 F.2d 756 (1982). The court holds that the USPS did not enter into the contract with Salsbury knowing that it would not honor it, and therefore, the convenience termination clause was properly applied.

In conclusion, the court affirms the decision of the Claims Court, holding that the termination of the contract was proper. The court finds that the contracting officer made the required determination that termination was in the best interest of the USPS, and that the convenience termination clause was properly applied.

gold_text: The Doninger injunction was a proper and sufficient basis for the termination of Salsburyâ€™s contract. This principle is well-recognized. Convenience terminations have been sustained when they were invoked to avoid conflict with other governmental entities. Schlesinger v. United States, 182 Ct.Cl. 571, 390 F.2d 702 (1968) (the Navy deferred to the views of a Senate subcommittee); John Reiner & Co., 325 F.2d 438 (compliance with a General Accounting Office ruling). If deference to the nonbinding views of those political bodies supports a convenience termination, it could hardly be otherwise when the contract is terminated because of an order of a United States district court.
