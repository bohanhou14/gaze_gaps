D. The Court's Discretion under Rule C(6) and Precedent

In the present scenario, Blue Green's failure to file a verified statement in time violates Supplemental Rule C(6), which mandates strict compliance. As established in United States v. Beechcraft Queen Airplane, failure to precede an answer with a verified claim can justify striking the answer and entering default (950 F.2d 1108). The Court has inherent discretion to enforce these rules stringently to maintain procedural integrity.

Similar reasoning was applied in the case of United States v. 1982 Yukon Delta Houseboat, emphasizing expedient claim verification to prevent false assertions and promptly involve all interested parties (82 F.3d 582). The court in 950 F.2d 1108 underscored that delays or failures in compliance could rightfully lead to striking the answer without abusing the court’s discretion.

In light of these precedents, the Court finds substantial grounds for denying the extension request and granting default. Blue Green's counsel's neglect is neither excusable nor sufficiently substantiated, aligning with the judicial conclusions drawn in similar cases. Therefore, the Court will proceed to enforce default against the Jumby Bay.
