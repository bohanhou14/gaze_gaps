**Generation:**

This court must consider whether the listing of the debtor as "Stebow Excavating Co., Inc." rather than "Stebow Construction Co., Inc." on the UCC-1 Financing Statement is "seriously misleading." Precedents show variability in judgments, often dependent on whether the filed name is sufficient to provide reasonable notice to creditors. For example, in **Matter of Glasco, Inc.**, 642 F.2d 793, the court upheld a filing under a trade name as not seriously misleading since the debtor's business dealings were primarily under that trade name. This assessment aligns with other rulings where minor errors were deemed insignificant if a diligent search could uncover the secured interest (see **Excel Stores, Inc.**, **341 F.2d 961 (2d Cir.1965)**).

Conversely, the case of **In re Amsco, Inc.**, 26 B.R. 358 held that utilizing a trade name rather than the corporate name was seriously misleading and undermined the purpose of public notice. Similar reasoning applies in **In re Sportswear Shoppe, Ltd.**, 15 B.R. 970, where listing the names of corporate officers instead of the corporate entity was deemed insufficient to perfect the security interest.

Given the Trustee’s argument and the certificate replacement system's rigidity, this court leans towards the interpretation in **In re McGovern Auto Specialty, Inc.**, **51 B.R. 511 (Bkrtcy.E.D.Pa.1985)**, holding that a properly diligent search utilizing the debtor's correct corporate name standard. 

Therefore, the use of "Stebow Excavating Co., Inc." does not meet the perfection standards set under the relevant statutes and case law, thereby invalidating the secured status of L.B. Smith, Inc.

gold_text: In the present case, the court concludes that the use by L.B. Smith, Inc. of debtor’s trade name, Stebow Excavating Co., Inc., instead of its corporate name, Stebow Construction Co., Inc., in the financing statement is not a minor error and is seriously misleading within the meaning of N.J.S.A. § 12A:9-402(8) (formerly § 12A:9-402(5)), see fn. 2, supra), and that the financing statement does not substantially comply with the requirements of N.J. S.A. § 12A-.9-402. This is not a case where the financing statement merely fails to indicate the debtor is a corporation or uses a word that is basically synonymous with a word in the debtor’s name so that a diligent searcher would be put on notice to make further inquiry or conclude that Stebow Excavating Co., Inc. and Stebow Construction Co., Inc. identify the same entity. According to the stipulated facts herein, Ste-bow Excavating Co., Inc. is an unregistered trade name occasionally utilized by the debtor, so that a diligent searcher would not be more likely to discover this filing then one in the correct name of Stebow Construction Co., Inc. Nor is this a case as in Kittyhawk where there was no error in the original filing statement. Moreover, cases which hold that a creditor who is seeking to avoid a security interest had actual knowledge of the incorrect name on the financing statement so as to hold the security interest perfected are inapplicable to a case such as the present one. Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 544(a), the trustee’s avoiding powers are without regard to any knowledge of the trustee or any creditor. See In re Sportswear Shoppe Ltd., 15 B.R. 970, 975 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Mo.1981). This does not mean the name appearing on the financing statement must be absolutely perfect. “The trustee in bankruptcy is considered to be in the position of a hypothetical but prudent creditor.” Matter of Glasco, Inc., 642 F.2d 793, 796 (5th Cir.1981). The trustee cannot be charged with actual knowledge but should be taken to stand in the shoes of an ideal creditor who had no notice of the trade name used herein. An error that is seriously misleading is sufficient to allow the trustee to avoid the security interest. See In re Amsco Inc., 26 B.R. 358, 363 (Bkrtcy.D.Conn.1982). The court holds, therefore, that the security interest alleged by L.B. Smith, Inc. in the subject equipment was not perfected due to an error in the UCC-1 Financing Statement filed with the Secretary of State of the State of New Jersey on or about March 17, 1980. Accordingly, the trustee may avoid this alleged security interest in the subject equipment. The counterclaim of L.B. Smith, Inc. seeking a judgment that it has a valid, perfected and enforceable security interest in and to the subject equipment superior to and prior to the Trustee is denied.
