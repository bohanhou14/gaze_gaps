The Kedzioras claim that Citicorp's regular use of an actuarial method, rather than the Rule of 78s, to calculate early termination charges in cases of default is reasonable under section 1667b(b) of the Act. This argument is foreclosed by Orthmann and Early (977 F.2d 369) and Highsmith v. Chrysler Credit Corp., 18 F.3d 434. The Highsmith case specifically holds that failing to disclose any portion of the formula that a lessor actually uses for calculating the early termination charge will give rise to a technical violation of the disclosure provision found in 15 U.S.C. § 1667a(ll) and Regulation M.

In this case, Citicorp concedes that it uses an undisclosed actuarial method to calculate early termination charges in cases of default, rather than the disclosed Rule of 78s. This constitutes a technical violation of the disclosure provisions in Section 1667a(ll). The Kedzioras' claim is therefore meritorious.

The Court grants Citicorp's motion for summary judgment on the Kedzioras' Second Amended Complaint and on Citicorp's Counterclaim, as to liability only. However, this judgment must be stayed pending the Kedzioras' opportunity to file a Third Amended Complaint, which raises the disclosure claim asserted in the motion to reconsider. The amendment shall be limited to the Section 1667a(ll) claim.

The Court also amends the certified class definition to include only those persons who terminated their leases after May 6, 1990, but before the scheduled termination of their leases, as the result of default, rather than a voluntary choice. Those persons who voluntarily terminated their leases and who wish to pursue an action against Citicorp may bring a separate lawsuit with adequate class representatives. The Kedzioras cannot now maintain a class action on their behalf.

gold_text: Apparently, the Kedzioras believe that this Court is able to review the dismissal of a colleague’s order dismissing a claim in the same way the Court of Appeals reviewed the plaintiffs’ disclosure claims in Highsmith. The Kedzioras are mistaken. This case is before this Court in a wholly different posture. We are not directly reviewing Judge Shadur’s dismissal of the original complaint, although that order is eoncededly interlocutory, rather than a final judgment under Rule 54(b). Rather, we have been presented with a motion to reconsider rulings which did not address the Kedzioras’ new disclosure claims. Although the distinction may be academic, this Court does not believe that reconsideration of issues never presented nor ruled upon is proper under Rule 60(b) — or 59(e) for that matter. A motion to amend the Second Amended Complaint under Rule 15(a) is a better way to raise the new theory, and the Court of Appeals in this Circuit tends to allow amendments, even for new factual allegations raised for the first time on appeal, provided they are consistent with the complaint. Highsmith, 18 F.3d 434, 439 (citing Hrubec v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 981 F.2d 962, 963-64 (7th Cir.1992), and Dawson v. General Motors Corp., 977 F.2d 369, 372 (7th Cir.1992)). Although it appears that Judge Shadur denied a similar request by the Kedzioras when the Second Amended Complaint was filed, this Court believes that the claim asserted is so clearly cognizable under Highsmith, that it would be unjust to deny amendment, even at this late date.
