As discussed in the preceding sections concerning the breach of the timber contracts, my analysis brings us to the Claims Court's findings on what damages were recoverable by Scott, including the scope and nature of liability. The court evaluated both the issue of liability and the issue of quantum by following procedures akin to those described in 451 F.2d 602. It separated the issues, initially focusing on liability and only minimally addressing quantum—sufficiently to avoid rendering liability purely academic (451 F.2d 602). Unfortunately, the plaintiff here was led to present minimal evidence on quantum, thereby receiving a deficient decision on the quantum issue much like the scenario in 451 F.2d 602.

Drawing on the principles established in those precedents, the Claims Court's approach on determining the suspension period and the corresponding damages becomes highly relevant. However, the court noted the government's prolonged suspension periods and inadequate notification practices, violating fair dealing as seen in my analysis. 

Concluding that the government's suspension and subsequent actions were misaligned with contractual fair dealing obligations, we hereby reverse the Claims Court's judgment. The Forest Service's continuation of suspensions—without specific court orders—falls outside authorized parameters as delineated in 451 F.2d 602.

For these reasons, we reverse the Claims Court's determinations on liability and damages, finding that the continued contract suspensions were not justified under the prevailing legal standards elucidated in 451 F.2d 602.

gold_text: We need not reach the issue of whether the Forest Service had the authority to continue the suspensions, because, as described in detail below, Scott has failed to establish that it suffered any damages. See Cosmo Constr. Co. v. United States, 451 F.2d 602, 605-06 (Ct.Cl.1971) (“[Tjhere must be some evidence of damage ... sufficient to demonstrate that the issue of liability is not purely academic; that some damage has been incurred.”); Puritan As-socs. v. United States, 566 F.2d 1191 (Ct. C1.1977) (Table) (“Even if ... the assessment of damages is reserved for the quantum phase of the case, the plaintiff as part of its proof of entitlement, must show it was damaged to some extent, by defendant’s derelictions.... ”).
