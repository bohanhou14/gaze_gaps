The legal case of Walter E. Rolling involves a complex procedural history, involving multiple appeals and resentencing by the Nebraska Supreme Court. Rolling argues that the increased sentence imposed after his unsuccessful appeal violated his due process rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause. He claims that the sentence increase was unpredictable and unforeseeable, citing Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964), and that the Nebraska Supreme Court's interpretation of the plain error doctrine was retroactive and violated his due process rights.

However, the court concludes that Rolling's claims fail. The court holds that the sentence increase was not unforeseeable, as the Nebraska Supreme Court had previously interpreted the habitual criminal statute to require a minimum sentence of ten years for each felony conviction. The court also notes that the plain error doctrine was not a new concept, as evidenced by cases such as State v. Gaston, 191 Neb. 121, 214 N.W.2d 376 (1974), which allowed for the correction of illegal sentences.

The court also rejects Rolling's arguments under the Double Jeopardy Clause, citing United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980), which held that a government appeal of an imposed sentence does not violate the double jeopardy clause. The court notes that the resentencing of Rolling was not a new trial, but rather a correction of an illegal sentence, and that the increased sentence did not violate his due process rights.

In conclusion, the court denies Rolling's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, as his claims under the Double Jeopardy Clause and Bouie v. City of Columbia fail. The court holds that the sentence increase was not unforeseeable and that the Nebraska Supreme Court's interpretation of the plain error doctrine was not retroactive. (799 F.2d 520, 722 F.2d 632)
