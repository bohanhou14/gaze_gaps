The case of Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Bankruptcy Court of the District of Delaware, No. 93-3028, is concerned with the issue of whether a district court has jurisdiction to grant a stay pending appeal of a bankruptcy court's order. The bankruptcy court had ordered the immediate disbursement of $8.36 million to Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA) from the registry of the bankruptcy court. The Government appealed this order and the district court granted a stay pending appeal, ruling that the bankruptcy court's order was a money judgment and not a mandatory injunction.

In Switzerland Cheese Assn., Inc. v. E. Horne's Market, Inc., 385 U.S. 23 (1966), the Supreme Court held that a district court has jurisdiction to grant a stay pending appeal of a bankruptcy court's order. However, in this case, the district court's order granting the stay was not appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) because it did not modify or dissolve an injunction. Additionally, the court lacked jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d) because the district court's order was not a final order.

The court also distinguished this case from other cases where it has relaxed the finality requirement in bankruptcy appeals. In this case, the district court's ruling ensured continuation of the controversy, i.e., preserving the issue of whether the Government is entitled to set off the $8.36 million now in the registry account against the claims of the Government agencies.

Therefore, the court dismissed TWA's appeal and held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to grant a stay pending appeal of the bankruptcy court's order. The court noted that the setoff issue would continue to be pending before the district court and that jurisdiction might vest in this court once the issue is finally resolved. The court concluded that it could see no "special circumstances which bring it outside the general rule and so limit its precedential value as to not measurably weaken our continued aversion to piecemeal appeals."
