**Generation:**



In reviewing the cases, I find that the ambiguous figure of 387,091 patients in Reference Case 7 F.3d 270 does not include all patients with incomes "less than $12,501." Instead, it only includes those with incomes between $3300 and $12,501. This reduces the indigency rate to 58% (57,750 patients / 99,000 patients).

Similarly, in Reference Case 857 F.2d 4, the court rejected certification of a factually undeveloped issue. The court noted that the case did not make an account of all the facts relevant to the question, and the nature of the controversy giving rise to the question was not clearly shown.

In the current case, the district court's factual findings are supported by the evidence. The court's finding that protected distributorship rights do not exist is not clearly erroneous. The court's choice between competing inferences, based on conflicting facts and shades of meaning, is also not clearly erroneous.

Furthermore, the court's entry of judgment in favor of Aljoma is also supported by the evidence. The court found as a fact that Aljoma had no awareness of any protected distributorship rights held by Mil, and thus was not liable for tortious interference. This finding is not clearly erroneous.

In conclusion, I agree with the district court's factual findings and the entry of judgment in favor of Aljoma. The court's findings are supported by the evidence, and are not clearly erroneous.

gold_text: There is one remaining loose end. MII requests for the first time on appeal that we certify a question as to the meaning and scope of Law 75 to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. We deny that request. MII chose a federal forum and eschewed any request to the district court for certification. Even in far more auspicious circumstances, we have not been receptive to requests for certification newly asserted on appeal, see, e.g., Nieves v. Univ. of P.R., 7 F.3d 270, 278 (1st Cir.1993), and here, the district courtâ€™s supportable factual finding that no protected distributorship rights existed undermines the argument that some unsettled issue of Puerto Rico law might be controlling. Under these inauspicious circumstances, we once again refuse a belated request for certification. See, e.g., id.; Fischer v. Bar Harbor Banking & Trust Co., 857 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir.1988).
