Under the standards set forth by the Supreme Court in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992), to establish standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) an injury in fact; (2) a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of; and (3) likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Here, CBAA has failed to demonstrate an injury-in-fact as required. As indicated in reference case 434 F.3d 584, an organization must show concrete and demonstrable injury to its activities beyond an abstract social interest.

Furthermore, for associational standing, an organization must demonstrate that its members have standing to sue in their own right (290 F.3d 430). CBAA has not identified any members harmed by the VA's actions who would satisfy the requirements for standing. Reference case 278 F.3d 21 clarifies that the organization must submit evidence that its members face direct harm, which CBAA fails to achieve. Therefore, CBAA lacks both direct and associational standing.

In summary, CBAA does not fulfill the criteria for standing on its own behalf or on behalf of its members, as established in the precedent cases (434 F.3d 584, 278 F.3d 21, 290 F.3d 430). Consequently, the Court grants VA's motion to dismiss for lack of standing.

Norton, 434 F.3d 584, 590 (D.C.Cir.2006) (“In order to establish standing, [the association] must demonstrate, as to each of its claims, that at least one member meets the requirements of Lujan.”). To determine whether an individual is a member of an organization, the Court looks to whether that individual possesses the “indicia” of membership, which include electing the leadership of the association, guiding the association’s activities, and financing those activities. See Am. Legal Found., 808 F.2d at 91 (holding that “media watchdog” organization that purported to act on behalf of television viewers lacked associational standing because the viewers did not select leadership, guide activities, or finance activities); see also Fund Democracy, LLC v. SEC, 278 F.3d 21, 26-27 (D.C.Cir.2002) (holding that plaintiff organization that purported to act on behalf of an “informal consortium” of mutual fund investors lacked associational standing because it was not steered by its purported members and did not receive funding from such members); Gettman v. DEA, 290 F.3d 430, 435 (D.C.Cir.2002) (holding that magazine that purported to act on behalf of readers and subscribers lacked associational standing because those readers and subscribers did not select leadership, guide activities, or finance activities).
