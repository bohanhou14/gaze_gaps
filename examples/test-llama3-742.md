The issue of whether a state court judgment may have preclusive effect on a federal antitrust claim that could not have been raised in the state proceeding is addressed in Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373 (1985). The Court held that federal antitrust claims are not barred by a state court judgment that did not address those claims.

In the instant case, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted with respect to the plaintiffs' claims for civil penalties, and denied in all other respects. The court finds that the plaintiffs' claims for civil penalties are barred by the one-year statute of limitations, as the alleged misrepresentations were discovered by the plaintiffs in January 1994.

The court also finds that Alexander's claim for actual damages is not barred by the statute of limitations, as the discovery rule applies to fraud-based statutory claims. The court holds that Alexander's cause of action accrued when Alexander discovered, or reasonably should have discovered, the alleged misrepresentations.

Finally, the court denies CMB's motion for collateral estoppel, as the arbitration award was vacated and the claims for actual damages were not precluded on the merits.

In conclusion, the court grants CMB's motion for summary judgment with respect to the plaintiffs' claims for civil penalties, and denies the motion in all other respects.
