We now turn to Wardrick's remaining claims regarding his 1984 conviction for escape and his 1988 convictions for common-law battery and resisting arrest.

First, Wardrick's 1984 conviction for escape falls within the scope of a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). As outlined in the reference case 983 F.2d 1306, the crime of escape or assisting in the escape of a federal prisoner constitutes a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16(b) due to the substantial risk of physical force inherent in such acts. Similarly, attempting to escape custody or evade lawful detainment involves a significant risk of physical confrontation with officials or others, thus categorizing it as a violent felony under § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).

Moreover, in reference case 71 F.3d 115, convictions for assault with a deadly weapon and escape while serving a felony sentence were upheld as predicate violent felonies under the ACCA. Here too, Wardrick's escape conviction constitutes a violent felony as it demonstrates conduct presenting a serious potential risk of physical injury to others.

Regarding the 1988 convictions for common-law battery and resisting arrest, these too are violent felonies under ACCA, as seen in 71 F.3d 115, where similar convictions were deemed violent due to the inherent physical confrontations involved. Battery involves intentional harmful or offensive contact, while resisting arrest by its nature involves violent interactions with law enforcement officers.

In summary, the district court correctly identified at least four of Wardrick’s prior convictions as violent felonies under ACCA. Therefore, there was no error in sentencing Wardrick as an armed career criminal.

gold_text: The district court also properly characterized Wardrick’s 1984 Maryland conviction for escape as a violent felony. As we have indicated, felony escape and attempted escape constitute violent felonies under ACCA- — even if accomplished by stealth. See generally United States v. Hairston, 71 F.3d 115 (4th Cir.1995) (holding felony escape in North Carolina to be crime of violence under ACCA because escape presents risk of injury to others); United States v. Aragon, 983 F.2d 1306, 1313 (4th Cir.1993) (holding attempt to rescue prisoner and assisting in escape to be crimes of violence because of inherent risk of force).
