Regarding the motion to dismiss, it is essential to consider the relationship between the parties and the jurisdiction of the court. In the case of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), the Supreme Court established the principle that federal courts must apply the substantive law of the forum state. In this case, the forum state is Ohio, and the applicable law is the law of Ohio.

In the case of Fyffe v. Jeno’s, Inc., 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108 (1991), the Ohio Supreme Court established the requirements for establishing an intentional tort claim against an employer. The plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant had knowledge of the existence of a dangerous condition, process, procedure, or instrumentality, knew with substantial certainty that the employee was likely to suffer harm, and required the employee to perform the job despite this knowledge.

In the case of Marbley v. Crisp, et al., 167 F.3d 309 (6th Cir. 1998), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals considered a similar issue of jurisdiction and dismissed the case due to lack of personal jurisdiction. The court held that the defendant did not purposefully avail himself of the privilege of acting in Ohio or cause a consequence to a resident of Ohio, and that the alleged joint venture between the defendants was insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction.

In this case, the plaintiff argues that the defendant Leak is liable for the alleged breach of the employment agreement. However, the plaintiff has not alleged any specific facts that would establish an intentional tort claim against Leak under the requirements of Fyffe v. Jeno’s, Inc. Additionally, the court lacks personal jurisdiction over Leak due to the lack of purposeful availment and the insufficient alleged joint venture.

Therefore, the motion to dismiss is GRANTED. The court lacks personal jurisdiction over Leak, and the plaintiff has failed to state a claim against him under the applicable law of Ohio.

gold_text: When its jurisdiction is based upon diversity, as is the case here, the Court is in effect a court of the forum state and must apply the substantive law of Ohio. Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); Jandro v. Ohio Edison Co., 167 F.3d 309, 313 (6th Cir.1999). A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) therefore requires application of Ohio substantive law to determine whether the plaintiffs complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiff here seeks damages for “intentional infliction of emotional distress” and “public policy tort,” arising out of conduct alleged to have been committed by Leak and PCCI. The Complaint does not state sufficient facts upon which relief can be granted on these claims, and Counts V and VI must therefore be dismissed.
