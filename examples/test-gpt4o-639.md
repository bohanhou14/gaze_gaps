**Generation:**

Such a broad and generalized request for declaratory relief falls squarely within the prohibition against advisory opinions as outlined in 392 U.S. 83. Federal courts are precluded from issuing advisory opinions that do not resolve an immediate dispute but rather provide general guidance. This principle is further underscored by the need to maintain a clear separation of powers, ensuring that courts address only those disputes capable of resolution through the judicial process.

Additionally, the request contravenes the principles of federal-state relationship and the proper functioning of administrative processes as discussed in 344 U.S. 237. The courts have long held that administrative bodies possess the initial responsibility to interpret and enforce their respective regulatory statutes. Any judicial attempt to preemptively interpret regulatory statutes disrupts this administrative order.

Moreover, the precedent set in 438 U.S. 726 further elucidates that agencies, like the FCC, rightfully refrain from issuing declaratory orders on hypothetical scenarios absent a clear factual context. The Coalition's request lacks the concreteness required for judicial determination and thus cannot compel the FCC or the court to issue a declaratory ruling.

In summary, the Coalition’s petition does not present a justiciable controversy and thus requires dismissal as it seeks an impermissible advisory opinion.

gold_text: Thus, even if the FCC had issued a general declaratory order as the Coalition requested, any review by this court would amount to an advisory opinion prohibited under Article III of the Constitution. See Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 96, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1950, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). While the FCC might properly issue such a general declaration which does not settle an actual controversy between adverse parties, this court cannot. See Public Service Comm’n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 242-43, 73 S.Ct. 236, 239-40, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952). As the Supreme Court has explained, “This Court ... reviews judgments, not statements in opinions.... However appropriate it may be for an administrative agency to write broadly in an adjudicatory proceeding, federal courts have never been empowered to issue advisory opinions.” FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726, 734-35, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 3032-33, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978) (citations omitted).
