The issue at hand is whether the National Park Service (NPS) regulation prohibiting trapping in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore and Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is valid. The regulation is based on the Organic Act of 1916 and its amendments, which aimed to conserve the scenery and natural objects within the national park system.

The court must determine whether the regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the congressional acts and whether it is consistent with the policy intended by Congress. In Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694), the court held that when a statute is silent or ambiguous, the agency's interpretation is entitled to deference.

In this case, the Organic Act and its amendments do not explicitly mention trapping, but they do authorize hunting and fishing in certain park areas. The enabling acts for Sleeping Bear and Pictured Rocks do not mention trapping either. However, the NPS regulation prohibits trapping in these areas, citing the Organic Act and its amendments.

The court finds that the NPS regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the congressional acts and is consistent with the policy intended by Congress. The regulation is based on the statutory language and the legislative history, which indicates that Congress intended to conserve the scenery and natural objects within the national park system.

In conclusion, the NPS regulation prohibiting trapping in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore and Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is valid and reasonable interpretation of the congressional acts. The regulation is consistent with the policy intended by Congress and is based on the statutory language and the legislative history.

gold_text: Plaintiffs claim that the latter consideration amounts to reversible error. However, while post-enactment developments cannot be accorded the weight of contemporary legislative history, and Congress’ failure to disapprove a regulation is not dispositive of congressional intent, the district court would be remiss if it ignored evidence that implies congressional intent.

Where “an agency’s statutory construction has been ‘fully brought to the attention of the public and Congress,’ and the latter has not sought to alter that interpretation although it has amended the statute in other respects, then presumably the legislative intent has been correctly discerned.” United States v. Rutherford, 442 U.S. 544, 554, n. 10, 99 S.Ct. 2470, 2476, n. 10, 61 L.Ed.2d 68 (1979) (quoting Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 487-89, 60 S.Ct. 982, 988-89, 84 L.Ed. 1311 (1940)).
