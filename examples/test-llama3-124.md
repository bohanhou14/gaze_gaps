To determine whether Ms. Lopez is entitled to qualified immunity, we must consider whether the law was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. In this case, the alleged violation is Ms. Lopez's failure to accommodate Mr. Ragsdell's disability.

The Supreme Court has held that a constitutional right to accommodation for disabled employees has not been recognized. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 367-68, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001). Furthermore, our court has rejected an equal protection claim by a disabled job applicant, reasoning that "nothing in the United States Constitution requires the City to accommodate [the disabled applicant's] condition." Welsh v. Tulsa, 977 F.2d 1415, 1420 (10th Cir.1992).

In DeVargas v. Mason & Hanger-Silas Mason Co., 844 F.2d 714, 725 (10th Cir.1988), we held that a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity on a claim based on disqualification of one-eyed individuals as inspectors, reasoning that the right was not clearly established. Similarly, in Jantz v. Muci, 976 F.2d 623, 627 (10th Cir.1992), we held that a plaintiff must do more than simply allege the violation of a general legal precept, such as the rational-basis standard for equal protection. The plaintiff must also show that existing law would have alerted the defendant to the unlawfulness of his actions.

In this case, Mr. Ragsdell's allegations against Ms. Lopez do not create a clearly established right. The Equal Protection Clause forbids any classification lacking a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental objective, but this prohibition does not create a constitutional right to accommodation for disabled employees. Therefore, Ms. Lopez is entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law.

In conclusion, Ms. Lopez is entitled to qualified immunity because the law was not clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. The alleged violation is Ms. Lopez's failure to accommodate Mr. Ragsdell's disability, which is not a clearly established constitutional right. The Supreme Court has held that a constitutional right to accommodation for disabled employees has not been recognized, and our court has rejected an equal protection claim by a disabled job applicant.

gold_text: Against the existing legal backdrop, Ms. Lopez would have had little reason to expect a court to regard denial of accommodation to Mr. Ragsdell as unconstitutional under the rational-basis standard. See DeVargas v. Mason & Hanger-Silas Mason Co., 844 F.2d 714, 725 (10th Cir.1988) (holding that a prospective employer was entitled to qualified immunity in part because of the absence of any decision that a regulatory classification based on a disability (vision in only one eye) lacked a rational basis); see also Jantz v. Muci, 976 F.2d 623, 630 (10th Cir.1992).
