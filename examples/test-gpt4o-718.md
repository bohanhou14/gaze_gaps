Raymond and Mary Frances Messman argue that the Commissioner’s position lacked substantial justification, referencing the Commissioner’s eventual concession. However, simply conceding an issue does not imply the initial stance was baseless. This was highlighted in the reference case 640 F.2d 1296, affirming that a concession does not automatically negate substantial justification if the initial position is supported by a reasonable basis in both law and fact.

Section 482 enables adjustments in transactions among controlled entities to prevent tax evasion and ensure accurate income reflection (640 F.2d 1296). As established in 640 F.2d 1296, the necessity of allocations must be justified based on the situation itself, not on perceived outcomes alone. The absence of interest payments on loans among the Messmans' controlled entities prompted the Commissioner to invoke § 482, arguing a need for adjustment to reflect an arm's length arrangement per Treas. Reg. § 1.482-2(a)(1).

Despite the later settlement, the initial reliance on § 482 was not unfounded given the specific transactional evidence. Consequently, the Tax Court’s decision to consider the Commissioner’s stance as substantially justified aligns with precedents set in cases like 640 F.2d 1296. Evaluating the overall facts and regulatory guidelines, the Tax Court's ruling against awarding litigation costs stands firm. Therefore, we uphold the Tax Court’s decision.

The Messmans argue that I.R.C. § 482 is not applicable .because the funds that Marco Oil provided to RAM Drilling and TMC Farms were capital contributions, not loans. The Messmans assert that, even though the financial arrangements between Marco Oil and RAM Drilling and TMC Farms were labeled loans, it is the substance of the transactions, not the terminology used to describe them, that matters: We agree that, although the denomination given the transactions is relevant, it is not determinative. Post Corp. v. United States, 226 Ct.Cl. 343, 640 F.2d 1296, 1304 (1981). The problem with the Messmans’ argument is that in this case, leaving aside the terminology used, all the other aspects of the initial transactions between Marco Oil and RAM Drilling and TMC Farms indicate the transactions were loans. After all, payment agreements were executed; there is no evidence that the funds were intended as equity investments in RAM Drilling and TMC Farms; an interest rate was originally set at 14%; and the payments made by the companies were recorded in loan repayment schedules.
