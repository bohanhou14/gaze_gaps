The case involves Jerry Langella, who was subpoenaed to appear before a New York grand jury investigating a murder. Langella claimed that the grand jury's questions were derived from illegal electronic surveillance, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2515. He argued that his conviction for criminal contempt, which stemmed from his refusal to answer certain questions, was improper.

The court held that Langella's guilty plea did not foreclose his pursuit of his claims in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, citing Lefkowitz v. Newsome, 420 U.S. 283 (1975). The court also noted that Langella's claims were not presented to the New York courts, and therefore, the federal court had jurisdiction to hear them.

The court further held that the grand jury's questions were not derived from illegal electronic surveillance, citing People v. Einhorn, 35 N.Y.2d 948 (1974). Langella's claims were based on his assumption that the grand jury's questions were derived from illegal surveillance, but the court found that he failed to make a timely request for further determination as to the source of the questions.

In conclusion, the court affirmed Langella's conviction, citing 411 U.S. 258 (1973) and 417 U.S. 21 (1974). The court held that Langella's guilty plea did not foreclose his pursuit of his claims, and that the grand jury's questions were not derived from illegal electronic surveillance.

gold_text: . Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 266, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973), holds that a guilty plea precludes a federal habeas corpus claim that the composition of the indicting grand jury violated the fourteenth amendment. Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 30, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 2104, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974), explains that in Toilett the tainted indictment “could have been ‘cured’ through a new indictment by a properly selected grand jury." Here Langella argues that there must be both a new grand jury and redaction of his truthful immunized answers.
