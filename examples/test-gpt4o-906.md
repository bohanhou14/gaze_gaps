The Motion to Transfer Venue

Defendants argue that, even if venue is proper in the Southern District of California, the case should be transferred to the Central District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), which allows for transfer “[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.” The court's discretion to grant such a motion is well-established (864 F.2d 635; 805 F.2d 834).

The factors to be considered in a § 1404(a) motion include the convenience of parties, the convenience of witnesses, and the interest of justice (611 F.2d 270). Here, all Plaintiffs and seven of the corporate entity defendants reside in the Central District of California (Samek Decl. ¶ 6-7; Carlyle Decl. ¶ 1). The interests of justice also favor transfer, as many witnesses and relevant documents are located within that district, minimizing the burden and costs associated with litigation (864 F.2d 635). Indeed, duplicative litigation can be avoided by consolidating the cases in a single forum, which is a significant factor supporting the transfer (Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Savage, 611 F.2d 270).

Moreover, the Defendants' lack of significant business transactions within the Southern District further justifies the transfer (805 F.2d 834). The court must balance the Plaintiffs' choice of forum against the inconveniences posed to the Defendants and witnesses. Given that the majority of the related activities and entities are based in the Central District of California, transferring the case serves both convenience and judicial efficiency (864 F.2d 635).

Accordingly, the motion to transfer venue to the Central District of California is granted. The Clerk of Court is instructed to transfer this action accordingly.

For these reasons, other pending motions are denied as moot.

gold_text: Defendants move to transfer this action to the Central District of California. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), the court may transfer an action to any other district or division where it might have been brought “[fjor the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice.” Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 820 F.Supp. 503, 506 (C.D.Cal.1992). A convenience transfer under § 1404(a) requires the court to assess a variety of factors and “involves subtle considerations and is best left to the discretion of the trial judge.” Sparling v. Hoffman Construction, 864 F.2d 635,, 639 (9th Cir.1988). The court may consider the convenience of the parties and witnesses, and the promotion of judicial efficiency and economy in determining whether to transfer an action. Id. Private factors to be considered include the location where the operative events occurred, the convenience of the parties and non-party witnesses, the location of relevant evidence, the availability of compulsory process, and other practical considerations for the efficient and cost-effective resolution of claims. Decker Coal Co. v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 805 F.2d 834, 843 (9th Cir.1986). Courts also look to the so-called public factors such as relative docket congestion, the local public and jury pool’s interest in the controversy, and issues relative to judicial economy. Id. at 508-09. Defendants have the burden of demonstrating that transfer is appropriate. See Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Savage, 611 F.2d 270, 279 (9th Cir.1979).
