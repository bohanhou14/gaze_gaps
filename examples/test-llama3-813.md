The issue at hand is whether the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the authority to terminate disability benefits without a Section 301 determination for individuals participating in vocational rehabilitation programs. The district court held that the Secretary's regulation, which limits Section 301 determinations to individuals who were not expected to recover medically before completing their rehabilitation program, is invalid.

The court's decision is consistent with the precedent set in cases such as 742 F.2d 729 and 725 F.2d 1489, which hold that the Secretary's regulation is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute. The statute requires that disability payments not be terminated or suspended if an individual is participating in a vocational rehabilitation program and the Commissioner determines that the program will increase the likelihood of the individual being permanently removed from the disability benefit rolls.

The court's decision is also supported by the legislative history, which suggests that Congress intended to provide a safety net for individuals who are participating in vocational rehabilitation programs. The court's holding is consistent with the principle of statutory construction, which requires that the court give effect to the plain meaning of the statute.

In conclusion, the district court's decision is correct and the Secretary's appeal is denied. The Secretary's regulation is invalid and disability benefits will not be terminated without a Section 301 determination for individuals participating in vocational rehabilitation programs. The court's decision is consistent with the precedent set in cases such as 742 F.2d 729 and 725 F.2d 1489 and is supported by the legislative history and the principle of statutory construction.

gold_text: The Secretary argues that because the statute provides that there must be a “final decision” by the Secretary or a “final judgment” by a court that the person is “entitled” to benefits, see 42 U.S.C. § 405(i) (1982), sovereign immunity proscribes the district court’s order to reinstate benefits to the plaintiff class pending completion of their Section 301 determinations. The Secretary cites no authority applying sovereign immunity to restrict a court’s right to reinstate Social Security benefits improperly terminated. In fact three circuits have considered and rejected the Secretary’s “sovereign immunity” assertion. The Second Circuit explained, “the payment of benefits to wrongfully terminated recipients follows a final decision of the Secretary and consequently is consistent with the requirements of Section 405(i).” City of New York v. Heckler, 742 F.2d 729, 740 (2d Cir.1984), opinion on petition for rehearing, 755 F.2d 31 (2d Cir.1985), petition for cert. filed, — U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 3552, 87 L.Ed.2d 671 (1985) (citing Lopez v. Heckler, 725 F.2d 1489, 1508-09 (9th Cir.), vacated and remanded on other grounds, — U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 583, 83 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) and Mental Health Association v. Heckler, 720 F.2d at 972 n. 18 (8th Cir.1983)). Since we find this argument persuasive and dispositive we need not in this case rely on any more general waiver of sovereign immunity in the Social Security Act or on our inherent equitable powers.
