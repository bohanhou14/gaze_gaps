The cases at hand involve a complex web of conspiracy allegations, procedural due process claims, and equal protection concerns. Plaintiff Ronald Pokrandt, acting pro se, brings these claims against various defendants, including judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officials.

The court must first consider the jurisdictional predicate of state action, which is lacking in many instances. In Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 325 (1981), the Supreme Court held that a public defender does not act under color of state law when performing a lawyer's traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.

Regarding the claim against defendant Blair P. Warner, Assistant Public Defender of Schuylkill County, the court notes that public defenders acting within the scope of their professional duties are absolutely immune from civil liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Black v. Bayer, 672 F.2d 309, 320 (3d Cir. 1982).

In Count I, plaintiff alleges that defendant Corporal Richard K. Freed, a Pennsylvania State Trooper, conspired with District Justice Matz to deny plaintiff the right to defend himself. However, plaintiff does not have an absolute right to defend himself in any manner he chooses, as federal and state laws place limitations on the manner in which an attorney defends his client. See, e.g., Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; Federal Rules of Evidence; Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure.

In Count III, plaintiff alleges that defendant Freed conspired with defendant District Justice Matz to deny plaintiff due process. However, plaintiff does not have a constitutionally protected right to have one state district justice approve the summons for an arrest warrant and another state district justice preside at the preliminary hearing. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Allem, 367 Pa.Super. 173, 532 A.2d 845, 851-52 (1987).

The court concludes that many of these claims must be dismissed, as plaintiff lacks standing, fails to allege the requisite state action, or has no federal or state protected right entitling him to due process or equal protection of the law. The claims against defendant Warner, Freed, and other defendants shall be dismissed with prejudice. The court will not address the remaining claims, as they are either redundant or fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

gold_text: In Counts III and VI, plaintiff alleges that his right to equal protection of the laws was violated when District Justice Matz presided over plaintiff’s preliminary hearing and when District Attorney Shields disapproved plaintiff’s private criminal complaints. The equal protection clause protects against the arbitrary classification of an individual or group of individuals by the government and provides that the government treat similarly situated individuals in a similar manner. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 2394, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982); In re Asbestos Litigation, 829 F.2d 1233, 1238 (3d Cir. 1987). Therefore, plaintiff’s equal protection claims against defendant Freed must fail because plaintiff does not allege that defendant Freed treated him differently from other similarly situated individuals, i.e. other individuals arrested for driving under the influence. In addition, as already stated, plaintiff has no right (1) to have a district justice different from the one who approved his arrest warrant preside over his preliminary hearing and (2) to have the district attorney approve his private criminal complaints.
