In the context of the legal cases, the application of due process is crucial in ensuring fairness and reliability in the identification process. The cases of Stovall v. Denno (388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199, 1967) and Wade v. United States (388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, 1967) highlight the importance of balancing the competing interests between the prosecution and the defendant. The courts have consistently held that a showup close in time and place to the crime does not necessarily impinge on due process, provided that the identification is not impermissibly suggestive (Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199, 1967).

In the case at bar, the identification by witness Haynes and Officer Smith was conducted in a fair and reliable manner. Haynes identified Andriacci as the man who turned and looked at him at the scene of the crime, and Officer Smith positively identified the three appellants as the men he saw escape at the roadblock. The showup occurred less than an hour and a half after their initial encounter, and both witnesses had a clear and unobstructed view of the appellants.

The courts have also held that a four-man lineup is not inherently impermissibly suggestive, especially when the witness has not previously seen the suspects (Foster v. California, 394 U.S. 440, 442, 89 S.Ct. 1127, 22 L.Ed.2d 402, 1969). Furthermore, the presence of a plainclothes detective in the showup room does not necessarily make the procedure impermissibly suggestive (Spriggs v. United States, 383 F.2d 206, 1967).

In conclusion, the identification procedures in this case were fair and reliable, and the application of due process was not violated. The courts have consistently held that a showup close in time and place to the crime, conducted in a fair and reliable manner, does not necessarily impinge on due process (449 F.2d 1026, 408 F.2d 1280, 405 F.2d 110
