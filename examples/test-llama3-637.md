This case presents a challenge to the adequacy of an individualized education program (IEP) prepared by the Town of Stow, Massachusetts for a learning-disabled child, Christopher Amann. The IEP was developed by a team that included a representative of the local educational agency, Christopher's teacher and parents, and an impartial hearing officer. The IEP was reviewed annually and revised as necessary. The parents, Richard and Barbara Amann, rejected the proposed IEP and demanded a hearing on its adequacy and appropriateness.

In Torres v. Public Health Trust, 487 U.S. 312 (1988), the Supreme Court held that the specificity requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 3(c) is jurisdictional and must be met before a court can hear an appeal. Similarly, in Kotler v. American Tobacco Co., 934 F.2d 4 (1991), the court held that the specificity requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite.

In this case, the parents' motion to strike portions of the appendix and for sanctions is denied. The court finds that the Town of Stow has followed the required procedures in formulating the IEP and that the parents have been given a fair opportunity to be heard on their claim.

The court also finds that the IEP is substantively adequate because it is "reasonably calculated to enable Christopher to receive educational benefits." In Burlington v. Department of Education, 736 F.2d 773 (1984), the court held that the primary safeguard is the obligatory development of an individualized education program (IEP). The court also notes that the parents' claims of procedural violations are without merit.

In conclusion, the court affirms the judgment of the district court, finding that the IEP prepared by the Town of Stow is substantively and procedurally adequate. The court also denies the parents' motion to strike portions of the appendix and for sanctions.

gold_text: . The Amanns’ lawyer bowed out after filing the motion for reconsideration. In all subsequent administrative and judicial proceedings, Mr. Amann, acting “pro se,” represented himself, his wife and his son. We generally do not allow non-lawyers to represent litigants other than themselves, see Herrera-Venegas v. Sanchez-Rivera, 681 F.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir.1982), and the Second Circuit has applied this principle to prohibit a parent who was not a lawyer from representing his child. Cheung v. Youth Orchestra Foundation of Buffalo, Inc., 906 F.2d 59, 61 (2d Cir.1990). However, because we affirm on the merits, we need not determine whether Christopher and Barbara Amann’s appeals are properly before us. See Norton v. Mathews, 427 U.S. 524, 532, 96 S.Ct. 2771, 2775, 49 L.Ed.2d 672 (1976); Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 8 n. 5 (1st Cir.1991). Similarly, we need not decide whether the notice of appeal, which named only "Christopher Amann et al.” in its caption, but was signed by Mr. Amann, adequately identified Mr. Amann as an appellant. See Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312, 108 S.Ct. 2405, 101 L.Ed.2d 285 (1988); Santos-Martinez v. Soto-Santiago, 863 F.2d 174, 176 (1st Cir.1988) (court of appeals lacks power to hear appeal from party not specified in notice of appeal, and "et al.” does not sufficiently identify an appellant).
