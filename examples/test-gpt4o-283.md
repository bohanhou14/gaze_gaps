50. The court finds instructive the analysis in Wilson’s Customs Clearance, Inc. v. United States, 59 Cust. Ct. 36, C.D. 3061 (1967), where the court stressed the quality of amusement derived from an item as controlling in determining a toy classification. Here, the subject merchandise induces amusement in a manner similar to recognized toys, bolstering its classification as a toy under HTSUS subheading 9503.49.00 (78 Cust. Ct. 28).

51. The court further notes the relevance of the case Pima Western v. United States, 843 F. Supp. 1489, 1495 (1994), underscoring the clarity of the HTSUS when the provisions are unambiguous. In this case, as the HTSUS provisions regarding toys are clear, comparing the HTSUS with the TSUS is neither necessary nor enlightening for classification purposes (915 F. Supp. 399).

52. Therefore, based on the evidence and satisfactory interpretation of HTSUS, the subject merchandise is appropriately classified as "toys" under HTSUS subheading 9503.49.00. This decision aligns with the established legal precedents and statutory interpretation guidelines.

gold_text: This conclusion is also consistent with the definition and treatment of the term “toy” under the predecessor to the HTSUS, the Tariff Schedules of the United States (“TSUS”).See, e.g.,J.C. Penney Purchasing Corp. v. United States, 10 CIT 727, 728 (1986) (noting that schedule 7, part 5, subpart E, headnote 2 of the TSUS defined a “toy” as “any article chiefly used for the amusement of children or adults”); Ideal Toy Corp. v. United States, 78 Cust. Ct. 28, 33 (1977) (“When amusement and utility become locked in controversy, the question becomes one of determining whether the amusement is incidental to the utilitarian purpose, or the utility purpose incidental to the amusement.”); see also Pima Western, Inc. v. United States, 20 CIT 110, 116-17, 915 F. Supp. 399, 404-05 (1996) (“[0]n a case-by-case basis prior decisions should be considered instructive in interpreting the HTS, particularly where the nomenclature previously interpreted in those decisions remains unchanged and no dissimilar interpretation is required by the text of the HTS[US].” (quoting H. Conf. R. No. 576, at 549-50)).
