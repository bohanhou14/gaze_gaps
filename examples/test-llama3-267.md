 I'd be happy to help you with your question. However, I need to clarify that the cases you provided are court decisions, not legal articles or references. They are case laws that have been decided by courts. 

To answer your question, the courts have established certain requirements for a plan of reorganization to be confirmed under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. One of these requirements is that the plan must be proposed in good faith. In determining good faith, the court looks at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the plan's proposal.

In the case of Public Finance Corp. v. Freeman, 712 F.2d 219 (5th Cir. 1983), the court held that the phrase "proposed in good faith" must be viewed in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the plan's proposal. This analysis must be accomplished mindful of the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code and its legislative predecessors.

In the instant case, the debtor's plan of reorganization proposes to sell the subject property at a price higher than its own witnesses' opinion of the market value of the property. The plan also proposes to take two years to market the property, which may not be a reasonable time frame considering the risks involved.

In the case of Matter of Madison Hotel Associates, 749 F.2d 410 (7th Cir. 1984), the court stated that the important point of inquiry is the plan itself and whether such plan will fairly achieve a result consistent with the objectives and purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.

Based on the facts presented, it appears that the debtor's plan of reorganization may not be proposed in good faith. The plan proposes to sell the subject property at a price higher than its own witnesses' opinion of the market value of the property, and the plan also proposes to take two years to market the property, which may not be a reasonable time frame considering the risks involved.
