In determining whether the ALJ failed to develop the record adequately, it is instructive to examine analogous precedents. For instance, in Brockman’s case, the court held that the ALJ did not err in failing to investigate further when the claimant did not present sufficient evidence of mental impairment during the application process (987 F.2d 1344). The court emphasized that substantial evidence supported the ALJ’s decision due to the paucity of evidence presented by the claimant.

Conversely, in McGinty’s case, the district court found that the ALJ ignored vocational testimony and relied selectively on medical reports, leading to a remand for recalculation of benefits (713 F.2d 398). The importance of a thorough and balanced assessment by the ALJ was highlighted, a principle equally applicable to Battles’ case where the ALJ failed to investigate potential mental impairments.

Further, in Highfill’s situation, the duty of the ALJ to fully and fairly develop the record was reiterated, even when considering administrative procedural rules (832 F.2d 112). Given these precedents, Battles' limited education, significant life hardships, and potential mental impairments necessitated a more comprehensive examination by the ALJ.

Ultimately, the failure to fully explore these issues at the initial hearing stages warrants remand for further proceedings. We conclude that similar to the McGinty case, where failure to fill evidentiary "gaps" led to a remand, the same should apply in Battles' claim.

Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand this case with instructions to remand to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
