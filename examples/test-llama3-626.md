In the case of Caliendo v. California, the Supreme Court held that the California Court of Appeal's decision was contrary to clearly established federal law because it failed to presume prejudice in evaluating the impact of the conversation between Detective Mundell and the three jurors. The Court cited Mattox v. United States, 146 U.S. 140 (1892), which established the rebuttable presumption of prejudice in cases of juror misconduct.

In Mattox, the Court held that "possibly prejudicial" out-of-court communications between jurors and outside parties "invalidate the verdict, at least unless their harmlessness is made to appear." The Court also stated that the government must establish the harmlessness of such communications through clear and convincing evidence.

In Caliendo's case, the California Court of Appeal failed to apply the Mattox presumption, instead placing the burden on the defendant to prove prejudice. The Court of Appeal found that the improper conversation did not directly relate to the trial and that the jurors had not been influenced by the conversation.

However, the Supreme Court held that the California Court of Appeal's decision was contrary to clearly established federal law because it failed to presume prejudice. The Court cited Wheeler v. United States, 886 F.2d 268 (9th Cir. 1989), which held that the government must establish the harmlessness of juror misconduct through clear and convincing evidence.

In its analysis, the Supreme Court noted that the improper contact between Mundell and the jurors was possibly prejudicial because it lasted for 20 minutes and involved critical prosecution witness. The Court also noted that the case was close enough that Caliendo's first jury hung, and that the improper contact created the potential for prejudice.

Therefore, the Supreme Court held that the California Court of Appeal's decision was contrary to clearly established federal law because it failed to presume prejudice in evaluating the impact of the conversation between Detective Mundell and the three jurors. The Court's decision was consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Mattox v. United States, and with the Ninth Circuit's decision in Wheeler v. United States.

gold_text: While the state appellate court determined that no prejudice resulted from the incident, we may not simply defer to this finding. AEDPAâ€™s presumption of correctness does not apply to state court findings arrived at through the use of erroneous legal standards. See Fernandez v. Roe, 286 F.3d 1073, 1077 (9th Cir.2002); Wade v. Terhune, 202 F.3d 1190, 1197 (9th Cir.2000). The state appellate court employed an incorrect standard when it placed the burden of proof on the defendant instead of the government. We therefore review de novo the correct question of whether the government met its heavy burden of proof under Mattox and Remmer. See Thompson, 74 F.3d at 1573.
