Based on the given reference cases, it appears that the defendant, New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad, failed to take reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of the plaintiff, who was a track employee. The case revolves around the idea that the defendant knew of the dangers present in the tunnel, yet failed to take necessary measures to prevent the accident.

In reference case 269 F. 1, the court established that an employee may assume that his employer has exercised proper care with respect to his safety until notified to the contrary, unless the want of care and the danger arising from it are so obvious that an ordinarily careful person, under the circumstances, would observe and appreciate them.

In reference case 36 S. Ct. 564, the court ruled that the Federal Employers' Liability Act abolishes the defense of negligence of a fellow servant, except that the latter may be considered in fixing the damages. However, in this case, the defendant's negligence appears to be more egregious than that of a fellow servant, as it failed to take necessary precautions to prevent the accident.

Furthermore, reference case 60 L. Ed. 1016 suggests that circumstances may arise under which a railroad is required to take some precautions to protect workmen in its yards. In this case, the defendant was aware of the dangers present in the tunnel and failed to take necessary measures to prevent the accident.

In conclusion, the defendant's failure to take reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of the plaintiff constituted negligence, and the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for his injuries. The reference cases provide valuable guidance in evaluating the defendant's liability and the extent of the plaintiff's damages.

gold_text: In Smith v. Payne (C. C. A.) 269 F. 1, 3, the court said: “But in order to safeguard himself from the ordinary 'dangers of his employment, as the law requires him to do, a traek employee is not called upon to seek out and discover extraordinary dangers imposed on him by his employer, but may assume that his employer and his agents have exercised for his safety such care as the circumstances reasonably admit” — the court adding in Ches. & Ohio Ry. v. De Atley, 241 U. S. 310, 36 S. Ct. 564, 566, 60 L. Ed. 1016: “Unless the want of care and the danger arising from it are so obvious that an ordinarily careful person, under the circumstances, would observe and appreciate them.” “The federal Employers’ Liability Act places a coemployee’s negligence, when it is the ground of the action, in the same relation as that of the employer upon the matter of assumption of risk.” See Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Ward, 252 U. S. 18, 21, 22, 40 S. Ct. 275, 276, 64 L. Ed. 430.
