The reference cases 344 U.S. 33 and 334 U.S. 37 provide valuable insights into the legal framework surrounding administrative decisions and the role of courts in reviewing these decisions.

In the context of the case at hand, the Commission's order is subject to review by the courts. As the Supreme Court held in 344 U.S. 33, courts should not topple over administrative decisions unless the administrative body has erred and failed to follow its own procedures. In this case, the Commission's order is based on its findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the court's review is limited to determining whether these findings and conclusions are supported by the evidence and are in accordance with the law.

The Commission's order is also subject to the principles established in 334 U.S. 37, which hold that an administrative agency has the authority to bar discriminatory prices that tend to lessen or injure competition. In this case, the Commission's order is based on its finding that Swanee's payments to Leigh were made in consideration of services or facilities rendered by or through Grand Union, and that these payments were not available on proportionally equal terms to all other competing customers of Swanee.

In conclusion, the reference cases 344 U.S. 33 and 334 U.S. 37 provide a framework for reviewing the Commission's order in this case. The court's review is limited to determining whether the Commission's findings and conclusions are supported by the evidence and are in accordance with the law, and the Commission's order is subject to the principles established in these cases.

gold_text: It is true that Swanee did not object to the order during the proceedings below and that orderly appellate review of administrative decisions usually requires that such objections be made. See United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, 1952, 344 U.S. 33, 73 S.Ct. 67, 97 L.Ed. 54. Swanee did object to the order, however, in its petition to review, and at the time this was filed, the Commission could have modified its order if it had so wished. See 15 U.S.C.A. ยง 21(b). Moreover, the order as written is so broad that, under the new enforcement provisions of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.A. ยง 21), the duty of enforcing the prohibitions of Section 2(d) as to Swanee is shifted from the Commission to the federal courts, which may in the future be forced to decide the very issues that Congress has entrusted the Commission to determine. See F. T. C. v. Morton Salt Co., 1948, 334 U.S. 37, 68 S.Ct. 822, 92 L.Ed. 1196. Proper judicial administration requires that the order be modified, and we therefore hold that the order should be limited to the particular practice found to violate the statute.
