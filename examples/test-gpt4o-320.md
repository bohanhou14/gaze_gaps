Notably, Cuprum’s assertion that Dr. Vinson’s design was insufficiently peer-reviewed and not industry-accepted falls flat when considering the precedents set in related cases. For instance, in the context of expertise and the court's discretion to weigh testimony credibility, the case of Gicla highlights that even unchallenged expert testimony does not compel a favorable judgment if the court finds issues in the analysis (572 F.3d 407). Furthermore, as illustrated in the case involving Drs. Peckler and Abecassis, the jury's decision is paramount if it falls within a reasonable basis of evidence, even when alternative conclusions could be reached (519 F.3d 380). Similar deference to the jury’s verdict aligns with Illinois' standard, which ensures verdicts are respected provided they are reasonable based on the evidence, as epitomized in the verdict affirmation despite conflicting expert views in an Indiana law context (719 F.2d 233). Ultimately, the jury reasonably found in Baugh’s favor, and Cuprum’s appeals fail to demonstrate a fundamental flaw in the expert testimonies or the sufficiency of evidence provided.

gold_text: We reject the notion that no reasonable jury could have concluded the same: Dr. Vinson adequately explained why a ladder like Baugh’s could fail when used as instructed, how the legs and gussets could be modified to prevent such a failure, and why the finite element analysis on which Dr. Stevenson relied was an inferior method of calculating the varying levels of force users apply on ladders. So Cuprum was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the unreasonably dangerous condition element. See, e.g., Gicla v. United States, 572 F.3d 407, 414 (7th Cir. 2009) (observing that the case “presented a classic battle of the experts ... [that] called upon the factfinder to determine what weight and credibility to give to each expert”); Wipf v. Kowalski, 519 F.3d 380, 385 (7th Cir. 2008) (“[I]n a case of dueling experts ... it is left to the trier of fact, not the reviewing court, to decide how to weigh the competing expert testimony.”); Spesco, Inc. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 719 F.2d 233, 237-38 (7th Cir. 1983) (“[T]his case presents a typical example of opposing experts offering conflicting views to the jury.... It is within the province of the jury to determine which of two contradictory expert statements is deserving of credit.”),
