In the case at hand, the Railroad argues that the denial of Boynton's dismissal contravenes explicit and well-defined public policies against sexual harassment in the workplace. Citing the Ninth Circuit’s recognition of the public policy exception as outlined in Stead Motors, 886 F.2d at 1209 n.9, and the Supreme Court’s precedence in W.R. Grace and Co., 461 U.S. at 766, indicating the obligation not to enforce arbitral awards violating such policies, the Railroad asserts that Boynton’s reinstatement undermines an established public policy. Further supporting this argument is Newsday, Inc. v. Long Island Typographical Union, 915 F.2d 840, which reinforced that reinstating an individual dismissed for sexual harassment directly conflicts with a dominant public policy (915 F.2d at 844). The adherence to EEOC guidelines (29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(f)) emphasizes employers' responsibility to enact measures preventing sexual harassment and fostering a harassment-free workplace, as mentioned in Newsday and Misco (108 S.Ct. 373). Hence, the Railroad's position is that Fletcher's arbitral award should be vacated on these grounds to align with federal law and policies aimed at eliminating workplace harassment.

gold_text: Next, the Railroad contends that the United States has a clear, well-defined and dominant policy prohibiting sexual harassment in the work place, which includes an affirmative duty on the part of employers to counteract and eliminate sexual harassment. The Railroad refers to two recent cases where arbi tral awards were vacated because they ran afoul of the policy prohibiting sexual harassment. See Stroehmann Bakeries, Inc. v. Local 776, 969 F.2d 1436, 1441-2 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, — U.S.-, 113 S.Ct. 660, 121 L.Ed.2d 585 (1992); and Newsday, Inc. v. Long Island Typographical Union, 915 F.2d 840, 844-45 (2nd Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 922, 111 S.Ct. 1314, 113 L.Ed.2d 247 (1991).
