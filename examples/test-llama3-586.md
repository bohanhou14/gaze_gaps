In the context of the legal cases provided, we can analyze the issue of attorney's fees. In the case of Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, the Supreme Court established a two-step process for analyzing a deduction for "limited success." The first step is to consider whether the plaintiff failed to prevail on claims that were unrelated to the claims on which he succeeded. The second step is to consider whether the plaintiff achieved a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award.

In the case at hand, it is clear that the plaintiff, Watson, achieved a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award. Watson was awarded a preliminary injunction that prevented the use of his report at the administrative hearing, which is a significant achievement. Moreover, the district court's award of attorney's fees was not an abuse of discretion.

The district court's award of attorney's fees for time spent preparing unsuccessful claims is also justified. In the case of Odima v. INS, 239 F.3d 1140, the court held that hours expended on unrelated, unsuccessful claims should not be included in an award of fees. However, in this case, all of Watson's claims involved the same course of conduct and sought the same relief. Therefore, the hours spent preparing unsuccessful claims were not unrelated to the successful claim for the preliminary injunction.

In conclusion, the district court's award of attorney's fees was not an abuse of discretion. Watson achieved a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award, and the hours spent preparing unsuccessful claims were related to the successful claim for the preliminary injunction.

Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), the U.S. Supreme Court proscribed a two-step process for calculating attorney’s fees in a case of partial or limited success. A court must consider (1) whether “the plaintiff fail[ed] to prevail on claims that were unrelated to the claims on which he succeeded,” and (2) whether “the plaintiff aehiev[ed] a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award.” Id. at 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933. Deductions based on limited success are within the discretion of the district court. See Sorenson v. Mink, 239 F.3d 1140, 1147(9th Cir.2001).
