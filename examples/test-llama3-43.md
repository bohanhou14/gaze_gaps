The reference cases provided, 3 M.J. 414, 2 M.J. 1049, and 2 M.J. 1038, offer valuable insights into the concept of court-martial jurisdiction. In each case, the court has examined the criteria for establishing jurisdiction, particularly in cases involving off-post drug offenses.

In 3 M.J. 414, the court held that the sale of marijuana between two service members, though occurring off-post, was still subject to military jurisdiction due to the military connection. The court emphasized that the transaction was "engendered by on-post conversations and was military in its origin, military in its participants, and military in the destination and use of the marijuana."

Similarly, in 2 M.J. 1049, the court found that a service member's sale of heroin to a civilian undercover agent, though occurring off-post, was still subject to military jurisdiction. The court noted that the service member's actions were "clearly a violation of military rules and regulations" and that the military had a strong interest in maintaining the sanctity of its camps, posts, and stations.

In 2 M.J. 1038, the court examined the issue of jurisdiction in a case involving the sale of marijuana between two service members, with one being an informant working for the OSI. The court held that the sale was still subject to military jurisdiction, despite occurring off-post, due to the military connection.

In conclusion, the reference cases demonstrate that court-martial jurisdiction can be established even in cases involving off-post drug offenses, so long as there is a sufficient military connection. The courts have emphasized the importance of maintaining the sanctity of military installations and the military's interest in regulating the conduct of its members. Ultimately, the determination of jurisdiction depends on a detailed analysis of the facts under the criteria established in Relford v. Commandant, 401 U.S. 355, 91 S.Ct. 649, 28 L.Ed.2d 102 (1971).

gold_text: . Although McCarthy involved the sale of three pounds, we do not understand that the sale necessarily must involve such a large quantity to constitute a threat to the security of the installation especially where, as here, the purchase ostensibly was for the use of several persons. Also, we are aware of the possible implication by the Court of Military Appeals that a police-controlled buy can pose no actual threat to the military community. See United States v. Alef, 3 M.J. 414, 418 n. 12 (C.M.A. 1977). Such an interpretation of the Court’s remark would be inconsistent with its accompanying observation that the sale in Alef did not “appear” to involve a threat and that the locale of the sale and other circumstances are likewise relevant to the remoteness or probability that illicit substances will filter back into the military community. Moreover, this Court’s conclusions that jurisdiction can exist under similar circumstances recently have been affirmed. See, for example, United States v. Valles-Santana, 54 C.M.R. 383, 389 n. 10, 2 M.J. 1049 (A.C.M.R.1976), aff'd, 4 M.J. 84 (C.M.A. 1977); United States v. Ortiz-Negron, 54 C.M.R. 362, 365 n. 10, 2 M.J. 1038 (A.C.M.R. 1976), aff'd, 4 M.J. 84 (C.M.A.1977).
