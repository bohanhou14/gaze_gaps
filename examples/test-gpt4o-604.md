The defendant's argument that plaintiffs are time-barred from bringing suit under the ADEA because they did not file charges with the EEOC until November 4, 1991, — 492 days after the alleged discriminatory act — must be scrutinized under the applicable legal standards. In similar cases, it has been established that the routine transmittal of a complaint by the EEOC to the state agency satisfies the requirement to file initially with a state agency.

In Reference case 868 F.2d 172, the court held that the EEOC's transmission of a copy of the complaint to the state referral agency suffices to meet the 300-day filing requirement. The court emphasized that the EEOC's routine transmission of the complaint under a work-sharing agreement with the state agency fulfills the necessary requirement. Similarly, Reference case 841 F.2d 123 held that the EEOC's transmittal of the "Charge of Discrimination" form to the state agency the same day it was received by the EEOC was sufficient to institute state proceedings.

Applying these precedents, the plaintiffs' submission of written and signed statements to the TCHR in May of 1990, which detailed the alleged discriminatory acts, meets the ADEA's charge-filing requirements due to the work-sharing agreement between the TCHR and the EEOC. The EEOC’s transmission of these charges preserves the plaintiffs' right to pursue their claims within the 300-day time frame.

Thus, consistent with the holdings in 868 F.2d 172 and 841 F.2d 123, the plaintiffs' actions were timely, negating the defendant’s argument. Accordingly, defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment, is DENIED.

For the reasons explained above and consistent with relevant case law, the court finds that the plaintiffs have satisfied the ADEA's filing requirements, allowing their suit to proceed.
