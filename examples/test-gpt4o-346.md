APPLICABILITY OF JUDICIAL IMMUNITY

In examining the applicability of judicial immunity, it's essential to note the precedents that establish and define its parameters. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that judicial immunity provides absolute protection for judges performing judicial acts, even when such acts exceed their jurisdiction, as long as there is not a clear absence of all jurisdiction (Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099; Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547).

In Lopez v. Vanderwater, 620 F.2d 1229, the court highlighted instances where judicial immunity might not apply, particularly when non-judicial acts are performed under color of state law, resulting in constitutional violations. However, in the present case, there is no evidence to indicate that Magistrate Carr's actions fall outside the scope of judicial functions, nor has it been shown that he acted in the clear absence of jurisdiction.

Furthermore, in the case referenced as 742 F.2d 262, it’s reiterated that procedural errors and due process violations do not eliminate judicial immunity provided the judge acts within the court’s jurisdiction.

Plaintiff’s allegations against Magistrate Carr involve decisions regarding procedural matters, including the issuance of gag orders and disqualification of counsel, which are fundamentally judicial in nature. These actions are characteristic of functions performed by a judge in their official capacity and pertain directly to the administration of justice.

Given that Magistrate Carr’s actions do not deviate from judicial conduct as defined in existing jurisprudence and that he possessed the requisite jurisdiction over the matters involved, he is entitled to judicial immunity.

Therefore, this Court holds that Magistrate Carr's actions fall squarely within the ambit of judicial immunity. Consequently, plaintiff’s claims for monetary damages are barred, and defendant’s motion to dismiss is granted.

gold_text: Citing the case of Lopez v. Vanderwater, 620 F.2d 1229 (7th Cir.1980), plaintiff analogizes defendant’s conduct to the exercise of “prosecutorial powers.” Response at 6-7. The test enunciated in Sevier v. Turner, 742 F.2d 262, 272 (6th Cir.1984), is “whether initiating accusatory processes such as criminal prosecutions or civil contempt proceedings is a function normally performed by a judicial officer.” (Citing Stump, 435 U.S. at 362, 98 S.Ct. at 1107.) Plaintiff complains that in his orders of July 17 and July 18, 1984, “the Magistrate called upon the defendant’s law firm to conduct an investigation into the legal and personal activities of attorney Affeldt____” Response at 7. An examination of the orders, attached as exhibits to plaintiff's Response, does not show the Magistrate ordering any investigation. Rather, what appears is the Magistrate grappling with defendant’s motion to disqualify Affeldt. The Magistrate states that “it appears that certain readily ascertainable facts are in dispute, and that those facts may have some pertinence to the resolution in question.” July 19, 1984 Order at 1. The Magistrate asks defendant to supplement the record in support of this motion. Id. at 2. Such requests to supplement the record are made to assist the Court in rendering an informed decision; such requests are not in the nature of orders for independent investigations.
