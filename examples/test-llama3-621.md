The classification of collagen sausage casings is a complex issue that requires an examination of the statutory language, legislative history, and prior case law. In this case, the importer argues that the imported casings meet the criteria for "integument" and "prepared for use" under item 190.58, TSUS.

Referring to United States v. White, 8 Ct.Cust.App. 115, T.D. 37224 (1917), we can see that the term "integument" includes something that covers or encloses. In this case, the corium layer of the hide is the raw material that is used to produce the casings, which can be considered as covering or enclosing the sausage.

Moreover, the process of producing collagen casings is similar to the process of producing natural casings, as described in United States v. Brecht Corp., 25 CCPA 9, T.D. 48977 (1937). In this case, the court held that artificial sausage casings made from hide splits were not within the common meaning of "sausage casings" and were therefore not covered by item 190.58.

The legislative history of item 190.58 also supports the importer's argument. In the Tariff Classification Study, Explanatory and Background Materials, Schedule 1, 255 (1960), it is stated that the term "sausage casings" in paragraph 1755 has been construed to cover only casings made of animal integuments. This suggests that the term "integument" in item 190.58 is meant to cover not only natural casings but also artificial casings made from animal parts, such as the corium layer of the hide.

In conclusion, based on the statutory language, legislative history, and prior case law, we find that the imported collagen sausage casings meet the criteria for "integument" and "prepared for use" under item 190.58, TSUS, and are therefore duty-free.

Although it is urged that Congress intended to preclude from classification under item 190.58, sausage casings traditionally considered artificial, the language of the tariff provisions do not seem to support that distinction. Furthermore, “going behind the plain language of a statute in search of a possibly contrary congressional intent is ‘a step to be taken cautiously’ even under the best of circumstances.” American Tobacco Co. v.
