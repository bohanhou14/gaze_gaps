However, it is important to consider the principles from Twombly and Iqbal regarding the sufficiency of pleadings. In Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, the Court emphasized that a complaint requires "enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement" and must offer more than "mere parallel conduct." Similarly, Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, reaffirmed the necessity for pleadings to contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Liu's allegations, supported by detailed FTC findings and economic analysis, appear to meet the "plausibility" standard under these crucial precedents.

Additionally, Liu's complaint does not suffer from mere conclusory statements. It provides specific details, including documented instructions from U-Haul executives and corresponding price changes, thus shifting the claim from mere speculation to a plausible scenario of antitrust injury.

Furthermore, drawing from the principles noted in 597 F.3d 436, the inclusion of factual content that allows a reasonable inference of the defendant’s liability strengthens Liu's position. Her complaint includes such factual content, moving it beyond mere conjecture and aligning it with the standard required for a viable claim.

Therefore, given the considerations from Twombly and Iqbal, Liu has sufficiently pled her case to survive a motion to dismiss, offering plausible claims of injury that warrant judicial scrutiny and potential redress.

Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), require that facts and not mere generalities be set forth in a complaint, but only enough facts to make the claim plausible, and at this stage reasonable inferences are taken in favor of the pleader. SEC v. Tambone, 597 F.3d 436, 441 (1st Cir.2010). The place to test factual assertions for deficiencies and against conflicting evidence is at summary judgment or trial; Liu’s complaint is not “threadbare or speculative.” Peñalbert-Rosa v. Fortuño-Burset, 631 F.3d 592, 595 (1st Cir.2011).
