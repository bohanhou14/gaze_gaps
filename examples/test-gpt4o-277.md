The district court also found that the '315 patent claims were anticipated by prior art, thereby rendering them invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 102. Anticipation requires that a single prior art reference disclose each and every element of the claimed invention as arranged in the claim. The court must determine whether the prior art reference placed the invention in the possession of someone of ordinary skill in the field. This standard was elaborated in Richardson v. Suzuki Motor Co., 868 F.2d 1226, 1236 (Fed.Cir.1989) and Akzo N.V. v. United States Int’l Trade Comm’n, 808 F.2d 1471, 1479 (Fed.Cir.1986), cert. denied, 482 U.S. 909 (1987), as cited in Reference Case 911 F.2d 705.

The district court reviewed evidence suggesting that prior art push rods embodied each claim element of the ‘315 patent. However, our review applies the clear error standard to the district court’s factual finding of anticipation (Glaverbel Societe Anonyme v. Northlake Mktg. & Supply, 45 F.3d 1550, 1554 (Fed.Cir.1995); Lindemann Maschinenfabrik GMBH v. American Hoist & Derrick Co., 730 F.2d 1452, 1458 (Fed.Cir.1984)), as noted in Reference Case 66 F.3d 299.

Upon examining the prior art, we conclude that the district court erroneously determined that every element of the claimed invention in the ‘315 patent was explicitly or inherently disclosed in the prior art. Therefore, the summary judgment of anticipation is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

In conclusion, the judgment of invalidation based on anticipation is reversed, while the indefiniteness decision is vacated, warranting further district court proceedings.

gold_text: Invalidity based on “anticipation” requires that the invention is not in fact new. See, e.g., Hoover Group, Inc. v. Custom Metalcraft, Inc., 66 F.3d 299, 302, 36 USPQ2d 1101, 1103 (Fed.Cir.1995) (“lack of novelty (often called ‘anticipation’) requires that the same invention, including each element and limitation of the claims, was known or used by others before it was invented by the patentee”). A single reference must describe the claimed invention with sufficient precision and detail to establish that the subject matter existed in the prior art. See, e.g., In re Spado, 911 F.2d 705, 708, 15 USPQ2d 1655, 1657 (Fed.Cir.1990) (“the reference must describe the applicant’s claimed invention sufficiently to have placed a person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention in possession of it”).
