The case involves a suit brought by Patricia Kane against Detective Russell Whitcomb, a police officer of the City of Helena, Lewis and Clark County, and others. Kane claims that Whitcomb caused her unlawful arrest in violation of her constitutional rights.

The court must consider whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged and, if so, whether the right was clearly established. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). Kane alleges that the facts related in Whitcomb's affidavit did not give probable cause to lawfully arrest Kane because it was clearly established that taking funds from a joint account could not constitute theft. However, the court finds that there was sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that the crime of theft had been committed by Kane.

The court also holds that the constitutional right was not clearly established. The Supreme Court has emphasized that this inquiry must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition. "The relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted." Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202.

In this case, Whitcomb completed his investigation and prepared an affidavit reasonably believing that there was probable cause that Kane had committed the crime of theft. He confirmed his belief by taking the affidavit to the County Attorney who agreed. It was only after that, that he took his affidavit together with the complaint to the judge to seek a warrant for Kane's arrest. It would be clear to a reasonable officer conducting the investigation with the precautions taken that there was probable cause to arrest Kane for theft.

The court also notes that the district court's grant of summary judgment was based on the assumption that Kane could establish that a constitutional right was violated. However, the court finds that there was no constitutional violation because there was probable cause for the arrest. Pierce v. City of Oklahoma, 907 F.2d 879, 884 (1990).

In conclusion, the court finds that there was sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that the crime of theft had been committed by Kane and that the constitutional right was not clearly established. Therefore, the court grants summary judgment in favor of Whitcomb and against Kane.

gold_text: Kane’s argument against the County is based entirely on County Attorney McGrath’s assistance to Whitcomb in preparing a complaint to be used in obtaining an arrest warrant. At the hearing in the district court Kane’s counsel stated that he is aware of no County policy under which McGrath acted. The court added that the record revealed none. To state a claim against a county, a plaintiff must allege and establish that a county policy, practice, or custom caused the violation of the plaintiffs constitutional right. Pierce v. Multnomah County, 76 F.3d 1032, 1039 (9th Cir.1996). There is no vicarious or respondent superior liability under § 1983. Los Angeles Police Protective League v. Gates, 907 F.2d 879, 889 (9th Cir.1990). There is also no showing that McGrath, with the single act of preparing the complaint for Whitcomb to sign, even if acting as a policy maker for the county, acted with deliberate indifference as required by Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 407, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997).
