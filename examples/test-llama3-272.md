Based on the reference cases, I agree with the Court's conclusion that the Creditors hold a security interest in the Residence despite the fact that their claim was reduced to a foreclosure judgment pre-petition. In the case of In re Perry, 945 F.2d 61, the Court held that a creditor whose claim was secured only by the debtor's residence had reduced its claim to a foreclosure judgment pre-petition, and the debtor's plan proposed to pay the secured claim in full during the term of the plan. The Court concluded that the plan did not provide for payment of the secured claim in full, and the creditor's security interest was not adequately protected.

Similarly, in the case of In re Coleman, 82 B.R. 15, the Court held that a foreclosure judgment is not a lien "created by an agreement" and therefore is not a security interest. The Court also noted that the purpose of Chapter 13 is to enable an individual, under court supervision and protection, to develop and perform under a plan for the repayment of his debts over an extended period.

In the present case, the Creditors' lien was created by the Deed of Trust, which was recorded in 1991. The Deed of Trust granted the Creditors a security interest in the Residence to secure the Debt. Although the Creditors reduced their claim to a foreclosure judgment pre-petition, the security interest remains intact unless the judgment expressly cancels or avoids it. Since the Judgment does not cancel or avoid the Deed of Trust, the Creditors' lien is not a judicial lien.

Therefore, the Court correctly denied the Debtors' motion to avoid the Creditors' lien and granted the Creditors' motion for relief from the automatic stay. The Creditors' security interest in the Residence is protected, and the Debtors must continue to make payments to the Creditors as specified in the Plan.

Perry, 945 F.2d 61, 63 (3rd Cir.1991) (a case cited by the Creditors), the Perry court notes that, in In re Coleman, 82 B.R. 15, 18 (Bankr.D.N.J.1988), a bankruptcy court concluded that § 1322(b)(2) did not apply to a security interest that had been reduced to a foreclosure judgment pre-petition because the foreclosure judgment was not a lien created by an agreement and therefore did not qualify as a "security interest” under the Bankruptcy Code.
