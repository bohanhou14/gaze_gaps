The case at hand involves a tragic accident at a public swimming pool operated by the City of Hope, Arkansas. The plaintiff, William Bertie Handley, is seeking damages for the death of his 11-year-old daughter, Margaret Yvonne Handley, who drowned in the pool on June 23, 1954. The defendant, the City of Hope, asserts that it is immune from liability due to its operation of the pool in a governmental capacity.

The court notes that the City of Hope created a Commission to operate recreational facilities, including the swimming pool, in accordance with Arkansas statutes. The Commission employed a full-time Parks and Recreation Director and assistants, and the pool was maintained at a deficit. The court finds that the pool was being operated for a public purpose, and therefore, the City is immune from liability.

The plaintiff attempts to argue that the pool was an attractive nuisance, but the court finds this contention to be without merit. Furthermore, the court notes that even if the attractive nuisance doctrine could be applied, it is doubtful whether it could be applied to the operation of a public swimming pool.

The plaintiff also attempts to argue that the City entered into a contract with the deceased and breached that contract, but the court finds that this argument lacks merit. The court notes that the Coats case, 175 Ark. 289, 299 S.W. 355, involved a franchise given by the city, and the Morgan case, 217 Ark. 161, 229 S.W.2d 133, involved an express contract. Neither of these cases involved an implied contract.

In conclusion, the court finds that the City of Hope is immune from liability due to its operation of the pool in a governmental capacity. The court relies on the Arkansas statutes, as well as the cases of Yoes v. City of Fort Smith, 207 Ark. 694, 182 S.W.2d 683, and Hannon v. City of Waterbury, 106 Conn. 13, 136 A. 876, 877, 57 A.L.R. 402. The court also notes that the cases of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, and Briggs v. Elliott, 349 U.S. 294, are not relevant to the issue at hand.

gold_text: Plaintiffâ€™s final contention is that the pool was not being operated in a governmental capacity since it was not open to all members of the public, i. e., it was limited to members of the Caucasian race. Plaintiff relies upon the case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873, as implemented in 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083.
