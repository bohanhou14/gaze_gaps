D. APPLICATION OF MONTANA EXCEPTIONS

In examining whether the Montana exceptions apply, we first consider whether the Cooperatives have entered into a consensual relationship with the Three Affiliated Tribes. The evidence indicates that the Cooperatives provide telecommunications services to both Indian and non-Indian members on the Reservation through rights-of-way granted by the Secretary of the Interior. However, as emphasized in Montana v. U.S., 450 U.S. 544, a consensual relationship must stem from explicit commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements between the tribe and nonmembers.

None of these conditions appear to be fulfilled in this case. The Cooperatives’ use of the rights-of-way does not inherently constitute a consensual relationship with the Tribe merely by virtue of serving the Reservation’s residents (450 U.S. 544, 565). Furthermore, the Supreme Court has clarified in Strate v. A-1 Contractors that receipt of tribal services like police or fire protection alone does not create the necessary connection to establish a consensual relationship under Montana's first exception (532 U.S. 645).

Therefore, without a clear consensual relationship directly involving the Tribes’ approval and participation, the first Montana exception does not justify the Three Affiliated Tribes' possessory interest tax.

Moreover, the second Montana exception, which applies when the non-member conduct threatens the Tribe’s political integrity, economic security, health, or welfare, similarly does not support the tax. The activities of the Cooperatives, specifically the maintenance of telecommunication lines, do not demonstrate a direct threat to the Tribe’s interests that would warrant the exercise of tribal regulatory authority (450 U.S. 544, 566).

Consequently, under the Montana framework and subsequent jurisprudence, such as Strate and Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, the possessory interest tax lacks a sufficient legal basis. As a result, the Court finds that the possessory interest tax imposed by the Three Affiliated Tribes is not lawfully applicable to the Cooperatives' rights-of-way on the Reservation.

gold_text: The first Montana exception applies when “a tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribes or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements.” Montana v. U.S., 450 U.S. 544, 565, 101 S.Ct. 1245; see Atkinson Trading Co., Inc. v. Shirley, 532 U.S. 645, 656, 121 S.Ct. 1825, 149 L.Ed.2d 889 (2001) (“Montana’s consensual relationship exception requires that the tax or regulation imposed by the Indian tribe have a nexus to the consensual relationship itself’). The Court concludes, as a matter of law, that the Cooperatives have not entered into a “consensual relationship” with the tribe or its members as a result of providing telecommunication services on the Reservation, or as a result of the sale and service of telephone equipment.
