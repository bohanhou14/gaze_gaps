In the context of legal cases, it is essential to consider the factors that determine whether a stay should be lifted or not. In the case of <Reference case 642 F.3d 865>, the court ruled that the automatic stay did not apply to one of the issues raised by Chizzali in his appeal. Similarly, in the case of <Reference case 642 F.3d 865>, the court held that Chizzali was entitled to relief from the stay on one of his issues before the Colorado appellate court.

In the present case, the Creditors seek relief from the automatic stay to continue the State Court Lawsuit in that forum. The court must consider the factors suggested in the case of <Reference case In re Curtis, 40 B.R. 795 (Bankr.D.Utah 1984)> to guide its analysis. These factors include whether the relief will result in a partial or complete resolution of the issues, whether the foreign proceeding involves the debtor as a fiduciary, and whether the judgment claim arising from the foreign action is subject to equitable subordination under Section 510(c).

In this case, the court finds that each applicable factor favors granting relief from stay. The court notes that allowing the State Court Lawsuit to proceed will likely result in the resolution of questions of fact and liability that are significant in both Debtors' bankruptcy cases. The court also finds that the State Court Lawsuit has progressed to the point where the parties are prepared for trial, and that allowing the lawsuit to proceed will not interfere with the Debtors' bankruptcy cases.

Therefore, the court grants relief from stay and allows the State Court Lawsuit to proceed. The court's decision is guided by the principles of judicial economy and the expeditious and economical determination of litigation for the parties. The court's ruling is consistent with the holdings in <Reference case 642 F.3d 865> and <Reference case 642 F.3d 865>, which emphasize the importance of considering the factors that determine whether a stay should be lifted or not.

gold_text: The Court has considered each of the applicable Curtis factors and finds that they support granting relief from stay in order to allow the State Court Lawsuit to proceed. The Court has also considered the “likelihood of success” factor applied in the case of Chizzali v. Gindi (In re Gindi), 642 F.3d 865 (10th Cir.2011), overruled on other grounds.by TW Telecom Holdings Inc. v. Carolina Internet Ltd., 661 F.3d 495 (10th Cir.2011). See In re Hruby, 512 B.R. at 270-71. As in Hruby, the Court treads lightly when it comes to rendering opinions as to a likely resolution of the factual and legal issues involved in the State Court Lawsuit, but the Court finds that the Creditors have sufficiently shown a likelihood of success that they should be allowed to proceed.
