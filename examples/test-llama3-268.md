MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

In this action, Plaintiffs bring claims of malicious prosecution and abuse of process after they were named by Defendant in a lawsuit alleging copyright infringement. In the copyright infringement action, Plaintiffs were granted summary judgment, and the presiding District Judge found that Plaintiffs had not infringed the copyright. The nature of the instant discovery dispute relates to Plaintiffs’ efforts to obtain discovery regarding (1) the validity of Defendant’s copyright; and (2) a settlement agreement and related documents from a malicious prosecution case filed by another defendant in the copyright infringement action.

The Wolfes argue that documents and testimony related to the copyright registration of the Standard Details are relevant because it was fundamental to Fresenius’s claims in NMC I that it prove the Standard Details were copyrighted and entitled to copyright protection. They contend that “[rjelevant to those issues is whether the Standard Details were properly and accurately copyrighted; the scope of copyright protection afforded thereby; and whether the materials submitted and actions culminating in the registration of the Standard Details were proper, accurate and correct.” (Reference case 418 F.3d 138)

Fresenius argues that the documents related to its copyright are not relevant because the validity of its copyright was litigated and decided in the underlying action. Fresenius asserts that res judicata and collateral estoppel bar the discovery sought by the Wolfes. The court finds that the claims in NMC I and the instant matter arise out of different sets of operative facts, and thus res judicata does not preclude discovery related to the validity of the copyright. (Reference case 309 F.3d 1263)

Moreover, the court finds that the issue of the validity of the copyright was actually litigated in NMC I, and Fresenius had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous forum. The court concludes that collateral estoppel does not bar the discovery sought by the Wolfes. (Reference case 804 F.2d 116)

Therefore, the court grants the Wolfes’ Motion to Compel Discovery, and orders Fresenius to produce the documents and deposition testimony related to the copyright registration of the Standard Details.

gold_text: The Wolfes argue, relying on Uzdavines v. Weeks Marine, Inc., 418 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir.2005), that the issues of the validity of Fresenius’s copyright and Gokcen’s infringement thereof were not actually litigated in light of the stipulation between Gokcen and Fresenius in which Gokcen stipulated that he copied portions of the standard details. In Uzdavines, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit acknowledged that “[m]ost courts have held that a fact established in prior litigation by stipulation, rather than by judicial resolution, has not been ‘actually litigated.’ ” Id. (citing United States v. Botefuhr, 309 F.3d 1263, 1282-83 (10th Cir.2002); United States v. Young, 804 F.2d 116, 118 (8th Cir.1986); 18 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice § 132.03[2][h][i] (3d ed.2005)). In Uzdavines, the court found, however, that where the parties intended a stipulation to be binding in future litigation, issues to which the parties have stipulated will be considered “actually litigated” for the purpose of collateral estoppel. Id. at 146-47.
