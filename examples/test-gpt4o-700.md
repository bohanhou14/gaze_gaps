D. Jurisdictional Issue of Simultaneous Filings

The propriety of the filing of the Chapter 13 petition while the Chapter 7 case was still pending raises significant jurisdictional issues. This court must consider cases such as In re Bodine, 113 B.R. 134 (Bankr.W.D.N.Y.1990) and In re Kosenka, 104 B.R. 40 (Bankr.N.D.Ind.1989). These cases clarify that a debtor is not permitted to file a second bankruptcy case prior to the entry of discharge in an earlier proceeding (117 B.R. 415). 

As detailed in the Turners' case, they filed their Chapter 13 petition while the Chapter 7 case was ongoing without discharge. This mirrors the situation in In re Bodine, where the court emphasized that each bankruptcy must be administered as a single estate under one Chapter of the Code (204 B.R. 310).

Furthermore, the Supreme Court in Freshman v. Atkins, 269 U.S. 121 (1925) established that filing a second application for discharge instead of waiting for closure of the first represents an abuse of process (156 B.R. 353). 

Therefore, considering the precedent set forth in these cases, the Turners' simultaneous filing of Chapter 13 while Chapter 7 was still pending without discharge appears inappropriate (104 B.R. 40). Absent a resolution of this jurisdictional issue, the Turners are unlikely to demonstrate a substantial possibility of success on appeal.

Conclusion

Given the Turners' failure to meet the necessary criteria for granting a stay pending appeal, particularly in light of the jurisdictional impropriety of their simultaneous filings, the motion for a stay is denied.

gold_text: There is a decided difference of opinion over whether a debtor may ever simultaneously maintain two separate bankruptcy proceedings. In re Jones, 117 B.R. 415, 421 (Bankr.N.D.Ind.1990). In the first line of cases, courts have read an old Supreme Court opinion to be a strict prohibition against ever having two cases open simultaneously. In re Heywood, 39 B.R. 910, 911 (Bankr.W.D.N.Y.1984) (citing Freshman v. Atkins, 269 U.S. 121, 46 S.Ct. 41, 70 L.Ed. 193 (1925)). The Heywood court premised its holding on the fact that a debtor possesses only one estate for the purpose of trusteeship and each bankruptcy must be administered as a single estate under a single chapter of the Bankruptcy Code. This continues to be the majority view. Norwalk Savings Society v. Peia (In re Peia), 204 B.R. 310, 314 (Bankr.D.Conn.1996). A minority view soon developed in some courts which declined to adopt a per se rule against such filings and permit a debtor to file a chapter 7, receive his or her discharge, and then file a second petition under chapter 13 to reorganize the debts which have not been discharged although certain administrative acts of the chapter 7 case such as the trustee’s filing of a final report have not already been completed. In re Hodurski, 156 B.R. 353 (Bankr.D.Mass.1993); In re Kosenka, 104 B.R. 40 (Bankr.N.D.Ind.1989); Frenz, 142 B.R. at 614 n. 2 (citing cases). While the majority view may be viewed as an absolutist position, the minority view does run the risk of making available “an easy avenue for abuse of the bankruptcy system” that would allow debtors to file multiple cases if they do not achieve their intended goal in a particular case. In re Bodine, 113 B.R. 134, 135 (Bankr.W.D.N.Y.1990).
