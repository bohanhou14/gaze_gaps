E. Claims under Other Federal Statutes

Although the primary matter revolves around Title IX applicability, Plaintiff's reference to Title VII and other federal statutes warrants a brief examination. The Supreme Court in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, has previously held that damages actions may be maintained under Title VII against a state, suggesting the possibility of abrogating the Eleventh Amendment barrier. However, the same clarity does not extend to Title IX (Reference case 864 F.2d 881), indicating an unresolved legal territory regarding its applicability to state-run institutions.

In Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S. 274, the court emphasized that for Title IX claims to be successful against an institution, there must be clear evidentiary support showing that school officials with the authority to address the alleged discrimination had actual knowledge of the misconduct and failed to adequately respond. This further underscores the difficulty in applying Title IX in contexts traditionally governed by employment relations laws such as Title VII.

Given the unresolved state of Title IX's reach and the distinctions drawn by precedence, extending Title IX to Defendant’s medical residency program constitutes an overreach not supported by current legal frameworks.

Accordingly, Plaintiff's federal claims are inadequately grounded both in statutory interpretation and prevailing judicial decisions, compelling dismissal. Counts I-III, therefore, cannot sustain.

IV. Conclusion

Defendant’s residency program does not qualify as an education program under Title IX. Plaintiff's hostile environment claim is also untimely. Consequently, Plaintiff's state law claims will not be entertained under supplemental jurisdiction, thus dismissed without prejudice.

An appropriate Order follows.

Lip; sett, however, has been abrogated in substantial part by the Supreme Court’s decision in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S. 274, 286, 118 S.Ct. 1989, 141 L.Ed.2d 277 (1998). Gebser rejected the Lip-sett court’s attempt to equate Title IX to Title VII by noting conceptual differences between the statutes and setting a higher bar for institutional liability under Title IX (actual knowledge and deliberate indifference) than is applied in Title VII cases.
