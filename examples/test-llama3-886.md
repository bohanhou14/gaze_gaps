The case at hand involves a Florida state prisoner, Lester Fisher, who appeals the denial of his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 habeas corpus petition. Fisher claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him of his eligibility for Violent Career Criminal (VCC) status and the sentencing implications of that status. The Florida court rejected Fisher's ineffective assistance claim, finding that he failed to show prejudice.

The Eleventh Circuit reviews the district court's denial of habeas relief de novo. Under AEDPA, a federal court may only grant habeas relief if the state court's decision was "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law" or "was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding." 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).

The court concludes that the Florida court's decision was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. The court finds that the Florida court's factual finding that Fisher was aware of his maximum exposure on all of his pending charges, including the four robberies and the burglary and drug possession charges, was reasonable.

The court also concludes that the Florida court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law. The court notes that the Supreme Court has held that a petitioner must show a reasonable probability that he would have accepted a plea offer if he had been advised of the maximum sentence and the mandatory minimum applicable under the VCC statute. Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1376, 1385 (2012).

In conclusion, the Eleventh Circuit affirms the denial of Fisher's habeas petition, finding that the Florida court's decision was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.

gold_text: A state court decision is “contrary to” clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing Supreme Court precedent or arrives at a different result than the Supreme Court in the face of materially indistinguishable facts. Burton v. Comm’r, Ala. Dept of Corr., 700 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir.2012). An “unreasonable application” of clearly established federal law occurs if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle from Supreme Court precedent but “unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case.” Id. (quoting Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 694, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002)) (quotation marks omitted). Relief is not available under this prong of § 2254(d) if the state court’s application of federal law is “merely wrong.” Woodall, 134 S.Ct. at 1702. Rather, the application must be “objectively unreasonable” to warrant relief. Id. (the state court’s error must be “well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement”).
