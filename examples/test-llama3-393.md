In the case of Grigoryan v. Holder, the petition for review is granted in part and denied in part. The petitioner, Grigoryan, is a native and citizen of Armenia who seeks asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (CAT) relief. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denied his application, finding that he was not eligible for asylum because he failed to establish that the persecution he experienced was on account of any of the statutory grounds.

However, the court finds that Grigoryan has met the heavy burden of proof required to establish past persecution. He presented substantial evidence that he was retaliated against because he exposed governmental corruption, including the murder of his father and the corruption of government officials. The court cites reference case 205 F.3d 1177, Grava v. INS, which held that official retaliation against those who expose and prosecute governmental corruption may constitute persecution on account of political opinion.

The court also references case 380 F.3d 1114, which established that when an alien alleges mistreatment on account of political opinion, he may satisfy the nexus between conduct that rises to a persecutory level and his actual or imputed political opinion by showing that he was retaliated against because he exposed or threatened to expose governmental corruption.

Based on the evidence presented, the court finds that Grigoryan suffered past persecution for asylum and withholding of removal purposes and that the BIA's determination to the contrary was in error. The court remands the case to the BIA to consider whether there are changed country conditions or other reasons to deny relief.

Finally, the court denies Grigoryan's claim to CAT relief, finding that the evidence does not compel a determination that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured in Armenia.
