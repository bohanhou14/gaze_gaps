In the case of Coldiron v. U.S. Department of Justice, the court has to decide whether the FBI's invocation of FOIA Exemption 1 is proper. The court must review the FBI's Vaughn index and declaration to determine whether the agency has properly classified the documents as secret and whether the withheld information falls within the scope of Exemption 1.

As mentioned in reference case 71 F.3d 885, the court must require an agency invoking Exemption 1 to show that it "tailored its response to a specific set of documents." The FBI's declaration provides enough detail to allow the court to find that it has properly invoked Exemption 1. The FBI identifies three documents, and identifies redactions made on each page of each document. Its identification of the withheld information on each page of each document is generic, but it provides several pieces of information that make its declaration seem tailored to specific documents.

The court must also consider the segregability analysis, as mentioned in reference case 779 F.2d 1378. The FBI has redacted exempt information and produced any relevant non-exempt information. If an agency cannot show that certain material in a document is exempt but cannot be reasonably segregated from non-exempt information, that agency must also describe what proportion of the information is non-exempt and how that material is disbursed throughout the document.

In conclusion, the court grants the FBI's summary judgment motion because the FBI's invocation of Exemption 1 is proper. The FBI has provided enough detail to show that it has properly classified the documents as secret and the withheld information falls within the scope of Exemption 1. The court has reviewed the FBI's Vaughn index and declaration and found that the agency has properly followed the procedures set forth in FOIA. Therefore, the FBI's redactions are justified under Exemption 1 and the court grants summary judgment in favor of the defendant.

Coldiron attempts to reserve the right to contest the sufficiency of the FBI’s search: "To the extent that these documents [that might explain why the INS suspended Coldiron’s security clearance] have not been discovered through their search, Ms [sic] Col-diron contends that the search may have been inadequate.” See id. However, the FBI need only demonstrate that its search was reasonable, not that it retrievéd all responsive documents. See Nation Magazine v. U.S. Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885; 892 n. 7 (D.C.Cir.1995); Miller v. U.S. Dep't of State, 779 F.2d 1378, 1383 (8th Cir.1985). According to this standard, FBI’s search was adequate..
