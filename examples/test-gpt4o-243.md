III. CONCLUSION

The application of judicial estoppel is a crucial tool in ensuring the integrity of the judicial process, particularly in bankruptcy proceedings. The precedents, such as In re Superior Crewboats, Inc., 374 F.3d 330, clearly establish that a debtor's failure to disclose claims can lead to estoppel if a financial motive for concealment exists. Love's argument of inadvertence lacks substantiation, especially given his potential for personal gain from nondisclosure.

Similarly, as noted in In re Coastal Plains, Inc., 179 F.3d 197, 207-08, the disclosure requirement is ongoing and applies to contingent claims, which Love failed to meet. The requirement for full and honest disclosure, as emphasized in Johnson v. Oregon Dept. of Human Resources, 141 F.3d 1361, 1364 (9th Cir.1998), and reiterated across various cases, underscores the significance of this fundamental principle.

Therefore, discerning no factual dispute regarding Love's inadvertence and in alignment with precedents, we uphold the district court's ruling. Love's nondisclosure was not inadvertent, and judicial estoppel is appropriately applied in this context to prevent any manipulation of the judicial system to suit individual convenience. Accordingly, the district court's judgment is AFFIRMED.

gold_text: What appears to drive the dissent is a desire to change the law in a way that would prevent nearly every application of judicial estoppel in the bankruptcy context. Time and time again, however, judicial estoppel has been applied by this court and others far more broadly than the dissent’s reasoning would allow. See, e.g., In re Superior Crewboats, Inc., 374 F.3d 330; In re Coastal Plains, Inc., 179 F.3d 197; Kamont v. West, 83 Fed.Appx. 1 (5th Cir.2003). Although the dissent attempts to distinguish our precedent applying judicial estoppel in the bankruptcy context, the distinctions do not hold up when the dissent’s rationale is followed to its logical end. Under the dissent’s analysis, if it is theoretically possible that a non-disclosing debtor is pursuing claims for the benefit of his creditors (because the claims are property of the estate), then a court must assume that the debtor is, in fact, acting on his creditors’ behalf and that any nondisclosure of those claims was inadvertent. However, under this rationale, a dishonest debtor could, in almost every case, conceal his claims from his creditors and assert them without his creditors’ knowledge unless an opponent forced disclosure. Upon being forced to disclose his claims, a debt- or could then amend his schedules to include the claims, as Love did here, or take other corrective action, and his nondisclosure would be considered inadvertent. However, this court has observed that “ ‘[allowing [the debtor] to back-up, reopen the bankruptcy case, and amend his bankruptcy filings, only after his omission has been challenged by an adversary, suggests that a debtor should consider disclosing personal assets only if he is caught concealing them.’ ” In re Superior Crewboats, Inc., 374 F.3d at 336 (second alteration in original) (quoting Burnes v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., 291 F.3d 1282, 1288 (11th Cir.2002)); see also Thompson, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48409, at *23 (stating that “[a] plaintifftdebtor should not be allowed to amend a bankruptcy petition only after his omission has been challenged by an adversary”) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We decline to invite such abuses here.
