Ms. Robert contends that the district court erred in denying her request for discovery and an evidentiary hearing regarding the ex parte communications. However, limitations on discovery in IRS summons enforcement proceedings are well-established. The Supreme Court and several circuit courts have recognized that a district court may limit discovery in these proceedings. For instance, in **United States v. Claes**, the Eighth Circuit emphasized that a taxpayer must make a substantial preliminary showing of abuse of the court's process before even limited discovery is warranted (747 F.2d 491, 496). Similarly, the Eighth Circuit held in United States v. Moon, that discovery is the exception rather than the rule in enforcement proceedings (616 F.2d 1043, 1047).

In this case, Ms. Robert has not provided sufficient evidence to suggest bad faith or that enforcement of the summonses would constitute an abuse of the court’s process. The district court correctly noted that Ms. Robert cited no precedent establishing that a violation of the IRS’s internal regulations against ex parte communications invalidates any subsequently-issued summonses (614 F.2d 914). The necessity for discovery and a final evidentiary hearing only arises in instances where the court remains unable to decide on the merits of the enforcement based on the initial presentation, as addressed in **Reference case 658 F.2d 526**.

Therefore, although Ms. Robert raises valid concerns about ex parte communications, these alone do not meet the burden established in previous rulings. Upholding the district court's decision aligns with the limitations on discovery and the heavy burden required to challenge IRS summons enforcement (866 F.2d 1015).

gold_text: We next address Ms. Robert’s arguments concerning the district court’s denial of discovery. Discovery is not necessary in every summons action, and, in fact, the summary nature of proceedings on an IRS summons militate against expansive discovery. See United States v. Stuart, 489 U.S. 353, 369, 109 S.Ct. 1183, 103 L.Ed.2d 388 (1989) (“ ‘[Sjummons enforcement proceedings should be summary in nature and discovery should be limited.’ ” (quoting S.Rep. No. 97-494, Vol. 1, p. 285 (1982))). However, in many cases, some discovery is appropriate and should be allowed. See United States v. Kis, 658 F.2d 526, 540 (7th Cir.1981) (“[W]e do not want to put the taxpayer in the anomalous position of having to allege specific facts when he has no means to gather that information through discovery ....”); United States v. Cortese, 614 F.2d 914, 921 n. 12 (3d Cir.1980) (“[I]n almost every case, the information needed to demonstrate an improper motive on the part of the Service is in the hands of the government. Normally, the taxpayer’s only access to such information is through limited basic discovery carefully tailored to the purposes of the inquiry. Accordingly, such discovery should be provided.”). To strike a balance between the summary nature of summons proceedings and the relative disadvantage taxpayers face regarding access to information, we have held that discovery in a summary summons proceeding is appropriate where a taxpayer makes a substantial preliminary showing that enforcement of a summons would result in an abuse of the court’s process.
