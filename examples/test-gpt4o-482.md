In support of the defendant's claim that a lack of legal representation during his previous convictions could affect their validity under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), we refer to 36 F.3d 187. In that case, the district court found no clear error in determining whether Tracy was unrepresented, noting the insufficiency of affidavits and the possible loss of records due to a flood. In contrast, our case involves affirmative records indicating representation by Leo McGowan, underscoring the challenge in overturning presumptions of counsel presence.

Additionally, referencing 372 U.S. 335, which highlights the paramount importance of legal representation in criminal proceedings, the court there firmly established the necessity of counsel for a fair trial. This precedent emphasizes the fundamental role of ensuring defendants have legal support, which impacts our scrutiny of Joost’s claimed lack of counsel during his 1964 convictions. Given the docket evidence against Joost’s claim, his argument appears less tenable.

Therefore, while significant weight is given to ensuring fair trials through legal representation as underscored by 372 U.S. 335, the documentary evidence indicating presence of counsel in Joost’s prior convictions (aligned with the scrutiny in 36 F.3d 187) leads this court to uphold the validity of those convictions as predicates under § 924(e).

gold_text: The district court found nothing in the records to hint of invalidity and viewed defendant’s statement to be completely incredible. The court noted, as well, that the convictions had been entered more than a year after Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), had required counsel in felony cases and that Rhode Island had, for more than twenty years before the convictions, followed the practice of appointing counsel in such cases. We detect no error in the court’s ruling that defendant failed to produce sufficient credible evidence to rebut the presumption of constitutional validity that arose from introduction of certified copies of the convictions. See United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 187, 197 (1st Cir.1994).
