**Generation:**

In the present case, the dispute centers around the contractual obligations and the failure of the administrative agency to agree on the amounts due the claimants, which is reminiscent of the challenges observed in *G. L. Christian and Associates* cases (160 Ct. Cl. 1 and 312 F.2d 418). The plaintiffs' claims involve the residuals from the Fort Polk housing contract under the Capehart Act. Both references, 160 Ct. Cl. 1 and 312 F.2d 418, illustrate scenarios where detailed contractual negotiations and the outcomes of subsequent administrative disagreements played pivotal roles.

Particularly, in *G. L. Christian and Associates*, the financial interests of the plaintiff were curiously unaffected by the contract's termination. Much like the situation here, the plaintiffs had to navigate the complexities arising from an administrative standstill over the claim amounts, ultimately leading them to seek judicial relief. These reference cases highlight the intricate interplay between contractual terms and administrative enforcement, providing a precedent backdrop for understanding the current contractual impasse. Thus, the reliance on established contractual interpretations and the historical context provided by prior rulings is vital in resolving the present litigation.

gold_text: The invitation for bids in this case, which was clearly issued prior to the receipt of the circular, was not required to contain the new clause. Plaintiffs strained argument for a contrary interpretation is rejected. The circular did not mandate the payment of interest on this claim. Plaintiffs argument based on G. L. Christian & Associates v. United States, 160 Ct. Cl. 1, 312 F.2d 418, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 954 (1963), therefore necessarily fails. Without inclusion of the clause being mandated by law, there is no basis for application of the Christian Doctrine. We, therefore, do not reach the arguments of the parties on this issue.
