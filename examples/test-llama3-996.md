Based on the reference articles provided, I can help you analyze the legal cases. 

In case 309 U.S. 134, the court discusses the issue of discretion by the expert body, which is the Federal Power Commission (FPC). The court concludes that the FPC has the authority to decide the scope of the inquiry, whether applications should be heard contemporaneously or successively, and whether parties should be allowed to intervene in one another's proceedings. This decision is based on the Communications Act, which is designed to maintain a grip on the dynamic aspects of radio transmission.

In case 423 U.S. 326, the court reviews an order entered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The court holds that the order is not a final order to permit judicial review. The court concludes that the FERC has the authority to make changes to the order sua sponte, and that the change from January 1st to a future date was made without requiring new evidence to be received. The court also notes that the FERC has the authority to reconsider its previous decisions and revert to the status quo ante.

In the given case, I would analyze it based on the principles discussed in the two reference cases. I would conclude that the FERC has the authority to make changes to the order sua sponte, and that the change from January 1st to a future date was made without requiring new evidence to be received. I would also conclude that the FERC has the authority to reconsider its previous decisions and revert to the status quo ante.
