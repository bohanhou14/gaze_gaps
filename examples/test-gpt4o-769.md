In addressing the contention that the Secretary’s determination regarding eligibility for Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits is flawed, we observe precedent in reference cases 570 F. Supp. 41 and 570 F. Supp. 41, where ancillary and support services did not fulfill eligibility criteria. Plaintiffs at the Dana Corporation’s Marion, Indiana plant, argued that increased imports directly impacted their employment, rendering all workers eligible for benefits. However, the court found substantial evidence supporting the Secretary's denial for production workers while remanding the case for service workers due to an uneven distribution of services across departments.

Similarly, in the present case, the methodology employed by Labor for certification must be scrutinized closely. Per the remand findings in Bennett v. United States Secretary of Labor, the Secretary must thoroughly investigate allegations, ensure robust evidence collection, and validate the relevance of such information. Labor should amend its approach when evidence of import substitution and worker separation due to corporate restructuring emerges, drawing parallels with the ancillary services determinations previously rebuked for lack of substantial evidence.

Labor’s efforts to engage witness testimonies and supplemental employer statements were deemed insufficient in supporting the initial negative determination. Similarly, in both 570 F. Supp. 41 judgments, when the court remanded service worker determinations, it emphasized the flawed reasoning and inconsistent data handling. Thus, applying this reasoning, the Court finds that Labor's methodology in the instant case also requires reevaluation to meet the substantial evidence threshold.

gold_text: Plaintiff was a support service worker to Allied Signal’s production and therefore was not a production worker himself. Citing Abbott v. Donovan, 6 CIT 92, 570 F. Supp. 41 (1983), Labor argues that service workers such as plaintiff are eligible for certification when (1) their separation is caused by a reduced demand for their services from a production department whose workers independently meet the statutory criteria for certification, and (2) the reduction directly relates to the import-impacted article. Labor points to the overall decrease in military imports to establish that the requirement of increased imports under 19 U.S.C. § 2272(a)(3) could not have been met. Furthermore, even if relevant commercial imports had increased, the [ ] in Allied Signal’s commercial sales would have failed the requirement of decreased sales under 19 U.S.C. § 2272(a)(2). These two factors demonstrate that no independent certification of production workers could have obtained. In addition, the small amount of production diverted to Singapore and the shift in reliance from in-house tool workers to domestic subcontractors reinforce the fact that imports did not contribute importantly to plaintiffs separation.
