In the case of Payne v. Parnell, the court examined whether the use of excessive force by Parnell, a correctional officer, against Payne, a prisoner, violated Payne's Eighth Amendment rights. The court held that the use of an electric cattle prod against Payne was objectively harmful and constituted cruel and unusual punishment.

The court cited cases such as Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1 (1992), and Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312 (1986), which established that the use of force by a prison official must be evaluated in the context of the prison environment and the need for discipline. The court also noted that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment includes an objective component, and that the alleged wrongdoing must be "harmful enough" to establish a constitutional violation.

In this case, the court found that a reasonable jury could conclude that Parnell acted maliciously and sadistically in using the electric cattle prod against Payne, and that the use of force was not justified by any legitimate prison interest. The court also noted that Payne suffered more than de minimis physical injury from the use of force, and that the amount of injury necessary to satisfy the Eighth Amendment's requirements is directly related to the amount of force that is constitutionally permissible under the circumstances.

The court's decision in this case is consistent with the principles established in cases such as Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994), which held that a prison official must be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and that the official must also draw the inference. The court also noted that a failure to act to prevent harm, such as a failure to investigate or supervise, can also violate a prisoner's Eighth Amendment rights.

In conclusion, the court's decision in Payne v. Parnell is consistent with the principles established in cases such as Hudson v. McMillian, Whitley v. Albers, and Farmer v. Brennan, and highlights the importance of evaluating the use of force by prison officials in the context of the prison environment and the need for discipline. The court's decision also underscores the need for prison officials to be aware of facts that may indicate a substantial risk of serious harm and to take steps to prevent harm from occurring.

gold_text: To hold a supervisory official hable for the acts of a subordinate, Payne must show that “(1) the supervisor either failed to supervise or train the subordinate official; (2) a causal link exists between the failure to train or supervise and the violation of the plaintiffs rights; and (3) the failure to train or supervise amounts to deliberate indifference.” Smith v. Brenoettsy, 158 F.3d 908, 911-12 (5th Cir.1998). To state a failure to protect claim under § 1983, Payne must show that he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm and that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his need for protection. Neals v. Norwood, 59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1995). For an official to act with deliberate indifference for purposes of either claim, he “must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).
