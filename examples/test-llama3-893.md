The case at hand involves Beneficial Consumer Discount Co.'s (Beneficial) claim against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for allegedly misleading them into disclosing confidential information. Beneficial is appealing the district court's decision to dismiss its claim, arguing that the Federal Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) and the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waive the IRS's sovereign immunity.

The court held that neither the RFPA nor the FTCA waives the IRS's sovereign immunity. In reference to the RFPA, the court noted that the statute is specifically limited to actions instituted by customers whose rights to financial privacy have been violated. Beneficial, as a financial institution, is not a customer and therefore cannot bring a claim under the RFPA.

Regarding the FTCA, the court found that Beneficial's fraud claim is barred by the statute's misrepresentation and deceit exception. The court cited reference case 2680(h), which preserves the sovereign immunity of the United States with respect to claims "arising out of... misrepresentation [or] deceit."

In conclusion, the court's decision was correct in dismissing Beneficial's claim against the IRS. The RFPA and FTCA do not waive the IRS's sovereign immunity, and Beneficial's fraud claim is barred by the FTCA's misrepresentation and deceit exception.

gold_text: Beneficial at times characterizes the above-quoted claim not only as a fraud claim but also as a claim for contribution or indemnification. The FTCA’s waiver of sovereign immunity normally encompasses claims for contribution or indemnification where the law of the relevant state would hold a private individual liable for contribution or indemnification in the same circumstances. See, e.g., Lockheed Aircraft Co. v. United States, 460 U.S. 190, 196-98, 103 S.Ct. 1033, 1037-38, 74 L.Ed.2d 911 (1983); United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 340 U.S. 543, 546-52, 71 S.Ct. 399, 402-404, 95 L.Ed. 523 (1951). Claims for contribution or indemnity against the government are prohibited, however, when permitting the claims to go forward effectively would defeat the purposes of a particular exception to the government’s waiver of sovereign immunity. See Stencel Aero Eng’g Corp. v. United States, 431 U.S. 666, 673-74, 97 S.Ct. 2054, 2058-59, 52 L.Ed.2d 665 (1977) (private party liable in tort to a military serviceman could not recover from federal government under a contribution or indemnification theory because permitting the claim would defeat the purposes behind the government’s immunity against the serviceman’s direct claim).
