The case at hand, Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Tex. Sys. v. Nippon Tel. & Tel. Corp., 04-1452, involves a dispute between the University of Texas System and Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (NTT) over the ownership of intellectual property rights. NTT appeals the district court's denial of its motion to dismiss the case on the grounds of sovereign immunity.

The court's jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a), which grants jurisdiction over civil actions arising under the patent laws. NTT argues that the district court's jurisdiction is proper because the case raises substantial questions of patent law. However, the court finds that the case does not arise under the patent laws as the claims framed in the complaint assert only causes of action created by state law.

The court also rejects NTT's argument that the case requires the resolution of substantial questions of patent law, citing cases such as U.S. Valves, Inc. v. Dray, 212 F.3d 1368 (Fed.Cir.2000), and Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 822 F.2d 527 (Fed.Cir.1987). These cases establish that issues of inventorship, infringement, validity, and enforceability present substantial questions of federal patent law, but do not apply to the present case.

In contrast, the court finds that the case is similar to American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Integrated Network Corp., 972 F.2d 1321 (Fed.Cir.1992), and Uroplasty, Inc. v. Advanced Uroscience, Inc., 239 F.3d 1277 (Fed.Cir.2001), where the court found that the state law claims did not arise under federal patent law. The court concludes that NTT's appeal is not properly before this court and transfers the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for resolution of the issues raised.

gold_text: In Uroplasty and AT & T, the plaintiffs raised contract and misappropriation claims that implicated U.S. patents, yet we found that resolution of those state law claims were not sufficient to establish jurisdiction under section 1338(a). In the case at hand, the state law claims raised by Plaintiffs are one step farther removed in that they implicate the validity not of a U.S. patent, but of a patent issued under Japanese law. The fact that UT owns a U.S. patent on the invention allegedly misappropriated may be evidence of its claims, but the presence of the patent does not require resolution of a substantial question of U.S. patent law. See Jim Arnold Corp. v. Hydrotech Sys., Inc., 109 F.3d 1567, 1574 (Fed.Cir.1997) (holding that a complaint alleging breach of a patent assignment and royalty agreement does not state a claim arising under the patent laws even though a consequence of finding such a breach may lead to allegations of infringement); Speedco, 853 F.2d at 913 (holding that “the fact that patent issues are relevant under state contract law to the resolution of a contract dispute cannot possibly convert a suit for breach of contract into one ‘arising under’ the patent laws as required to render the jurisdiction of the district court based on section 1338.” (internal citation omitted)); Consol. World Housewares, 831 F.2d at 265 (“the mere presence of a patent issue cannot of itself create a cause of action arising under the patent laws”); Ballard Med. Prod. v. Wright, 823 F.2d 527, 531 (Fed.Cir.1987) (same).
