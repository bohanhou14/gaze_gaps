In the cases of West Texas Shareholders v. Beverly, 476 F.2d 393, and Macmillan, Inc. v. Macmillan, Inc., 565 F.2d 602, it is established that allegations of fraud must be stated with sufficient definiteness to advise the defendant of the claim it must meet. In the case at hand, West Texas Shareholders v. Ryder-Scott Company, the plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient to withstand the defendant’s motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs have stated the time, place, and nature of the alleged fraudulent activities, specifically alleging that Ryder-Scott made representations to them regarding Oiltech’s oil and mineral reserves, which were knowingly false.

The plaintiffs have also identified the specific state statutes allegedly violated, Colorado Revised Statutes sec. 11-51-123 and Nevada Revised Statutes sec. 90.185, and have alleged that the misrepresentations will be found in semiannual reports issued by Ryder-Scott. These allegations are sufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 9(b) and to state a claim for relief under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In contrast to the cases cited by Ryder-Scott, where the allegations of fraud were conclusory and lacked particularity, the allegations in this case are specific and detailed. The plaintiffs have alleged that Ryder-Scott’s representations were made with the intent to induce the plaintiffs to purchase Oiltech stock, and that the company obtained a benefit from the purported fraud. These allegations are sufficient to state a claim for relief under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.

Therefore, the defendant’s motion to dismiss is denied, and the plaintiffs are allowed to proceed with their claims against Ryder-Scott Company.

gold_text: Statements of the time, place and nature of the alleged fraudulent activities must be included in the complaint. Walling v. Beverly Enterprises, 476 F.2d 393, 397 (9th Cir.1973); Bosse v. Crowell, Collier and Macmillan, 565 F.2d 602, 611 (9th Cir.1977). How much additional specificity is required depends on the nature of the individual case. See In re Com. Oil/Tesoro Petroleum Corp. Sec. Lit., supra at 250. In the instant action, Ryder-Scott is a firm of professional engineers whose business success depends to a large extent on its reputation for integrity. Such a situation justifies a greater degree of particularity. See Rich v. Touche Ross & Co., 68 F.R.D. 243, 245 (S.D.N.Y.1975); McFarland v. Memorex Corp., 493 F.Supp. 631, 638 (N.D.Cal.1980). McFarland holds that the plaintiffs should have to specify the misrepresentations, explain in what way they were false, and point out the facts that support an inference of fraud. Id. at 639. The document containing an allegedly fraudulent representation should be identified. Hokama v. E.F. Hutton & Co., Inc., supra at 646. Also, the complaint must be specific as to which state statutes purportedly have been violated by a defendant. Wenzoski v. Citicorp, 480 F.Supp. 1056, 1062 (N.D.Cal.1979).
