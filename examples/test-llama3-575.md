In the case of Haubrich, the district court denied his motions to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing that the court did not abuse its discretion. Haubrich claimed that his counsel was ineffective, and that the district court failed to inform him of the applicable sentencing range and the maximum penalties for certain counts. However, the court found that Haubrich had sufficient time to review the plea agreement and that he had acknowledged the possible punishments at the change-of-plea hearing.

According to reference case 902 F.2d 483, the district court is not required to inform the defendant of the applicable sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines. Similarly, in reference case 27 F.3d 321, the court held that a defendant is not entitled to know the precise sentence he will receive before pleading guilty.

In reference case 877 F.2d 1138, the court found that a defendant's failure to object to counsel's performance at the change-of-plea hearing refutes any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Furthermore, the court held that a defendant's understanding of the possible punishment is sufficient, even if his counsel made other promises.

In Haubrich's case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motions to withdraw his guilty plea. Haubrich had sufficient time to review the plea agreement and acknowledged the possible punishments at the change-of-plea hearing. Additionally, the court's failure to inform Haubrich of the maximum penalties for certain counts did not affect his substantial rights, as he would have received the same sentence regardless. Therefore, the district court's denial of Haubrich's motions to withdraw his guilty plea was affirmed.

gold_text: Haubrich complains the district court erred by failing to address the maximum sentence if he were found to be a career criminal under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1. The Guidelines, however, do not alter the underlying criminal statutes and do not impose a “maximum” or “mandatory minimum” penalty within the meaning of Rule 11(b)(1). See United States v. Salva, 902 F.2d 483, 486-87 (7th Cir.1990). Rule 11 does not require the court to predict the applicable guideline range. Thomas v. United States, 27 F.3d 321, 324 (8th Cir.1994), citing United States v. Fernandez, 877 F.2d 1138, 1143-44 (2d Cir.1989). Even though U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1 may affect the punishment imposed, Rule 11(c)(1) requires only that the district court inform the defendant that it must consider the Guidelines but may depart from them. Haubrich also agreed to be bound by his guilty plea, even if the sentence was more severe than expected.
