 <answer>Here is the written case study based on the provided reference articles:
The case study revolves around the legal proceedings involving two defendants, Matlock and Burkeen, who were charged with bank robbery and related offenses. Matlock initially had privately retained counsel, but later changed his mind and asked to be represented by court-appointed counsel, Mr. Murchison. The district court granted this request, but Matlock later requested to be represented by a different attorney, Mr. Carmack Murchison.

In reference to the case 329 U.S. 173, the court held that a remedy provided by the state must be exhausted in the manner prescribed by the state before seeking relief from the federal courts. In this case, Matlock had the opportunity to be represented by Mr. Murchison, who was appointed by the court to represent both defendants. However, Matlock later requested to be represented by a different attorney, which the court denied.

In reference to the case 350 F.2d 261, the court established that a conflict of interest on the part of counsel representing both defendants may be such as to deprive the accused of the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. However, in this case, the district judge explored carefully the possibility of any conflict of interest between defendants and made an affirmative finding that no such conflict existed.

In conclusion, the court's decision to appoint Mr. Murchison to represent both defendants was not an error. Matlock had the opportunity to be represented by Mr. Murchison, and there was no showing of prejudice against him. The court's decision was in accordance with the principles established in the reference cases, and Matlock's rights under the Sixth Amendment were not violated. <answer>

gold_text: Further, Matlock had the right to represent himself and to insist upon the discharge of his court-appointed counsel. United States v. Johnson, 333 F.2d 1004 (C.A.6). The constitution does not “require that under all circumstances counsel be forced upon a defendant.” Carter v. People of State of Illinois, 329 U.S. 173, 174-175, 67 S.Ct. 216, 218, 91 L.Ed. 172. The record in this case establishes that the district judge was careful and thorough in explaining to Matlock his right to counsel, and that Matlock on his own volition made the deliberate choice to conduct his own defense. This defendant was not without experience in courtroom proceedings. See, e. g., United States v. Burkeen and United States v. Matlock, 350 F.2d 261 (C.A.6). We hold that Matlock’s right to the effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment has not been violated under the facts and circumstances of this case.
