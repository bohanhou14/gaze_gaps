O’Bryan also asserts that his motion to alter or amend the judgment should have been granted based on new evidence showing Dr. Hopkins’ potential bias due to her substantial income from reviewing disability cases. However, the district court's refusal to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e) was not an abuse of discretion, particularly as the evidence about Dr. Hopkins was already available (see reference case 149 F.3d 413). Denials of motions to alter or amend judgments are typically upheld unless new evidence would clearly produce a different outcome, which O’Bryan failed to demonstrate (Bud Brooks Trucking, Inc. v. Bill Hodges Trucking Co., 909 F.2d 1437, 1440 (10th Cir.1990)).

Moreover, O’Bryan's claim of underpayment on salary continuance benefits was similarly dismissed as the evidence did not support his assertions. This lawsuit stands affirmed, mirroring related denials where federal jurisdiction was deemed improper based on the insufficiency of new evidence to alter the prior judgment (reference case 149 F.3d 413). 

For the reasons articulated, including the application of the arbitrary and capricious standard and the absence of a compelling alteration to the factual matrix, we uphold the district court's judgment in favor of the defendants regarding both the denial of long-term disability benefits and the purported miscalculation of salary continuance benefits.

gold_text: O’Bryan also appeals the district court’s denial of his motion to alter or amend based on the evidence submitted concerning Dr. Hopkins. However, the district court properly concluded that this evidence was previously available to O’Bryan, see GenCorp, Inc. v. Am. Int’l Underwriters, 178 F.3d 804, 834 (6th Cir.1999), and would not have produced a different result. See Good v. Ohio Edison Co., 149 F.3d 413, 423 (6th Cir.1998).
