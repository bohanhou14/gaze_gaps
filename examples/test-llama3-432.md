The qualified immunity test asks whether an officer in Templeton's shoes would have known that he was violating the right in question. In this case, a reasonable jury could conclude that Templeton would have understood that the confession he allegedly coerced from Higazy would have been used in a criminal case against Higazy and that his actions therefore violated Higazy's constitutional right to be free from compelled self-incrimination. This is in line with the reasoning in Templeton, 505 F.3d 161.

Regarding the copyright claim, the court held that plaintiffs own a valid copyright in the Design as a matter of law. The court found that the Design meets the low threshold of creativity required by the Copyright Act and that it consists of an "original combination of several elements" even though the individual elements, standing alone, may be unoriginal or part of the public domain. This is in line with the Supreme Court's ruling in Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 477 U.S. 242, which held that copyright protection extends to the original expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves.

In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all justifiable inferences in that party's favor. However, "[i]t is a settled rule that '[credibility assessments, choices between conflicting versions of the events, and the weighing of evidence are matters for the jury, not for the court on a motion for summary judgment.'" Therefore, summary judgment is inappropriate "if there is any evidence in the record that could reasonably support a jury's verdict for the non-moving party."

In this case, the court found that the undisputed evidence supports plaintiffs' version of the facts, and therefore, granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on the issue of ownership of a valid copyright. The court also noted that defendants failed to present any evidence linking the creation of plaintiffs' Design to the public domain, and therefore, their argument that the copyright is not valid because the Design was copied from the public domain is untenable.
