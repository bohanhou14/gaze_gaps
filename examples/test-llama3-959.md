In this case, the court's failure to give advance instructions on the use of statements from a co-conspirator is a crucial issue. The court admitted recordings of conversations between Colon Echevarria, an unindicted co-conspirator, and Alberto Guerrero, a Government informant, which linked each of the appellants to the importation scheme. The court did not provide limiting instructions on the use of these statements, as required by United States v. Honneus, 508 F.2d 566 (1st Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 948, 95 S.Ct. 1677, 44 L.Ed.2d 101 (1975).

However, the court's failure to provide advance instructions did not affect the appellants' substantial rights, as the independent non-hearsay evidence was adequate by any standard. Additionally, Colon Echevarria's later testimony, which implicated the appellants, went over the same ground as his taped remarks and was subject to cross-examination, neutralizing any potential claim of prejudice.

Furthermore, Olivero raises two questions that concern only him. He claims that he should have been tried separately from Rivera Diaz and Cautino Jordan, and that the jury's acquittal of Federico Leearoz Pasarell on the charge of conspiracy requires his acquittal on the same charge. However, the evidence at trial showed a single conspiracy, and Olivero's participation in the distribution aspect of the scheme was directly relevant to his guilt as charged. United States v. Snyder, 505 F.2d 595, 599 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 990, 95 S.Ct. 1433 (1975).

In conclusion, the court's failure to provide advance instructions on the use of statements from a co-conspirator did not affect the appellants' substantial rights, and Olivero's claims of misjoinder and variance were without merit. United States v. Miley, 513 F.2d 1191, 1206-09 (2d Cir. 1975); Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 774, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1252, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946).

gold_text: Two other questions concern only Rivera Diaz and Cautino Jordan. First, they contend that the conspiracies with which they were charged terminated before the time of the conversation between Colon Echevarria and Alberto Guerrero, and that the tape of that conversation should for that reason not have been admitted against them. But, as we have already established, the proof at trial was of a single, ongoing conspiracy to import marihuana and distribute it in Puerto Rico. There was ample evidence that at the time of the taped conversation Colon Echevarria and Olivero at least were still actively engaged in the process of paying off the Colombians from the proceeds of distribution. Since the fruits of the crime were still being divided, the conspiracy was not yet over, e. g., United States v. Iacovetti, 466 F.2d 1147, 1153 (5th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 908, 93 S.Ct. 963, 35 L.Ed.2d 270 (1973); Atkins v. United States, 307 F.2d 937, 940 (9th Cir. 1962), and there was no affirmative showing that either Rivera Diaz or Cautino Jordan had withdrawn, e. g., Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 646, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946).
