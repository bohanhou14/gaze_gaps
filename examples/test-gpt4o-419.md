The district court’s dismissal of Mr. Green’s claims aligns with established precedents regarding in forma pauperis actions and the evaluation of frivolous claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d). In reference case 490 U.S. 319, the dismissal of Williams’s complaint as frivolous due to a lack of substantive claims under Rule 12(b)(6) mirrors the court’s decision here, reinforcing the requirement for specific allegations of rights violations and deliberate indifference (see Williams v. Faulkner, No. IP 86-1307-C, App. 67).

Furthermore, in reference case 828 F.2d 1471, the necessity of demonstrating non-frivolous claims prior to requiring service or an answer is underscored (see Henriksen v. Bentley, 644 F.2d 852, 853-54). The district court’s summary dismissal of Mr. Green’s action as frivolous adheres to this principle, affirming the procedural standards for evaluating pro se inmate complaints. Therefore, the appellate review confirms that Mr. Green’s allegations failed to meet the threshold for Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference and did not substantiate a cognizable claim under § 1983.

gold_text: The district court therefore dismissed the action. The court also noted that it had earlier authorized Mr. Green to commence the action “in forma pauperis under the authority of 28 U.S.C. § 1915. Subsection (e) of that statute permits the dismissal of a case when the court is satisfied that the complaint is without merit in that it lacks an arguable basis either in law or fact.” Op. & Order at 5; R. Vol. 1 at 582 (citing Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); Yellen v. Cooper, 828 F.2d 1471, 1475 (10th Cir.1987)). As indicated above, the court also counted the dismissal as a strike under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).
