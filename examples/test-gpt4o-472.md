WEINFELD, District Judge.
In support of the plaintiff's position, the reference cases elaborate on legal principles pertinent to this case. In 284 U.S. 448, Chief Justice Hughes articulated the importance of adhering to permanent injunctions and the consequences of creating "colorable imitations" to circumvent such decrees. Similarly, in 182 F.2d 604, the court emphasized that actions by individuals affiliated with a corporation cannot be shielded by their nominal separation when their actions serve to violate an injunction benefitting the same corporate interests.

Moreover, in reference case 321 U.S. 671, the dissolution of a corporation for strategic benefits did not absolve it of its legal liabilities, indicating that corporate restructuring or reorganization aimed at evading judicial mandates is impermissible. Finally, the principle from 170 F.2d 783 that corporate entities cannot simply deflect liability through complex inter-corporate relationships complements the plaintiff's argument that the defendant's use of Masters Mail Order House was an attempt to bypass the court's injunction.

These precedents underscore that if a corporation or its affiliates engage in actions that indirectly violate a judicial order, such actions can still be judged as contemptuous. Given these references, the necessity for a comprehensive hearing on the current contempt charges is reinforced.

Settle order on notice.
