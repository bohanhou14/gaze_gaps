**Generation:**

In the present case, appellants argue that their combination of an electrically vibrated trough and photo-electric control for an automatic weighing apparatus constitutes a patentable invention. However, precedent indicates otherwise. In the context of patent law, merely aggregating old elements without producing a novel function does not amount to an inventive step, as affirmed in Byers Machine Co. v. Keystone Driller Co., 294 U.S. 42, where the claims were rejected due to the combination being a mere aggregation of known elements.

Furthermore, as in United States v. Moore, 282 U.S. 375, regulations and treatments by experts in the field hold significant weight. Here, the lower court’s reliance on the French patents to Pasquier and Etablissements, disclosing similar weighing apparatuses with vibrated troughs, affirms that appellants’ device lacks novelty due to known prior art.

Additionally, similar to the case in Rogers, 303 U.S. 545, where diverse elements of lubrication fittings and guns failed to show inventiveness, the appellants’ substitution of an electrically vibrated trough, instead of a motor-operated screw as disclosed in the Rees patent, merely represents an alternative known technique rather than an innovation.

Therefore, combining the photo-electric control, as already established in the Rees patent, with other pre-existing elements does not constitute a patentable invention. The court finds no merit in appellants’ arguments, and thus, the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
