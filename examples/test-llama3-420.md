The Government introduced evidence that Warring’s income was significantly higher than reported, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The Government’s evidence included books and records from Warring’s business, as well as testimony from Revenue Agent Ford and Special Agent Kennedy. The Government’s net worth statement showed that Warring’s net worth increased by $113,185.32 during the period in question, which was attributed to unreported income.

In United States v. Johnson, 319 U.S. 503, the Supreme Court held that the Government may use the net worth method to prove unreported income, provided that the method is reliable and the evidence is sufficient to establish the taxpayer’s net worth. The Government’s net worth statement in this case was prepared using a combination of the cash disbursements method and the net worth method, and was supported by independent evidence of Warring’s income and expenditures.

The Government also introduced evidence of Warring’s suspicious spending habits, including his purchase of a Cadillac car and a number of properties. In United States v. Smith, 348 U.S. 147, the Supreme Court held that the Government may use evidence of suspicious spending habits to corroborate its net worth statement, provided that the evidence is reliable and sufficient to support the taxpayer’s guilt.

In conclusion, the Government presented sufficient evidence to support its allegations of tax evasion, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The Government’s evidence included books and records from Warring’s business, as well as testimony from Revenue Agent Ford and Special Agent Kennedy. The Government’s net worth statement was prepared using a combination of the cash disbursements method and the net worth method, and was supported by independent evidence of Warring’s income and expenditures. Additionally, the Government introduced evidence of Warring’s suspicious spending habits, which was corroborated by the net worth statement.
