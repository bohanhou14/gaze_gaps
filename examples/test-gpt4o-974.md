The District Court’s determination of the restitution amount aligns with legal precedents, particularly in its approach to calculating actual losses suffered by the victim. As noted in United States v. Quillen, restitution must be confined to "an amount pegged to the actual losses suffered by the victims of the defendant’s criminal conduct” (335 F.3d 219). The Court correctly focused on the unrecovered losses from the unenforced leases directly linked to Fallon’s fraud.

Moreover, the District Court adhered to the legal framework established in United States v. Vitillo, where it is emphasized that restitution should only include losses directly resulting from the defendant's conduct, and such findings should be based on a preponderance of the evidence (490 F.3d 314). The Court's methodology of crediting the default minimal residual value of the machines ($2,500 each) adheres to this principle since Fallon did not provide sufficient evidence to counter the presumption that these values reflected ABL’s actual losses.

In conclusion, the District Court’s restitution order appropriately reflects the losses causally linked to Fallon’s fraudulent actions. The Court’s deductions for the residual value of the machines and its decision to exclude potential mitigating factors not substantiated by evidence further uphold the standards mandated by the MVRA and relevant case law.
