In determining whether appellee Dunn exercised reasonable diligence during the critical period, it is instructive to consider similar doctrines as outlined in reference cases. In reference case 290 F. 311, the court emphasized the requirement of perseverance and reasonable diligence under the circumstances. Wayne's diligence in reducing his invention to practice despite financial difficulties was examined meticulously. Dunn's similar delay in advancing his peeling turret could be analogized to Wayne's persistent effort despite external challenges.

Furthermore, the court in reference case 295 F. 931 approved Joy's strategy of waiting until his invention reached commercial viability before filing, as it demonstrated due diligence in refining the invention. However, Joy's case contrasted with Dunn’s, as Joy was ultimately commended for ensuring his invention's readiness before approaching the Patent Office. Dunn’s focus on the peeling mechanism, absent from the counts in issue, mirrors Joy's caution but also deviates in that Dunn's progress on this unrelated aspect does not constitute necessary diligence toward reducing the subject matter at hand to practice.

Therefore, applying the guidance from these reference cases, it is evident that Dunn's work on an unrelated peeling mechanism does not satisfy the requirement of continuous diligence in reducing the invention in question to practice. Thus, appellant Thompson, having first reduced the invention to practice, meets the diligence requirement more directly and is entitled to priority.
