The case at hand is a complex one, involving a dispute over a settlement agreement between Dr. Waksberg and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agreement was contingent upon Dr. Waksberg signing a pre-trial diversion settlement, known as the Brooklyn Plan, which was ultimately not signed.

In order to determine whether the Government's position was substantially justified, we must consider the evidence presented in the case. As stated in Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988), the Government's position is substantially justified if it is "justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person." In this case, the Government's failure to provide Dr. Waksberg with a copy of the agreement and its continued reimbursement of Dr. Waksberg's services despite the lack of a signed agreement, as mentioned in Reference case 891 F.2d 323, demonstrate a lack of justification for its position.

Furthermore, the Government's conduct in this case can be seen as a breach of its obligations under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). As stated in 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), the Government is required to pay the prevailing party's fees and expenses unless it can demonstrate that its position was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust. In this case, the Government's failure to provide Dr. Waksberg with a copy of the agreement and its continued reimbursement of Dr. Waksberg's services despite the lack of a signed agreement demonstrate a lack of justification for its position.

In conclusion, the Government's position in this case was not substantially justified, and Dr. Waksberg is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses under the EAJA. The Court finds that the Government's conduct in this case was a breach of its obligations under the EAJA, and that Dr. Waksberg's attorneys worked 1,226.2 hours on this case at an adjusted rate of $124.36 per hour, resulting in an award of attorneys' fees of $152,490.23.

gold_text: This Circuit has affirmed the award of paralegal fees under the EAJA. See Oklahoma Aerotronics, Inc. v. United States, 943 F.2d at 1352 (upholding award of paralegal time as “expenses”); Raton Gas Transmission Co. v. F.E.R.C., 891 F.2d 323, 329 n. 75 (D.C.Cir.1989) (approving of reasonable compensation for legal assistants such as paralegals). In analyzing another fee-shifting statute, the Supreme Court viewed it as “self-evident” that a statutory “ ‘reasonable attorney’s fee’ ... should compensate the work of paralegals.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274, 285, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 2470, 105 L.Ed.2d 229 (1989) (interpreting 42 U.S.C. § 1988). Whether the award under the EAJA is justified as a “reasonable attorney fee” or a necessary “project” expense, see § 2412(d)(2)(A), Dr. Waksberg shall be reimbursed for paralegal work in the amount of $19,923.90.
