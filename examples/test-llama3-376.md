The district court did not commit reversible error in granting the motion to sever the claims of the seven other plaintiffs from the civil action against the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The court's decision to sever was based on the fact that each plaintiff's claims were distinct and separate, and that there was no common issues of fact or law that would require a joint trial.

The court's decision was supported by the reference case of T.D.S. Inc. v. Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., 760 F.2d 1520, 1535 (11th Cir.1985), which held that a district court's decision not to order separate trials is not disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. The court also considered the reference case of Harris Corp. v. Nat'l Iranian Radio & Television, 691 F.2d 1344, 1353 n. 18 (11th Cir.1982), which held that objections to personal jurisdiction are generally waivable.

Furthermore, the court's decision to sever was also supported by the reference case of Hollis Barron, et al. v. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 328 F.3d 1291, which held that a district court's decision to grant a motion to sever is not reversible error absent an abuse of discretion. The court in that case also noted that the decision to sever was based on the fact that each plaintiff's claims were distinct and separate, and that there was no common issues of fact or law that would require a joint trial.

In conclusion, the district court did not commit reversible error in granting the motion to sever the claims of the seven other plaintiffs from the civil action against the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The court's decision was supported by the reference cases of T.D.S. Inc. v. Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., 760 F.2d 1520, 1535 (11th Cir.1985), Harris Corp. v. Nat'l Iranian Radio & Television, 691 F.2d 1344, 1353 n. 18 (11th Cir.1982), and Hollis Barron, et al. v. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 328 F.3d 1291. The court's decision was based on the fact that each plaintiff's claims were distinct and separate, and that there was no common issues of fact or law that would require a joint trial.

gold_text: Ordinarily, we review a district court’s grant of a motion to sever for an abuse of discretion. See Bailey v. Board of County Comm’rs of Alachua County, Fla., 956 F.2d 1112, 1128 (11th Cir.1992). When a party fails to raise an argument or issue below, we generally deem the issue to be waived. See e.g., Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, 377 F.3d at 1168-69. Nevertheless, we may review an issue or argument not raised below when: (1) it involves “a pure question of law if the refusal to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice”; (2) the objection is not raised in the court below because “the appellant had no opportunity to raise the objection”; (3) “there is at stake a substantial interest of justice”; (4) “the proper resolution is beyond any doubt”; and (5) “if the issue presents significant questions of general impact or great public concern.” In re Worldwide Web Systems, Inc., 328 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.2003).
