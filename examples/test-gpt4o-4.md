In considering the objections to the magistrate's report, it is crucial to reference the Federal Magistrate’s Act, 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), which has been extensively interpreted in several cases. As highlighted in 616 F.2d 603 and 678 F.2d 376, any party may serve and file written objections to the magistrate's proposed findings and recommendations within ten days, allowing a judge to make a de novo determination of contested portions.

In the case at hand, the magistrate directed that objections should be filed within ten days, paralleling the procedure noted in 474 U.S. 140, where failure to file timely objections can result in waiver of the right to appeal. Despite the potential for review sua sponte by the district judge, as occurred in 474 U.S. 140, such a provision underscores the importance of adhering to procedural rules.

Therefore, in alignment with judicial precedents (616 F.2d 603, 678 F.2d 376, 474 U.S. 140), this court adopts the magistrate’s report and recommendations. Consequently, the claims in Count I are adequately detailed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), and further discovery will entail a comprehensive review post-pretrial, ensuring due process and judicial economy.

Report and recommendation of the magistrate is adopted.
