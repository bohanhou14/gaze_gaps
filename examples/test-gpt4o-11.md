However, the inherent conflict of interest should not automatically nullify the deference usually afforded to the plan administrator's decision. In evaluating the impact of such a conflict, it is essential to weigh it alongside other factors, as outlined in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn. The conflict "acts as a tiebreaker when the other factors are closely balanced" (564 F.3d 856). It becomes significant when there's a "higher likelihood" that it affected the decision, especially in cases with a demonstrated history of biased claims administration.

In this context, the decision of whether an amendment to the plan that curtailed Marrs’s benefits was reasonable falls under the administrator's interpretive discretion. As reiterated by the Supreme Court in Firestone, deference is warranted as long as the interpretation is not "arbitrary and capricious." This principle balances the plan administrator's discretion while acknowledging potential conflicts, aligning with Glenn's nuanced approach (576 F.3d 240).

The careful scrutiny over conflicts of interest does not imply outright dismissal of the administrator's decision but rather a contextual assessment of its reasonableness, particularly when the plan confers such discretion (560 F.3d 620). This approach ensures that plan administrators' decisions hold, provided they exhibit reasonable grounds (504 F.3d 665). Consequently, while acknowledging possible bias, the administrator's interpretation of the amendment in Marrs's case stands as reasonable and is thus upheld (855 F.2d 394).

gold_text: There are two ways to read the majority opinion. One, which tracks its language and has been echoed in opinions in this and other circuits, e.g., Jenkins v. Price Waterhouse Long Term Disability Plan, 564 F.3d 856, 861-62 (7th Cir.2009); Holland v. Int’l Paper Co. Retirement Plan, 576 F.3d 240, 246-49 (5th Cir.2009), makes the existence of a conflict of interest one factor out of many in determining reasonableness. That sounds like a balancing test in which unweighted factors mysteriously are weighed. Such a test is not conducive to providing guidance to courts or plan administrators. “Multifactor tests with no weight assigned to any factor are bad enough from the standpoint of providing an objective basis for a judicial decision; multifactor tests when none of the factors is concrete are worse.” Menard, Inc. v. Commissioner, 560 F.3d 620, 622-23 (7th Cir.2009) (citations omitted); see also Sullivan v. William A. Randolph, Inc., 504 F.3d 665, 671 (7th Cir.2007); Short v. Belleville Shoe Mfg. Co., 908 F.2d 1385, 1394 (7th Cir.1990) (concurring opin ion); Stevens v. Tillman, 855 F.2d 394, 399-400 (7th Cir.1988).
