Punitive Damages
In addressing the applicability of punitive damages under Indiana’s wrongful death statute, we find guidance in precedents that discuss statutory interpretation and the limitations on recovery based on legislative intent.

In particular, reference case 441 U.S. 347 emphasizes the principle that legislative classifications must bear a rational relation to a legitimate state interest. Here, the legislative intent behind the wrongful death statute is primarily compensatory, aimed at covering pecuniary losses without extending to punitive damages.

Additionally, reference case 440 U.S. 93 underscores the legislative process and the role of amendments. The inclusion of "including but not limited to" in the statute does not imply an expansion to punitive damages but rather clarifies the broad range of compensatory considerations, aligning with the statute's compensatory aim.

The rationale for limiting damages, as affirmed in reference case 501 F.2d 1145, supports restrictive policies on damage recovery to avoid speculative and excessive claims. This aligns with Indiana’s historical approach, which has not traditionally permitted punitive damages in wrongful death actions for the reasons stated.

Therefore, we conclude that Ind. Code Ann. § 34-1-1-2, even as amended, does not authorize punitive damages, reinforcing the statute's compensatory focus.

Based on this interpretation, the district court correctly withheld punitive damages from the jury's consideration.

For these reasons, we affirm the lower court’s judgment while ensuring the remand conditions are met for reassessing the admissibility of the decedent’s statements.

CONCLUSION
The judgment of the district court excluding punitive damages is AFFIRMED. The case is REMANDED for the determination of the decedent’s mental competence regarding the admission of his hearsay statement.

gold_text: Plaintiff alternatively contends that if § 34-1-1-2 does not allow punitive damages it violates the equal protection clauses of the United States and Indiana Constitutions by discriminating against wrongful death claimants and in favor of other personal injury and property damage plaintiffs, who are permitted to recover punitive damages. This contention is without merit. The legislative classification, involving neither race nor ‘certain other immutable human attributes,” does not constitute invidious discrimination. See Parham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347, 351, 99 S.Ct. 1742, 1745, 60 L.Ed.2d 269 (1979). Nor does it affect fundamental rights. See id. at 1749 n.12. Therefore § 34-1-1-2 “is entitled to a presumption of validity and will be upheld ‘unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legislative purposes that we can only conclude that the legislature’s actions were irrational.’ ” Id. at 1746 (quoting Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97, 99 S.Ct. 939, 943, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979)). Plaintiff has not persuaded us that the adoption of § 34 — 1-1-2 without a provision authorizing awards of punitive damages was irrational. See Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 110-111, 99 S.Ct. 939, 950, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979). We agree with the First Circuit’s holding that such a provision does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Cyr v. B. Of fen & Co., 501 F.2d 1145, 1148-1149 n.2 (1974).
