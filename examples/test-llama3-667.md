In the case of Kennedy v. Rose, the defendant appeals the denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the admission of out-of-court statements of his alleged accomplices and polygraph evidence violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment. The defendant claims that the statements were inadmissible hearsay and that the polygraph evidence was unreliable and not properly admitted.

The court holds that the admission of the out-of-court statements was proper as the defendant adopted them as his own, citing Allen v. United States, 372 U.S. 293 (1963). The court also finds that the admission of polygraph evidence was proper, citing State v. Souel, 53 Ohio St.2d 123, 372 N.E.2d 1318 (1978), which allows the results of a polygraphic examination to be admissible in evidence for purposes of corroboration or impeachment.

The court rejects the defendant's claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to call the alleged accomplices to testify, citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). The court finds that counsel's decision was based on trial tactics and was not ineffective assistance of counsel.

In conclusion, the court holds that the admission of the out-of-court statements and polygraph evidence was proper, and that the defendant's counsel was effective. The petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.

gold_text: The state court post-conviction proceeding provided appellant with a hearing at which the material facts were developed and the merits of the factual dispute were resolved. No new evidence was presented to the District Court or to this Court. The hearing provided in the state court was a full and fair hearing. No further hearing on the issue of the effective assistance of counsel is required. See Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 312-13, 83 S.Ct. 745, 756-57, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963) (standards for when a hearing in federal court reviewing a petition for habeas corpus from state court conviction is required). Moreover, the determination by the state court is presumed to be correct in a federal habeas court unless this Court determines the record as a whole does not support the factual determination or appellant proves by clear and convincing evidence that the factual determination was erroneous. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d); Sumner v. Mata, 449 U.S. 539, 545, 101 S.Ct. 764, 768, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981).
