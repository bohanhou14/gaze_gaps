D. Dr. Reid’s Testimony Was Consistent With the Requirements and Precedents Under Rule 803(4).

In evaluating whether Dr. Reid’s testimony about the minor’s statements was admissible, it is pertinent to consider the standards set forth in Rule 803(4), which admits statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment. Rule 803(4) eliminates the traditional distinction between statements made for diagnosis and those made solely for treatment (Reference case 846 F.2d 941). 

Dr. Reid’s dual role, both to treat the minor and to gather evidence, does not detract from the admissibility. This is supported by the precedent in the referenced cases, demonstrating that statements made for diagnosis, regardless of whether the clinician is also preparing for testimony, are admissible (Reference cases 846 F.2d 941, 633 F.2d 77). The minor’s statements to Dr. Reid were pertinent to both diagnosis and treatment and came from a young patient seeking help, satisfying the dual rationale test for admissibility established in Reference case 633 F.2d 77.

Furthermore, Dr. Reid’s reliance on the minor's statements, given her experience in treating child abuse victims, underscores the reasonable dependence that medical professionals place on such declarations for appropriate diagnosis and treatment (633 F.2d 77). Thus, there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in allowing Dr. Reid’s testimony under Rule 803(4).

For the aforementioned reasons and relevant precedents provided, the trial court's decision to admit Dr. Reid's testimony is affirmed.
