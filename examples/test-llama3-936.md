The appeal challenges the allowances of counsel fees and costs incurred by the trustee in defending against the appellant's counterclaim and cross-bill in the suit to construe the trust provisions of the Eddy will. The District Court's judgment is also attacked as it makes the disbursements of the trustee a charge upon the dividends of shares of stock eventually to be turned over to the appellant.

The doctrine of res judicata applies in this case as the District Court's decree of February 7, 1939, sustained against the appellant in Van Auken v. Second Nat'l Bank & Trust Co., 6 Cir., 117 F.2d 1009, specifically provided that the disbursements of the trustee, both for expenses and the fees of counsel, should be reported to the court and when allowed be made a charge upon the dividends of the appellant's share in the trust estate. Reference case 307 U.S. 161 supports the principle of res judicata, stating that in cases where a trustee has been brought into court by a cestui que trust upon charges of maladministration which have proved to be unfounded, costs 'as between solicitor and client' have been allowed the trustee, though there has been no fund in court.

Additionally, the doctrine of estoppel applies as the appellant had failed in all phases of the litigation, and the principle of estoppel would apply in the fullest force if the questions decided in the first suit were not here res adjudicata. Reference case 105 U.S. 527 supports the doctrine of estoppel, stating that in cases where a fund has been realized by the diligence of the plaintiff, a simple-contract creditor who recovers a fund for the general benefit is allowed his costs, as between party and-party, out of the fund in preference to all other claims.

In conclusion, the allowance of extraordinary fees and other costs in the District Court must be sustained on the principle of res judicata and estoppel. The doctrine of res judicata applies as the District Court's decree of February 7, 1939, sustained against the appellant, and the doctrine of estoppel applies as the appellant had failed in all phases of the litigation.

gold_text: Though not on the ground of res judicata, the power to grant costs as between solicitor and client in respect to costs on appeal must also be recognized as residing in the District Court, subject, of course, to review as to their actuality and reasonableness. As was said of such costs in Sprague v. Taconic Bank, supra [307 U.S. 161, 59 S.Ct. 781] “They are not of a routine character like ordinary taxable costs; they are contingent upon the exigencies of equitable litigation, the final disposition of which in its entire process including appeal places such a claim in much better perspective than it would have at an earlier stage.” The inquiry is a collateral one, having a distinct and independent character. Trustees v. Greenough, 105 U.S. 527, 26 L.Ed. 1157.
