As a further basis for this Court’s decision, the extreme measure of default judgment, while severe, must be balanced against the potential misuse of judicial resources and the necessity of maintaining judicial efficiency. In National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639, the Supreme Court emphasized that dismissals and severe sanctions are justified where a party's conduct demonstrates a flagrant disregard for court orders. Similar sentiments were echoed in Pease v. Peters, 550 F.2d 698 (1st Cir. 1977) and Affanato v. Merrill Brothers, 547 F.2d 138.

Additionally, the persistent failure and last-minute attempts to rectify non-compliance, as seen in 665 F.2d 410, illustrates the abuse of the discovery process where delays hinder judicial proceedings. The issuance of repeated compliance orders and the ultimate enforcement by sanction in 628 F.2d 652 further supports this Court's decision.

Moreover, recognizing that while defaults are a drastic remedy, the necessity of ensuring compliance with discovery obligations cannot be understated. This is reinforced in the precedent of 535 F.2d 148, which highlights due process concerns and the necessity of proportionate sanctions to address non-compliance effectively.

Given these precedents, the Court’s chosen sanctions are proportionate, aiming to uphold judicial efficiency while ensuring compliance with Court orders, without resorting to the most extreme measure of default judgment.
