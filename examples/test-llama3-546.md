The case at hand involves Conservative Baptist Association of America (CBAA) suing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for alleged religious discrimination against two chaplains, Dan Klender and Steve Firtko. CBAA claims that it has standing to bring this lawsuit, but the court disagrees.

To establish standing, an organization must show injury-in-fact, causation, and redressability. In Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992), the Court established that an organization must demonstrate these three elements to establish standing. CBAA fails to meet these requirements.

CBAA claims that it has an injury-in-fact because VA's alleged actions have caused it to reconsider its endorsement of chaplains for the CPE program. However, this is a speculative claim and does not rise to the level of an injury-in-fact. In Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v. Eschenbach, 469 F.3d 129, 132-33 (D.C.Cir.2006), the Court held that an organization must show a concrete and demonstrable injury to its activities, not just a hypothetical future harm.

Furthermore, CBAA lacks associational standing because Firtko and Klender are not members of CBAA. In Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), the Court held that an association must show that at least one of its members would have standing to sue in his own right. CBAA fails to meet this requirement because Firtko and Klender are not members of CBAA.

In conclusion, CBAA lacks standing to bring this lawsuit because it fails to demonstrate injury-in-fact and associational standing. Therefore, the court grants VA's motion to dismiss.

Norton, 434 F.3d 584, 590 (D.C.Cir.2006) (“In order to establish standing, [the association] must demonstrate, as to each of its claims, that at least one member meets the requirements of Lujan.”). To determine whether an individual is a member of an organization, the Court looks to whether that individual possesses the “indicia” of membership, which include electing the leadership of the association, guiding the association’s activities, and financing those activities. See Am. Legal Found., 808 F.2d at 91 (holding that “media watchdog” organization that purported to act on behalf of television viewers lacked associational standing because the viewers did not select leadership, guide activities, or finance activities); see also Fund Democracy, LLC v. SEC, 278 F.3d 21, 26-27 (D.C.Cir.2002) (holding that plaintiff organization that purported to act on behalf of an “informal consortium” of mutual fund investors lacked associational standing because it was not steered by its purported members and did not receive funding from such members); Gettman v. DEA, 290 F.3d 430, 435 (D.C.Cir.2002) (holding that magazine that purported to act on behalf of readers and subscribers lacked associational standing because those readers and subscribers did not select leadership, guide activities, or finance activities).
