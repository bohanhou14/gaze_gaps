The Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (Fund) filed a suit against Ralph's Grocery Company (Company) for delinquent pension contributions. The Company argued that it was not required to make contributions for severance pay received by its employees. The Fund contended that the Company's collective bargaining agreement with the Union required it to make such contributions.

The court held that the Company was required to make contributions for severance pay. The court relied on the standard clause in the collective bargaining agreement, which stated that the Company would make payments to the Fund for each hour or portion thereof, for which an employee, subject to the Collective Bargaining Agreement, receives pay.

The court also rejected the Company's argument that the Fund's severance pay policy was invalid because it conflicted with the Company's collective bargaining agreement. The court held that the policy was consistent with the standard clause and did not conflict with the collective bargaining agreement.

Finally, the court rejected the Company's argument that the Fund was equitably estopped from pursuing its claim. The court held that equitable estoppel was not available to modify the written terms of an ERISA plan in the context of a participant's suit for benefits.

In reaching its decision, the court cited several cases, including Central Pennsylvania Teamsters Pension Fund v. McCormick Dray Line, 85 F.3d 1098 (3d Cir. 1996), which held that a multiemployer fund can enforce the literal terms of an employer's commitment, even if the employer and union had not explicitly agreed to those terms. The court also cited Benson v. Brower's Moving & Storage, Inc., 907 F.2d 310 (2d Cir. 1990), which held that a fund can recover delinquent contributions from an employer even if the employer had not explicitly agreed to make those contributions.

In conclusion, the court held that the Company was required to make contributions for severance pay received by its employees, and that the Fund was not equitably estopped from pursuing its claim. The court's decision was based on the standard clause in the collective bargaining agreement and the policies of the Fund. The decision was consistent with several cases, including Central Pennsylvania Teamsters Pension Fund v. McCormick Dray Line, 85 F.3d 1098 (3d Cir. 1996), and Benson v. Brower's Moving & Storage, Inc., 907

gold_text: Equitable estoppel “arises when one party has made a misleading representation to another party and the other has reasonably relied to his detriment on that representation.” Black v. TIC Investment Carp., 900 F.2d 112, 115 (7th Cir.1990). Reliance on the misrepresentation is reasonable only if the party asserting estoppel does not or should not know the truth. Heckler v. Community Health Services of Crawford County, Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 59-60 n. 10, 104 S.Ct. 2218, 2223-24 n. 10, 81 L.Ed.2d 42 (1984) (“If, at the time when he acted, such party had knowledge of the truth, or had the means by which with reasonable diligence he could acquire the knowledge so that it would be negligence on his part to remain ignorant by not using those means, he cannot claim to have been misled by relying upon the representation or concealment.”); see also Cannon v. Group Health Service of Oklahoma, Inc., 77 F.3d 1270, 1276-77 (10th Cir.1996) (listing common law elements of equitable estoppel).
