In the context of legal cases, the exclusionary rule serves as a crucial tool in ensuring that evidence obtained through illegal means is not used in court. In the case of 371 U.S. 471, the Supreme Court held that evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search or seizure may not be used in court, even if the evidence itself is otherwise admissible.

In the case of 344 F.3d 623, the court addressed the issue of whether a consent to search a motel room was valid despite being granted during an unlawful arrest. The court held that even if the consent was voluntary, the evidence obtained as a result of the search may still be suppressed if it was obtained as a result of an illegal seizure.

In the context of the case at hand, it is clear that the arrest of Gerry Griffith, Jr. was unlawful. The evidence presented did not demonstrate probable cause to believe that Griffith had committed the crime of attempted abduction. The statements made by Wilcox, a school security officer, were based on hearsay and did not provide sufficient evidence to support a belief that Griffith had used force or threats.

As a result, the evidence obtained during the search of Griffith's house, including the firearm and drugs, must be suppressed. The exclusionary rule requires that evidence obtained as a result of an illegal arrest be excluded from court, even if the evidence itself is otherwise admissible.

In conclusion, the court's decision to deny Griffith's motion to suppress the evidence was in error. Given the unlawful arrest and the lack of probable cause, the evidence obtained during the search of Griffith's house must be suppressed. The case should be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

gold_text: Arguing that his arrest was illegal, however, does not immediately entitle Griffith to suppression of the gun and drugs, because they were found in a search conducted pursuant to his consent. In order to be entitled to suppression, he must also demonstrate that the search, although consensual, was nonetheless the ‘fruit’ of the allegedly-illegal arrest within the meaning of Wong Sun v.
