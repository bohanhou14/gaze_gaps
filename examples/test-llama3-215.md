The court's decision to grant summary judgment on the plaintiff's claims of ancestry and age discrimination is well-reasoned. The plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, as required by law. In particular, the plaintiff did not provide evidence that his position was not eliminated after his discharge, which is an essential element of a prima facie case of discrimination.

Furthermore, the court correctly noted that the plaintiff's claims of ancestry and age discrimination were based on thin evidence and lacked any concrete evidence of discrimination. The court's decision to grant summary judgment on these claims is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966), which held that a federal court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims where the federal claims have been dismissed before trial.

In this case, the plaintiff's federal claims of ancestry and age discrimination were dismissed before trial, and the court correctly exercised its discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim of retaliatory discharge. The court's decision is also consistent with the Tenth Circuit's decision in Ball v. Renner, 54 F.3d 664 (1995), which held that a federal court should consider the propriety of exercising supplemental jurisdiction "in each case, and at every stage of the litigation."

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant summary judgment on the plaintiff's claims of ancestry and age discrimination was well-reasoned and consistent with established legal precedent. The court's decision to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim of retaliatory discharge was also consistent with the law and the facts of the case. Reference cases: 383 U.S. 715, 124 F.3d 1221.

gold_text: Having granted summary judgment on all claims over which this court has original jurisdiction, the court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction on the plaintiffs state law claims against the defendant. 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3); United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 725-26, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966) (“[I]f the federal claims are dismissed before trial, ... the state claims should be dismissed as well.”). When the federal claims have dropped from the case, the seminal teaching of Gibbs is that the most common response is to dismiss the state law claims without prejudice. Roe v. Cheyenne Mountain Conference Resort, Inc., 124 F.3d 1221, 1237 (10th Cir.1997). The parties do not argue any unique circumstances, and the court finds none, that would justify exercising supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs state law claims against the defendant.
