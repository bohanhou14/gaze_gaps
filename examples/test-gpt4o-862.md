**Generation:**

In analyzing the materiality requirement, we turn to the precedents established in referenced cases 842 F.3d 103 and 356 U.S. 595. As established in the former, the mere knowledge of allegations does not equate to knowledge of actual noncompliance. This principle underscores that a government's continuous payment despite awareness of certain violations strongly suggests that such violations were not material (842 F.3d 103). In 356 U.S. 595, the Court clarified that payment of claims against the government only occurs when there is an actual liability; thus, for the government to deny a claim on the grounds of noncompliance, the noncompliance must be a significant factor influencing the payment decision.

Applying this logic, Petratos’s failure to demonstrate that CMS would have refused to pay the claims, even if fully aware of the alleged noncompliance, undermines the materiality argument. Consequently, without evidence of the government's payment decisions being directly influenced by the purported misrepresentations, Petratos's allegations cannot satisfy the False Claims Act’s materiality criterion. Therefore, the District Court's judgment to dismiss the case is affirmed based on the lack of materiality.

PAE Gov’t Servs., Inc., 670 Fed.Appx. 126, 127 (4th Cir. 2016) (“The relevant question is whether the defendant knowingly violated a requirement that the defendant knows is material to the government’s decision to pay a claim.”); United States ex rel. Escobar v. Universal Health Servs., Inc., 842 F.3d 103, 109 (1st Cir. 2016) (“In order for False Claims Liability to attach, these misleading omissions must be material to the government’s decision to pay the claim.”); United States v. Sanford-Brown, Ltd., 840 F.3d 445, 447 (7th Cir. 2016) (dismissing claim where there was “no evidence that the government’s decision to pay [the claim] would likely or actually have been different had it known of [the violation]”). Besides, it would make little practical sense to give the doctors’ materiality determinations dispositive weight. Because the False Claims Act was passed to protect the federal treasury, United States v. McNinch, 356 U.S. 595, 599, 78 S.Ct. 950, 2 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1958), and since the Government decides on payment, Universal Health Servs., 136 S.Ct. at 1996, it is the Government’s materiality decision that ultimately matters.
