In Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, the Supreme Court emphasized the jurisdictional nature of statutory time limits for filing notices of appeal, stating that failing to comply with such time limits results in a lack of jurisdiction. This principle is directly applicable here, as Ms. Lemus's filing missed the 90-day deadline mandated by § 3796c-2.

Additionally, the statutory language in § 3796c-2 mirrors that found in other provisions deemed jurisdictional by the Court. Specifically, it uses the phrase “unless notice of appeal is filed (within the time specified herein and in the manner prescribed for appeal to United States courts of appeals from United States district courts)”—an indication of Congress's intent for this provision to be jurisdictional, as seen in Des Moines Nav. & R. Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co., 123 U.S. 552, and reaffirmed in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 12, referenced in 540 U.S. 443.

Given this clear indication of Congressional intent and consistent judicial interpretation, we conclude that the 90-day deadline within § 3796c-2 is jurisdictional. Therefore, Ms. Lemus's untimely filing warrants dismissal of her appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, the government's motion to dismiss is granted.

gold_text: The statute goes beyond merely specifying what procedural steps must be taken to appeal. By its terms, § 3796c-2 speaks to our authority to hear a PSOBA appeal by establishing a “built-in time constraint.” See Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 453, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004). Moreover, § 3796c-2 uses language similar to 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a) — the statute governing appeals from district court civil proceedings, which has long been held jurisdictional. See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (noting that § 2107 “contains the type of statutory time constraints that would limit a court’s jurisdiction”).
