**Generation:**

Mr. Monroe asserts that he did not unambiguously waive his right to pursue a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3582(c)(2), referencing United States v. Williams, 102 F.3d 923, where the court emphasized interpreting plea agreements according to their plain meaning. Additionally, courts should draft plea agreements with due process concerns in mind (Williams, 102 F.3d at 927).

The claim that the waiver in Monroe's plea agreement constituted a general relinquishment of the right to seek sentence modification does not align with principles outlined in United States v. Bowler, 585 F.2d 851, which emphasizes specific performance of plea agreements and remedies for breaches. Similarly, the case of United States v. Rourke, 74 F.3d 802, illustrates the necessity for courts to examine the specific terms and understandings of the plea agreements involved.

Ultimately, our determination aligns with United States v. Poole, 550 F.3d 676. Hence, Monroe's motion for a sentence reduction is ineligible since it was based on a statutory minimum, not a sentencing range amended under U.S.S.G. Amendment 706.
