In the case of Susan L. Carney, Circuit Judge, the doctrine of equitable mootness was applied to dismiss the appeals of the Appellants as equitably moot. The Appellants, who held unused consumer gift cards issued by Borders, the now-defunct retail bookstore chain, sought to vacate a May 28, 2013 judgment of the District Court dismissing their challenges to three Bankruptcy Court orders.

The Bankruptcy Court found that the Plan was substantially consummated, and denied the motions of the Appellants to file untimely proofs of claim and to certify a class of all holders of Borders gift cards issued prepetition. The District Court accepted the Bankruptcy Court's determination and found that the Appellants' appeals were equitably moot. The Court held that the doctrine of equitable mootness applies in the context of Chapter 11 liquidation proceedings, and that the Appellants failed to satisfy the five Chateaugay factors, which include ensuring adequate process for parties who would be adversely affected and demonstrating their own diligence in obtaining a stay.

In reference to the case of Suter, 504 F.3d 987, the Court noted that the doctrine of equitable mootness is grounded in the notion that with the passage of time after a judgment in equity and implementation of that judgment, effective relief on appeal becomes impractical, imprudent, and therefore inequitable. In the case of FritoLay, Inc. v. LTV Steel Co. (In re Chateaugay Corp.), 10 F.3d 944, the Court held that the doctrine of equitable mootness applies in the context of Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings, and that the Appellants failed to satisfy the five Chateaugay factors.

In conclusion, the Court's decision to dismiss the appeals as equitably moot was proper, and the doctrine of equitable mootness was correctly applied. The Appellants failed to satisfy the five Chateaugay factors, and the passage of time after the confirmation of the Plan made it impractical, imprudent, and inequitable to grant relief on their appeals.
