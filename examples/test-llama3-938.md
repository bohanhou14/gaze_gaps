Considering the legal cases provided, I can assist you in answering your question. The cases reference error standards in habeas corpus proceedings, specifically the Kotteakos v. United States (328 U.S. 750) and Brecht v. Abrahamson (507 U.S. 619) standards.

In the context of habeas corpus proceedings, the Kotteakos standard requires that the error have resulted in "actual prejudice," meaning "had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict." This standard is less onerous than the Chapman standard, which requires a showing of "harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."

The Brecht court held that the Kotteakos standard is better tailored to the nature and purpose of collateral review than the Chapman standard. The court concluded that applying a less onerous harmless-error standard on habeas promotes the considerations underlying habeas jurisprudence.

In the case of a condemned prisoner seeking habeas corpus relief, the court must determine whether the error had a "substantial and injurious effect in determining the jury's verdict." This standard is more forgiving than the Chapman standard, which requires a showing of "harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."

In summary, the Kotteakos standard is used in habeas corpus proceedings, which requires a showing of "actual prejudice." This standard is less onerous than the Chapman standard and is better suited for collateral review. The Brecht court held that applying the Kotteakos standard promotes the considerations underlying habeas jurisprudence.
