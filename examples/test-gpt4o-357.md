The district court's rejection of Uribe's argument aligns with precedent. In United States v. Vargas-Duran, 319 F.3d 194, the court upheld a 16-level enhancement for intoxication assault, noting that the Texas crime involves the use of force. Similarly, in United States v. Rodriguez, 323 F.3d 317, the court recognized that certain non-enumerated crimes still meet the criteria for a "crime of violence" under § 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) due to their inherent risk of using physical force.

In Uribe's case, his conviction for assault with intent to inflict serious injury qualifies as a "crime of violence" under U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) because it involves the use or threatened use of physical force. Despite not being enumerated in the guideline's commentary, the dangerous nature of Uribe's crime satisfies the definition of a "crime of violence" as elucidated in prior cases.

Thus, we find no error in the district court's application of the 16-level enhancement, and Uribe’s arguments do not warrant a different outcome. We AFFIRM the sentence imposed by the district court.

For these reasons, the district court did not err in applying the enhancement, and the sentence is affirmed.

gold_text: However, Uribe acknowledges that his state-court conviction was for an assault that constitutes an “aggravated felony” for the purposes of the sentencing guidelines because the term of incarceration was for more than one year. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43). In addition, the nature of Uribe’s state-court offense was an aggravated assault, which satisfies both subsections (I) and (II) of the guideline’s definition of a “crime of violence.” United States v. Vargas-Duran, 319 F.3d 194, 196 (5th Cir.2003); United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 323 F.3d 317, 318 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the district court was correct in applying a 16-level increase to Uribe’s base offense level.
