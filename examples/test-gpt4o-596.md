In determining whether Homelands should be liable for the tax debts of Caremost under the theory of corporate nominee/alter ego, this Court must first decide whether to apply the state law standard or the federal standard. The seminal case of Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979) establishes that “property interests are created and defined by state law,” and, unless a federal interest necessitates a different result, state law governs the analysis of property rights. Following this reasoning, it is appropriate to apply Florida law to the question of piercing the corporate veil since Homelands is a Florida corporation.

Under Florida law, as established in Dania Jai-Alai Palace, Inc. v. Sykes, 450 So. 2d 1114 (Fla. 1984), piercing the corporate veil requires a showing of improper conduct or fraud. The Florida Supreme Court has emphasized that the corporate veil may only be pierced where it is proven that the corporation was organized or misused for an improper purpose, such as misleading creditors or perpetrating fraud. This requirement is echoed in Hillsborough Holdings Corp. v. The Celotex Corp. (In re Hillsborough Holdings Corp.), 166 B.R. 461, 468 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1994), which further defined the stringent standards necessary for piercing the corporate veil in Florida.

Conversely, the federal standard, as articulated in G.M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338 (1977) and more specifically in the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in Shades Ridge Holding Co., Inc. v. United States, 888 F.2d 725 (11th Cir. 1989), does not require a showing of fraud but focuses on control and misuse of corporate assets.

Based on the evidence provided, there is substantial intermingling of funds and a lack of adherence to corporate formalities, factors that typically support piercing the corporate veil. However, applying the Florida standard, which necessitates a showing of improper conduct or fraud, and given Judge Paskay’s interpretation in Hillsborough Holdings that fraud is required to pierce the veil, this Court must examine if such proof exists in the case of Homelands.

Thus, under Florida law, the burden is on the IRS to demonstrate that Homelands was used to perpetrate improper conduct or fraud to justify holding it liable for Caremost’s tax debts.

gold_text: The court in In re Arizona Dep’t. of Revenue (In re Blanton), 105 B.R. 811, 821 (Bankr.W.D.Tex.1989) made a good point when it stated that “determination of whether the corporate veil should be pierced is a determination of the property attributes of stock ownership and of the relationship between a stockholder/director and his corporation. Such determinations are made by application of state, not federal law.” citing Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d 136 (1979).
