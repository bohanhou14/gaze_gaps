In the context of the antitrust laws, standing refers to the ability of a plaintiff to bring a lawsuit. To have standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate an injury to their business or property interest. The courts have consistently interpreted the phrase "business or property" to refer to commercial interests or enterprises.

In the case of Billy Baxter, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 471 F.2d 727, the court held that a plaintiff must show a causal connection between an antitrust violation and an injury sufficient to establish the violation as a substantial factor in the occurrence of damage. The court also noted that the plaintiff must be engaged in activities intended to be protected by the antitrust laws.

In Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, the Supreme Court held that a state has standing to sue under the antitrust laws, but only as a parens patriae on behalf of its citizens, and not as a representative of its own proprietary interests.

In Reibert v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 518 F.2d 1129, the court held that a plaintiff must demonstrate a competitive injury to have standing under the antitrust laws.

In Conference of Studio Unions v. Loew's, Inc., 193 F.2d 51, the court held that a plaintiff must show a direct injury to their business or property interest to have standing under the antitrust laws.

In this case, the consumers do not have standing to sue under the antitrust laws because they do not have a business or property interest that has been directly injured by the alleged antitrust violations. The farmworkers, on the other hand, may have standing under section 16 of the Clayton Act, but their claims for treble damages under section 4 were dismissed. If the farmworkers are seeking injunctive relief, they must demonstrate a threat of injury or damage from future violations of the antitrust laws. Without a demonstration of irreparable injury, injunctive relief will not lie.

gold_text: Section 16 deletes any requirement that a plaintiff be injured in his business or property in order to state a cause of action for antitrust violations. However, the plaintiff must show, among other things, “threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws.” 15 U.S.C. § 26 (emphasis added). This language requires a showing that the alleged significant threat of injury was proximately caused by the violations. See, e. g., Reibert v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 471 F.2d 727 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 938, 93 S.Ct. 1900, 36 L.Ed.2d 399 (1973). Those courts which have found causation lacking for injunctive relief have often spoken in terms of the remoteness of the injury from the allegedly violative activity. See, e. g., Jeffrey v. Southwestern Bell, 518 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir. 1975); Conference of Studio Unions v. Loew’s, Inc., 193 F.2d 51 (9th Cir. 1951), cert. denied, 342 U.S. 919, 72 S.Ct. 367, 96 L.Ed. 687 (1952).
