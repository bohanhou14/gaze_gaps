In addressing whether the debtor will suffer undue hardship, it is essential to incorporate the precedent established in prior rulings. For instance, the court previously identified a series of factors for evaluating undue hardship, such as the debtor’s rate of pay, skills, ability to retain employment, educational level, health, and expenses (Reference case 95 B.R. 376, In re Lisanti). Applying these factors here, it is evident that the debtor’s income, although limited, does exceed the poverty threshold, and there are no indications of significant barriers to maintaining or potentially improving her employment situation. Moreover, the debtor does not suffer from any physical or mental condition that would impair her ability to work.

Regarding the good faith test, the debtor must demonstrate efforts towards repayment or renegotiation of the loan (Reference case 89 B.R. 744, In re Conner). Despite the financial strain, there is no record of substantive attempts by the debtor to renegotiate the repayment terms, which casts doubt on her commitment to fulfilling her obligations.

In sum, under the established framework and considering the debtor’s financial profile, the court finds that the criteria for proving undue hardship are not met. Consequently, the debt remains non-dischargeable, and the court denies the request for attorney fees due to public policy considerations (Miller v. Kyle).

Judgment will be entered accordingly, affirming the nondischargeability of the student loan.
