Finally, similar to the issues identified in the administrative law judge’s handling of Sarchet’s case, see 78 F.3d 305, where the judge made several unfounded sociological speculations and misunderstood expert testimony, the ALJ in McGee’s case also made critical errors. The ALJ misinterpreted the vocational expert’s testimony and failed to properly address the substantial medical evidence supporting the plaintiff’s ailments. Additionally, as seen in Zurawski’s case, 245 F.3d 881, where the ALJ failed to provide specific reasons for the credibility determination, in McGee's case, the ALJ similarly neglected to build a logical bridge from the evidence to his conclusions, inadequately explaining the inconsistencies between McGee’s reported symptoms and the medical findings. This warrants a remand to ensure compliance with SSA regulations and proper evaluation of the plaintiff's claims.

gold_text: . It is true that the ALJ, later in his opinion, provided some additional reasons for the credibility determination, but none can withstand scrutiny. First, the ALJ noted that plaintiff worked only sporadically prior to the alleged disability onset, got fired from her last job, and hadn’t recently looked for work. (Tr. at 17.) However, in a case such as this, where the claimant alleges disability based in large part on chronic conditions (rather than some traumatic injury), employment history may mean little absent further evaluation as to why the work record is limited. See Sarchet v. Chater, 78 F.3d 305, 308 (7th Cir.1996) (rejecting the ALJ’s reliance on poor work history where the claimant had long suffered from numerous impairments rendering her unemployable). The ALJ also ignored plaintiff’s testimony that she was fired from her last job because she "was acting bipolar” (Tr. at 50), and that she had not applied for jobs because of her emotional problems (Tr. at 51). Second, the ALJ stated that plaintiff’s "daily activities were not limited to the extent one would expect, given the complaints of disabling symptoms and limitations.” (Tr. at 17.) However, the activities he listed — making meals, trying to do some chores around the house, attending church, going to a casino, and doing laundry with some assistance — are hardly impressive in considering the ability to work full-time outside the home. See, e.g., Mendez v. Barnhart, 439 F.3d 360, 362 (7th Cir.2006) (cautioning the SSA against placing undue weight on a claimant's household activities in assessing her ability to work as the pressures, the nature of the work, flexibility in the use of time, and other aspects of the working environment often differ dramatically between home and office or factory or other place of paid work); Carradine, 360 F.3d at 755 (reversing where the ALJ failed to "consider the difference between a person's being able to engage in sporadic physical activities and her being able to work eight hours a day five consecutive days of the week”); Zurawski v. Halter, 245 F.3d 881, 887 (7th Cir.2001) (reversing where the ALJ relied on fairly restricted activities and failed to explain how such activities were inconsistent with the claimant’s complaints of pain); see also Moss, 555 F.3d at 562 ("An ALJ cannot disregard a claimant’s limitations in performing household activities.”). Finally, the ALJ noted plaintiff's ability to care for five children at home. (Tr. at 17.) However, the record shows that by the time of the hearing most of plaintiff’s children were grown (Tr. at 42, noting their ages as 22, 21, 19, 17, 15, and 5), and the older children helped plaintiff care for the younger ones (Tr. at 85-86, 102-03.) The record also contains evidence that plaintiff gave one child up for adoption and lost her other children to child protective services in 2002. (Tr. at 288.) In any event, the Seventh Circuit has rejected the notion that a claimant's ability to care for her children means she can work outside the home. See Gentle v. Barnhart, 430 F.3d 865, 867 (7th Cir.2005).
