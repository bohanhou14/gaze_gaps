**Generation:**

Under the doctrine of equivalents, infringement can occur even if the accused product does not literally infringe the patent claims, provided that there is equivalence between the elements of the accused product and the claimed elements of the patented invention (Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605, 609). This doctrine recognizes that minor changes which do not literally fall within the express terms of the claims may still be deemed infringing if the substituted elements perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result (Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., 520 U.S. 17, 35-36).

In the present case, Plaintiff contends that the Innerloc™ broadhead infringes the ’868 patent under the doctrine of equivalents. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that the Innerloc™ broadhead performs substantially the same function (i.e., securing the blades within the arrowhead body), in substantially the same way (i.e., using a closure mechanism and slots), to achieve substantially the same result (i.e., a fully assembled broadhead with securely positioned blades).

However, for the doctrine of equivalents to apply, the substitute element must not perform a role that is substantially different from the claimed element (Tronzo v. Biomet, Inc., 156 F.3d 1154, 1160). Here, Defendant argues that each blade of the Innerloc™ broadhead is individually inserted and secured by the tip structure, unlike the described “blade assembly” in the ’868 patent which is constructed and arranged to be inserted as a unit.

Given these arguments, there is a question of whether the differences in assembly create a substantially different role. If the inner workings and assembly steps of Innerloc™ indeed vitiate the claim limitations of the ’868 patent, then there can be no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as a matter of law (Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., 520 U.S. 17, 29-30; Tronzo v. Biomet, Inc., 156 F.3d 1154, 1160).

In conclusion, the differences highlighted by Defendants could preclude the application of the doctrine of equivalents. Therefore, Plaintiff must demonstrate that the functional, way, and result aspects substantially overlap with the limitations specified in the ’868 patent to withstand Defendants' motion for summary judgment.

Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605, 70 S.Ct. 854, 94 L.Ed. 1097 (1950), the United States Supreme Court “set out the modern contours of what is known in patent law as the ‘doctrine of equivalents.’ ” Warner-Jenkinson Co., Inc. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., 520 U.S. 17, 21, 117 S.Ct. 1040, 137 L.Ed.2d 146 (1997). “Under this doctrine, a product or process that does not literally infringe upon the express terms of a patent claim may nonetheless be found to infringe if there is ‘equivalence’ between the elements of the accused product or process and the claimed elements of the patented invention.” (Id.) (citing Graver Tank, 339 U.S. at 609, 70 S.Ct. 854). “An accused device may infringe under the doctrine of equivalents only if it possesses all of the limitations of the relevant claim either literally or equivalently.” Tronzo v. Biomet, Inc., 156 F.3d 1154, 1160 (Fed.Cir.1998) (citing Warner-Jenkinson, 520 U.S. at 40, 117 S.Ct. 1040). “Whether an element of the accused device is equivalent to a claim limitation depends on ‘whether the substitute element matches the function, way, and result of the claimed element, or whether the substitute element plays a role substantially different from the claimed element.’ ” Id. (quoting Warner-Jenkinson, 520 U.S. at 40, 117 S.Ct. 1040).
