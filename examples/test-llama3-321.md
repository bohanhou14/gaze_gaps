The cases of 595 F.2d 890 and 386 U.S. 171 provide valuable insights into the legal framework of labor disputes. In the case of 595 F.2d 890, the court held that a union's decision to settle a grievance without arbitration was not per se unreasonable, as long as it was made in good faith and not arbitrary or discriminatory. This case highlights the importance of the duty of fair representation, which requires unions to act in good faith and not to discriminate against any member.

In the case of 386 U.S. 171, the court held that a union's breach of its duty of fair representation could be remedied through judicial enforcement. This case emphasizes the importance of the duty of fair representation and the need for unions to act in good faith and not to discriminate against any member. It also highlights the need for judicial enforcement of the duty of fair representation.

In the present case, the union's decision to settle the grievance without arbitration was made in good faith and not arbitrary or discriminatory. The union's decision was based on a careful consideration of the interests of all parties involved, including the employer, the employees, and the union itself. The union's decision was not motivated by hostility towards teachers, as suggested by the appellants. Rather, it was motivated by a desire to protect the interests of all parties involved and to find a solution that was fair and reasonable.

In conclusion, the cases of 595 F.2d 890 and 386 U.S. 171 provide valuable insights into the legal framework of labor disputes. The duty of fair representation is an essential part of this framework, and unions must act in good faith and not discriminate against any member. In the present case, the union's decision to settle the grievance without arbitration was made in good faith and not arbitrary or discriminatory, and it was therefore reasonable and appropriate.

gold_text: One final issue is whether summary judgment should have issued before plaintiffs’ interrogatories, seeking information about the extent of investigation of the grievances by the Council, were answered. Wholly apart from the conclusory nature of plaintiffs’ argument that such information would be significant, appellants never sought to invoke Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f). They did not file an affidavit to obtain a continuance to undertake needed discovery nor did' they in any way indicate that lack of discovery was an issue. They cannot now raise it for the first time. Johnston v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 595 F.2d 890 (1st Cir. 1979). Because we find no genuine issue as to unfair representation, summary judgment also was appropriate in favor of the employer, Greyhound. Vaca v.
