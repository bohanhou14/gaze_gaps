The district court based its decision on a detailed review of the legislative history and statutory language, correctly interpreting the intent of Congress with respect to the term "eligible." It found the Secretary's interpretation, substituting "entitled" for "eligible," to be contrary to the plain text and underlying purpose of the statute. As noted in precedent cases, the judiciary must reject administrative constructions that contradict clear congressional intent (97 F.3d 1261). Furthermore, the policy considerations of the bankruptcy code, though in a different context, teach us that granting a double benefit or an unintended advantage must be avoided, to ensure equity among claimants (83 F.3d 1041). Applying similar reasoning here, accepting the Secretary’s interpretation would grant a de facto double reduction in payment obligations for the hospital's unpaid services, which is not sanctioned by the statute or its legislative history (19 F.3d 270).

Therefore, we affirm the district court's interpretation that hospital days need not be paid by Medicaid to be counted in the Medicaid proxy for the DSH calculation. The statutory language clearly supports the hospitals' position that eligibility for Medicaid is the crucial factor, not actual receipt of payment. Accordingly, the Secretary must recalibrate the DSH payments to include days of patients who are Medicaid-eligible, regardless of capped payments by state plans.

gold_text: Three sister circuits agree with us. The Ninth, Eighth and Sixth Circuits all hold that the Secretary’s interpretation of the Medicaid proxy does not comply with congressional intent as expressed in the statute and is therefore impermissible. Legacy Emanuel Hosp. & Health Center v. Shalala, 97 F.3d 1261 (9th Cir.1996); Deaconess Health Servs. Corp. v. Shalala, 83 F.3d 1041 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (affirming 912 F.Supp. 438 (E.D.Mo.1995)); Jewish Hosp., Inc. v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 19 F.3d 270 (6th Cir.1994). In sum, “[w]e believe the language of the Medicare reimbursement provision is clear: the Medicaid proxy includes all patient days for which a person was eligible for Medicaid benefits, whether or not Medicaid actually paid for those days of service.” Legacy Emanuel Hosp., 97 F.3d at 1265.
