Our decision aligns with the principles established in existing jurisprudence regarding state and federal oversight of national banks. In 199 U.S. 148, the definition of "visitorial powers" was clarified as pertaining primarily to ecclesiastical and eleemosynary institutions, where federal authority prevails through judicial avenues. This is similarly observed in our context where the Comptroller of the Currency exercises such authority, precluding state oversight.

Additionally, in 591 F.2d 182, it was established that federal jurisdiction, if necessary for an overarching investigation, takes precedence. Analogously, the enforcement of anti-redlining statutes against national banks, which involves nuanced financial risks assessment, underlines the necessity for exclusive federal oversight to ensure uniformity and efficiency.

Therefore, we find that enforcement of the anti-redlining provisions should rest exclusively with federal authorities, specifically the Comptroller of the Currency, to prevent redundancy and uphold coherent regulatory practices. Thus, while state legislation addresses a significant concern, its enforcement mechanisms must yield to federal jurisdiction to maintain the efficacy and integrity of national banking operations.

gold_text: It is not clear just what “visitorial” powers include, although generally they do encompass examination of the bank’s books and records. A few notable exceptions are that a stockholder of the bank may inspect its records to determine the value of the stock, Guthrie v. Harkness, 199 U.S. 148, 157-59, 26 S.Ct. 4, 7, 50 L.Ed. 130 (1905), and the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission likewise may investigate bank records for matters within those agencies’ purview, Peoples Bank of Danville v. Williams, 449 F.Supp. 254, 158-60 (D.Va.1978); FTC v. Rockefeller, 441 F.Supp. 234, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 1977), aff’d, 591 F.2d 182 (2d Cir. 1979). Enforcement of the antiredlining statute no doubt would require examination of bank records. We need not meet the Comptroller’s interpretative ruling in all respects but, in the circumstances of this case, exclusivity of the power to examine is a reasonable interpretation of the National Bank Act.
