Both Calloway and Sander also challenge the district court's determination of the drug quantities attributable to each of them for sentencing purposes. In Calloway's case, the court attributed the drugs found in his possession and the amount he sold to the confidential informant. This is similar to the findings in the case referenced in 171 F.3d 195, where the court affirmed the attribution of at least 1.5 kilograms of crack to the defendant based on purchases, sales, and witnessed transactions. Here, the evidence establishes that Calloway possessed 143.1 grams of crack, sold 1.9 grams to the informant, and was involved in multiple transactions, which supports the district court's determination.

Regarding Sander, the court's attribution of all the drugs found with Calloway was based on her admitted conspiracy to distribute more than fifty grams of crack, her frequent purchases from Calloway, and her involvement in trips to obtain drugs. This approach is consistent with the rationale in 987 F.2d 1009, where the failure to establish a specific quantity did not affect the base offense level if the total quantity fell within the guideline's range. Here, Sander's involvement in distributing substantial amounts of crack aligns with the conspiracy charges and supports the court's quantity determination.

In conclusion, based on the references to these cases and the factual findings, we find no clear error in sentencing determinations relating to drug quantities attributable to Calloway and Sander. Therefore, we affirm the district court's judgment.

The district court’s determination of the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant for sentencing purposes is a factual question reviewed for clear error. United States v. Randall, 171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999). A defendant involved in a conspiracy is responsible for all reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of their jointly undertaken criminal activity, USSG § lB1.3(a)(l)(B), unless those acts are beyond the scope of the defendant’s agreement.
