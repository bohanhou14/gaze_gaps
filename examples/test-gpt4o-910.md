Drawing from the precedents in reference cases, the bankruptcy court recognized certain conditions under which equitable subordination can be applied without the prerequisite of a fiduciary relationship. For instance, in 106 B.R. 971, the court held that the lender was subject to fiduciary obligations once it exerted dominion and control over the debtor, demonstrating that control, not fiduciary status, was the criterion. Similarly, in 109 B.R. 216, the court emphasized that equitable subordination does not necessitate a fiduciary relationship but requires proving unjust conduct by the creditor that results in injury to other creditors.

Considering the principles in reference case 80 B.R. 247, equitable subordination requires a trustee's clear demonstration of a creditor's inequitable conduct. In the instant case, the trustee has failed to provide specific allegations of such significant misconduct by Chase, as needed for a non-fiduciary party. Following this rationale, the court's dismissal of the equitable subordination claim aligns with the precedent, as substantial evidence of egregious conduct is absent.

Therefore, in light of these authoritative cases, I uphold the bankruptcy court’s decision to dismiss the equitable subordination claim, as the stringent requirements for non-insiders have not been satisfied by the trustee.
