The discretion of prosecutors in choosing to pursue federal charges over state charges is well-established and broad, allowing them significant latitude in such decisions. As noted in United States v. Allen, 954 F.2d 1160, "[s]o long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the decision of whether or not to prosecute and what charge to file ... generally rests entirely in his discretion.” This discretion means that selecting federal charges against Carthen, resulting in a guideline range of 77-96 months compared to a lesser state guideline, is not improper or arbitrary.

In United States v. Gale, 468 F.3d 929, the court emphasized that a prosecutor's discretion to choose between a substantive offense or a sentence enhancement must be respected unless there is shown to be a clear violation of established rights. Furthermore, as demonstrated in United States v. Bolden, 479 F.3d 455, prosecutors have the authority to influence sentences significantly based on the charges they pursue, reinforcing the appropriateness of Carthen’s federal prosecution.

Lastly, Carthen’s arguments regarding the substantive reasonableness of his 96-month sentence and the choice of federal prosecution fail to show any improper use of discretion that would justify overturning the district court's decision. The higher federal sentence is a product of sound prosecutorial judgment, affirming the public safety and appropriate allocation of law enforcement resources as noted in Carthen’s case.

The district court's sentence and the decision to prosecute Carthen federally are affirmed.

Allen, 954 F.2d 1160, 1166 (6th Cir.1992). When a prosecutor has probable cause to believe that an accused has committed an offense defined by statute, “decisions regarding whether to prosecute and what charges to file generally rest within the prosecutor’s discretion.” United States v. Brimite, 102 Fed.Appx. 952, 955 (6th Cir.2004) (unpublished opinion); see also Allen, 954 F.2d at 1166. The baseline for judging selective prosecutions is whether decisions to file and pursue charges were based on a defendant’s race, sex, religion, or exercise of a statutory or constitutional right. Allen, 954 F.2d at 1166.
