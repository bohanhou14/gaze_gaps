**Generation:**

In light of the Ninth Circuit's rulings, it is clear that the court's reasoning in Cantrell's case aligns with previous decisions, particularly those elucidated in the reference cases.

In **Ragsdale**, the court explicitly stated that California partners are trustees over the assets of the partnership (106 B.R. 649 at 796-97). This designation as trustees places partners under the fiduciary definition within the meaning of § 523(a)(4). Conversely, the **Hultquist** decision highlighted that corporate officers are not considered trustees of corporate assets, thus not falling under the fiduciary category per § 523(a)(4) (101 B.R. 180).

Applying these precedents, the BAP rightly determined that Cantrell, as a corporate officer, was not a fiduciary within the statutory trust context detailed under § 523(a)(4). Cal-Micro's assertion that Cantrell breached fiduciary duties does not hold under California law, which distinguishes between mere fiduciary duty and the higher threshold of trust required by § 523(a)(4). Thus, aligning with the findings in Ragsdale and Hultquist, Cantrell’s debts are dischargeable because he did not meet the fiduciary criteria as a corporate officer.

Therefore, the case is correctly summarized: it adheres to the interpretation that corporate fiduciaries do not equate to trustees under § 523(a)(4), affirming the BAP's decision.

gold_text: . Indeed, in Roots v. Bangerter (In re Bangerter), 106 B.R. 649, 654 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.1989), the court concluded that "California law does not hold that a majority shareholder is a trustee of the corporate assets or any interests that shareholders may have in the corporate res.” As a result, the court held that a minority shareholder could not maintain a § 523(a)(4) cause of action against a majority shareholder. While In re Bangerter addressed the status of a controlling shareholder, the court recognized that whether an officer is a fiduciary under § 523(a)(4) represented a similar issue and cited approvingly to Alexander & Alexander of Washington, Inc. v. Hultquist (In re Hultquist), 101 B.R. 180 (9th Cir. BAP 1989).
