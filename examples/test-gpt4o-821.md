The Ninth Circuit in Watkins, 875 F.2d 699, emphasized that estoppel against the government requires more than mere negligence; there must be an "affirmative misrepresentation or affirmative concealment of a material fact by the government" (944 F.2d 603). Bolt's contention of estoppel fails as no affirmative misconduct is evident—merely an oversight by the NPS, which does not rise to the required level of affirmative misconduct (922 F.2d 1402).

Moreover, the court has consistently rejected estoppel claims without a pervasive pattern of false promises or highly egregious conduct (911 F.2d 324). Affirmative misconduct is strictly delineated as requiring more than isolated misstatements (904 F.2d 1335).

In conclusion, in the absence of affirmative misrepresentation or concealment, the APUC's argument for estoppel does not hold, as the government's conduct does not meet the stringent criteria established in precedents such as Watkins and reinforced across multiple decisions (913 F.2d 1382). Therefore, the DoD's motion for summary judgment is further supported in this context.
