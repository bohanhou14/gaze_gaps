The case at hand, Monk v. Birmingham, raises important questions about the constitutionality of zoning laws that restrict the right of Negro citizens to occupy property in white residential areas. The court has previously ruled in cases such as Buchanan v. Warley (245 U.S. 60, 38 S.Ct. 16, 62 L.Ed. 149) and Harmon v. Tyler (273 U.S. 668, 47 S.Ct. 471, 71 L.Ed. 831) that such laws are violative of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law.

In this case, the court finds that the zoning laws in question, which prohibit Negro citizens from occupying property in white residential areas, are unconstitutional and void. The court notes that the laws are not based on any legitimate public interest or policy, but rather on racial discrimination. The court also finds that the laws deny Negro citizens the right to occupy, enjoy, and dispose of their property solely because of their race, which is a violation of their constitutional rights.

The court cites several reference cases in support of its decision, including Shelley v. Kraemer (334 U.S. 1, 11, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161), which held that restrictive covenants in property deeds that prohibited the sale or rental of property to Negroes were unconstitutional. The court also cites City of Richmond v. Dean (281 U.S. 704, 50 S.Ct. 407, 74 L.Ed. 1128), which held that a city ordinance that prohibited Negroes from occupying property in white residential areas was unconstitutional.

In conclusion, the court finds that the zoning laws in question are unconstitutional and void, and that Negro citizens have the right to occupy, enjoy, and dispose of their property without discrimination based on race. The court's decision is consistent with previous cases that have held that racial discrimination in property rights is unconstitutional and violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.

gold_text: In Buchanan v. Warley, supra, the Supreme Court in considering an ordinance of the City of Louisville, Which it held to be unconstitutional, said that Colored persons have the right to- purchase property and enjoy and use the same without laws discriminating against them solely on account of color. In an effort to avoid the impact of this decision appellants insist that the Buchanan case involved the right to dispose of property and not, as in the case at bar, the right of occupancy. The Supreme Court of Louisiana, in considering an ordinance of the City of New Orleans in the case of Tyler v. Harmon, 158 La. 439, 104 So. 200, 205, also attempted to' distinguish the Buchanan case on the same ground and found that the underlying reasons which prompted the Supreme Court to hold the ordinance of the City of Louisville unconstitutional were not pertinent to the ordinance of the City of New Orleans because there was nothing in the New Orleans ordinance forbidding “a white man to sell his property to a colored man, or forbidding a colored man to sell to a white man” in any community or neighborhood. On that basis, the Supreme Court of Louisiana held the ordinance of the City of New Orleans valid in so far as it forbad Negro tenants to occupy defendant’s cottages in a white community. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed, finding the citation of Buchanan v. Warley, supra, sufficient to support -its judgment. Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U.S. 668, 47 S.Ct. 471, 71 L.Ed. 831. The principle established in these cases was thereafter followed in City of Richmond v. Dean, 4 Cir., 37 F.2d 712; affirmed 281 U.S. 704, 50 S.Ct. 407, 74 L.Ed. 1128. And in the recent case of Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 11, 68 S. Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161, the Supreme Court in considering restrictions on the right of occupancy which had been created by private agreements again stated that legislation imposing restrictions on the right of occupancy solely because of color cannot be squared with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.
