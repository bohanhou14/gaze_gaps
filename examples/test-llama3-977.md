In the context of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, the question arises as to whether the exclusivity provisions of the Act apply to retaliatory discharge claims. In this regard, the case of 417 F.2d 1030 is instructive. The court held that the exclusivity provisions of the Act apply to retaliatory discharge claims, and that the claimant must exploit the administrative remedy provided by the Act rather than invoking state law.

Similarly, in 395 U.S. 352, the Supreme Court held that the OCSLA adopts the laws of the adjacent State, but only to the extent that they are applicable and not inconsistent with federal laws. This provision was intended to supplement the federal law and provide a remedy for workers who might otherwise be without a remedy.

In the present case, the claimant argues that the exclusivity provisions of the OCSLA do not apply to retaliatory discharge claims, and that the claimant has a right to invoke state law. However, the court has held that the exclusivity provisions of the Act do apply to retaliatory discharge claims, and that the claimant must exploit the administrative remedy provided by the Act rather than invoking state law.

Therefore, the court concludes that the exclusivity provisions of the OCSLA do apply to retaliatory discharge claims, and that the claimant must exploit the administrative remedy provided by the Act rather than invoking state law. This decision is consistent with the holding in 417 F.2d 1030 and 395 U.S. 352.
