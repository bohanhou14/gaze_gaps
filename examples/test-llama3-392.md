In the case of Ivanov v. INS, the court must determine whether Dimitar Ivanov is eligible for asylum and withholding of deportation. The BIA denied Ivanov's applications, finding that his credibility was undermined by material discrepancies in his testimony and the lack of corroboration from other evidence.

The court notes that to qualify for asylum, Ivanov must show that he is a refugee, unable or unwilling to return to his native country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. The court references case 154 F.3d 719, where the court held that "an applicant for asylum must show more than mere membership in a group that, assuming arguendo, is subject to some level of persecution. [The applicant] must also show that [he] is more likely than other members of the group to be persecuted."

The court finds that the evidence presented by Ivanov does not establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The court references case 105 F.3d 374, where the court held that "generalized conditions of strife do not'show that [Tamas] himself will be singled out for persecution on account of one of the enumerated grounds'." Ivanov's claims of persecution are based on his involvement in the UMO Ilinden, but his testimony is inconsistent and lacks corroboration.

The court also notes that the BIA's decision was supported by substantial evidence, and that the court cannot second-guess the BIA's adverse credibility determination. The court references case 222 F.3d 417, where the court held that "without a concrete explanation other than the language difficulty for the discrepancies, [the court must] accept the BIA's adverse credibility determination."

In conclusion, the court denies Ivanov's applications for asylum and withholding of deportation, finding that his credibility was undermined by material discrepancies in his testimony and the lack of corroboration from other evidence. The court relies on the principles established in cases 154 F.3d 719, 105 F.3d 374, and 222 F.3d 417 to support its decision.

gold_text: Ivanov’s failure to credibly establish past persecution also undermines his argument of a well-founded fear of future persecution. If an alien establishes past persecution, there is a rebuttable presumption that he also has a well-founded fear of future persecution and therefore should be granted asylum. See 8 C.F.R. § 208(b); see also Asani v. INS, 154 F.3d 719, 722 (7th Cir.1998). But the reverse also often holds true: “Because the asylum laws assume that the past is often prologue to the future, petitioners’ failure to show past persecution, without more, bodes poorly for their attempt to show a well-founded fear of persecution.” Marquez v. INS, 105 F.3d 374, 380 (7th Cir. 1997). This is particularly true when evidence shows that conditions in the home country have changed so dramatically as to undermine the well-foundedness of that fear. Id. In denying eligibility, the IJ relied on an advisory opinion from the BHRHA concluding that country conditions in Bulgaria “have so altered as to remove the presumption that past mistreatment in the Communist years will lead to mistreatment in the future.” Indeed, the 1999 U.S. Country Report on Bulgaria observes that “[t]here were no reports of any prosecutions for simple membership in [UMO Ilinden].” We have recognized State Department reports as authoritative sources on the current political situation in foreign states and, therefore, helpful in determining whether an asylum applicant’s fear of future persecution is well-founded. See Tamas-Mercea v. Reno, 222 F.3d 417, 423 (7th Cir.2000). Ivanov offered no equally credible source of information to rebut the State Department’s assessment of the likelihood of persecution under the current regime.
