This case presents a unique situation where a prisoner, Newkirk, was transferred from a medium-security facility to a maximum-security facility without being given due process. The district court held that Newkirk's transfer violated his due process rights and ordered the prison officials to provide him with notice and a hearing before any future transfers. The court also ordered the officials to inform Newkirk of the scope of permissible behavior at the facility and the circumstances that would warrant his transfer.

In our view, the district court's decision is consistent with the principles set forth in reference cases such as 416 U.S. 115, which held that a prisoner has a due process right to notice and a hearing before a transfer. The court's decision also follows the logic of cases like 312 U.S. 270, which emphasized the importance of providing prisoners with notice and a hearing in order to ensure that they are treated fairly and without arbitrary discrimination.

Furthermore, the district court's decision is consistent with the language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that no state shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." In this case, the state deprived Newkirk of his liberty by transferring him to a maximum-security facility without providing him with due process. This deprivation was arbitrary and unjustified, and it violated Newkirk's due process rights.

In conclusion, the district court's decision is consistent with the principles of due process and the language of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court's decision provides a clear and concise statement of the rights of prisoners and the obligations of prison officials to provide them with due process.

gold_text: We find no merit in appellants’ additional argument that Newkirk’s action should have been dismissed as moot prior to the decision on the merits since prior thereto he had been returned from Clinton to Wallkill. Even after his return he remained subject to a new transfer at any time based on mere rumor or surmise which he had no opportunity to answer or refute. In light of the state’s continued insistence on its policy of not providing the inmate with any opportunity to respond to information against him, the likelihood of such a transfer was concrete rather than remote, speculative, or contingent. See Super Tire Engineering Co. v. McCorkle, 416 U.S. 115, 94 S.Ct. 1694, 40 L.Ed.2d 1, 42 U.S.L.W. 4507 (1974); Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941); McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 181-182, 47 S.Ct. 319, 71 L.Ed. 580 (1927). See generally Diamond, Federal Jurisdiction to Decide Moot Cases, 94 U.Pa.L.Rev. 125, 137-47 (1945). Furthermore, notwithstanding the Superintendent’s good faith assurances in support of appellants’ motion for dismissal that there would be no adverse effects from the transfer as far as consideration for parole was concerned, we think that Newkirk was entitled to a judicial decree to that effect.
