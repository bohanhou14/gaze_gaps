3. Conspiracy

Plaintiff's claim against defendant Dermott for conspiracy to injure another in reputation, trade, business, or profession similarly fails to meet the requirements for supplemental jurisdiction. This claim involves determining whether there was an agreement between Dermott and the Wiest defendants to cause reputational or commercial harm to the plaintiff, which requires an examination of actions and communications distinct from the federal trademark infringement issues. As seen in 292 F.3d 526, the facts pertaining to a conspiracy claim must be integral to the federal claims to warrant supplemental jurisdiction. Additionally, the principle outlined in 529 U.S. 765 emphasizes that jurisdictional questions must be resolved prior to addressing substantive claims, reinforcing that without a common nucleus of operative facts, we cannot proceed with state claims under supplemental jurisdiction.

Hence, the conspiracy claim does not satisfy the criteria for supplemental jurisdiction as described under 28 U.S.C. § 1367. Defendant Dermott’s motion to dismiss this claim will also be granted.

ORDER

IT IS ORDERED that defendant Richard H. Dermott's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims against him for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, and conspiracy to injure another in reputation, trade, business, or profession for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is GRANTED.

gold_text: Although the Wiest defendants have not filed any motions yet, federal district courts have an independent obligation to insure that subject matter jurisdiction exists. See, e.g., Wild v. Subscription Plus, Inc., 292 F.3d 526 (7th Cir.2002). Where subject matter jurisdiction is lacking, the court may dismiss a lawsuit on its own motion. Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 778, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000) (“Questions of jurisdiction, of course, should be given priority— since if there is no jurisdiction there is no authority to sit in judgment of anything else.”). Because I have already concluded that this court lacks supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim of misappropriation of trade secrets, I will dismiss this claim in its entirety as to all three defendants.
