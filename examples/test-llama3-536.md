Based on the reference cases, I analyzed the legal cases related to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) approval of state implementation plans (SIPs) for attaining air quality standards in the Lake Tahoe Basin.

In the case of 421 U.S. 60, the court held that the EPA has the authority to approve a SIP that does not meet the statute's requirements if the SIP is deemed to be sufficient to attain and maintain air quality standards. This case supports the EPA's approval of Nevada's SIP, which was deemed sufficient to attain and maintain air quality standards.

In the case of 700 F.2d 314, the court held that the EPA's approval of a SIP is not arbitrary or capricious if the agency has examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its decision. This case supports the EPA's approval of California's SIP, which was based on a modeling analysis that projected future carbon monoxide pollution in the Nevada side of the Tahoe Basin.

In the case of 650 F.2d 579, the court held that the EPA has the authority to approve a SIP that does not require indirect source review if the state has demonstrated that the SIP is sufficient to attain and maintain air quality standards. This case supports the EPA's approval of Nevada's SIP, which did not require indirect source review.

In the case of 572 F.2d 1143, the court held that the EPA's approval of a SIP is not arbitrary or capricious if the agency has examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its decision. This case supports the EPA's approval of California's SIP, which was based on a modeling analysis that projected future carbon monoxide pollution in the Nevada side of the Tahoe Basin.

In conclusion, the EPA's approval of Nevada's SIP and California's SIP are supported by the reference cases. The EPA has the authority to approve SIPs that do not meet the statute's requirements if the SIPs are deemed to be sufficient to attain and maintain air quality standards. The EPA's approval of the SIPs was based on a thorough analysis of the relevant data and a satisfactory explanation for its decisions. Therefore, the EPA's approval of the SIPs is not arbitrary or capricious.

gold_text: Nevada next contends that California’s SIP does not provide for attainment as expeditiously as possible because it does not include some of the measures adopted by the California Air Resources Board and which were included in an earlier implementation plan. Nevada does not explain how adoption of the other strategies would result in earlier attainment. We see no basis for holding, as a matter of law, that a state which has once adopted certain measures thereby commits itself to their inclusion in future plans. Such a result would discourage experimentation with pollution control methods. The statute requires attainment “as expeditiously as practicable,” a standard which permits some flexibility.
