The government's breach of the plea agreement in this case is a clear violation of the defendant's due process rights. As stated in United States v. Santobello, 404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971), once a plea has been entered and it "rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such a promise must be fulfilled." In this case, the government promised to recommend an adjusted offense level of 25 for the defendant's conduct, but instead advocated for an outcome different from the one it had promised.

The court in United States v. McGovern, 822 F.2d 739, 746 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 956, 108 S.Ct. 352, 98 L.Ed.2d 377 (1987), held that the government's breach of a plea agreement may require specific performance, and that the court should consider the possible prejudice to the defendant, the conduct of the government, and the public interest in determining whether to grant specific performance. Here, the government's conduct was a clear breach of its agreement with the defendant, and the defendant was prejudiced by the government's failure to abide by the plea agreement.

In determining whether to grant specific performance, the court should also consider the equities of the particular case, as stated in United States v. Margalli-Olvera, 43 F.3d 345, 349 (8th Cir.1994). In this case, the government's breach of the plea agreement was a clear violation of the defendant's due process rights, and the court should grant specific performance to remedy this breach.

In conclusion, the government's breach of the plea agreement in this case is a clear violation of the defendant's due process rights, and the court should grant specific performance to remedy this breach. The court should consider the possible prejudice to the defendant, the conduct of the government, and the public interest in determining whether to grant specific performance, and should also consider the equities of the particular case.

gold_text: Where, as here, the prosecutor has materially breached the plea agreement, the determination of the appropriate remedy is typically left to the discretion of the court. Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495. Among the options available to the court are permitting the defendant to be resentenced before a different judge consistent with the terms of the plea agreement (which, in this case, would require the government to fulfill its obligation to recommend a total offense level of 25), or permitting the defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty. Id. at 263, 92 S.Ct. 495; see also United States v. McGovern, 822 F.2d 739, 746 (8th Cir.1987). Our court has, in some cases, determined which remedy is appropriate on its own accord. See, e.g., Margalli-Olvera v. INS, 43 F.3d 345, 354-55 (8th Cir.1994) (remanding an order of deportation to the INS for specific performance of its agreement to remain silent on the issue of whether the petitioner was subject to deportation). We are not so required, however, United States v. Gomez, 271 F.3d 779, 782 (8th Cir.2001), and choose not to do so in this case, accord Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495 (remanding to state court for its determination of what remedy to apply to cure the prosecutionâ€™s breach of a plea agreement). Rather, we remand for the district court to determine, consistent with this opinion, the appropriate remedy to impose in the first instance.
