While evaluating the merit of plaintiff’s proposed amended complaint, it is instructive to consider the standards laid down in similar cases. A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief (355 U.S. 41; 774 F.2d 182). Here, the plaintiff relies on a factory order as constituting a new bona fide order for the modified MIRS machines.

However, the court must consider whether this amendment would withstand a motion to dismiss. As noted in United States v. Wood, 925 F.2d 1580, 1581 (7th Cir.1991), the court may not look beyond the pleadings when considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings. It is evident that the modification of the order does not necessarily constitute a new order within the specified window, rendering this claim legally insufficient.

Moreover, the general presumption is that “the rights of the parties are limited to the terms expressed in the contract” (754 F.2d 1059). Since the original contract contains explicit language regarding the period during which bona fide orders would trigger royalty obligations, any modification would need to unequivocally fall within these parameters. Consequently, the amendment appears futile as it fails to cure the legal deficiencies of the original complaint.

Accordingly, the court denies plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend the complaint.
