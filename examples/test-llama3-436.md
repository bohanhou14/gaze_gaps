In the given references cases, 930 F.2d 1512, 931 F.2d 33, and 918 F.2d 1371, there are several instances where defendants used false identities or provided false information to investigators, judges, or magistrates. In each case, the courts considered whether the defendants' actions constituted obstruction of justice, warranting a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.

In 930 F.2d 1512, the court held that providing a false name or identification document at arrest, without resulting in a significant hindrance to the investigation or prosecution, does not constitute obstruction of justice. However, in 931 F.2d 33, the court found that providing an alias to a judge or magistrate, even if it did not significantly impede the investigation, constitutes obstruction of justice.

In 918 F.2d 1371, the court considered a case where a defendant used multiple aliases and attempted to present a fake identification card as proof of citizenship. The court held that the defendant's actions constituted obstruction of justice, as he had attempted to present false information to the court and had a history of using false identities.

In each of these cases, the courts considered the defendant's intent and the potential impact of their actions on the investigation or prosecution. The courts also looked to the Sentencing Guidelines and the commentary to determine whether the defendant's actions constituted obstruction of justice.

Based on these cases, it is clear that using false identities or providing false information to investigators, judges, or magistrates can constitute obstruction of justice, warranting a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1. The courts will consider the defendant's intent, the potential impact of their actions, and the Sentencing Guidelines and commentary in determining whether the defendant's actions constitute obstruction of justice.

gold_text: The amended Commentary thus gives some new substance to Rodriguez’s argument. The fact that he claimed to be Rodriguez at his arrest and during the police investigation does not support the adjustment because the alias did not significantly hinder the investigation. See Application Notes 3(g) and 4(a); United States v. Ur-banek, 930 F.2d 1512 (10th Cir.1991) (reversing adjustment because alias did not significantly impede investigation). And, although we do not decide the issue, the fact that he claimed to be Rodriguez before the probation officer and the district court judge might well have been immaterial given that he acknowledged all of his aliases. See Application Note 3(f), 3(h), and 4(c); compare United States v. Gardiner, 931 F.2d 33 (10th Cir.1991) (upholding adjustment where defendant failed to disclose true identity in three separate appearances before magistrate); United States v. Yerks, 918 F.2d 1371, 1375 (8th Cir.1990).
