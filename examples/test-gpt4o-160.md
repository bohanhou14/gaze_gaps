Regarding Pepper Hamilton’s request for compensation for defending its fee application, this issue has been addressed under different circumstances in various cases. In the reference case 206 B.R. 721, the courts have generally discouraged penalizing defendants for defending their fee applications unless it significantly benefits the estate. This aligns with the position that statutory fee-shifting provisions aim to encourage private enforcement of rights and facilitate access to legal representation, especially in cases like enforcing civil rights or environmental protection (Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 483 U.S. 711).

However, reference case 713 F.2d 972 establishes that in common benefit actions under certain statutes like Title I of LMRDA, counsel fees can be awarded for time spent litigating the fee application, provided it furthers the policy considerations of the legislation. In contrast, reference case 540 F.2d 102 emphasizes that services performed to benefit the fund should directly contribute to its creation, increase, protection, or preservation, rather than merely benefiting the attorney. The district court, therefore, erred in awarding fees for services that did not benefit the fund.

Therefore, while preparing fee applications is compensable under 11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(6), defending these applications may not always justify compensation unless it produces a tangible benefit to the estate. Given the discrepancies surrounding the actual monetary benefit from Pepper’s litigations for fee applications, I am inclined to disallow fees specifically associated with defending the fee application, honoring the precedent that fees must directly benefit the estate or creditors. Compensation should align with customary practices outside bankruptcy contexts as indicated in 11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(3)(F).

gold_text: Further analysis suggests that it is customary for counsel to collect its fees and expenses for pursuing collection in a statutory fee-shifting case such as civil rights, environmental protection, and antitrust cases. This is because it is only appropriate that a wrong doer should pay the attorney for efforts that are designed to enforce a legislative statutory substantive right. Contrast this with the common-fund case where the attorney’s efforts have created a fund to be shared by his “clients.” See discussion in In re Blue Coal Corporation, 206 B.R. 721, 723 (Bankr.M.D.Pa.1997). See, also, Pawlak v. Greenawalt, 713 F.2d 972, 977 (3d Cir.1983), where in common-fund cases, such a reimbursement would necessarily benefit counsel at the expense of the beneficiaries and, normally, not be allowed. Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Carp., (Lindy II), 540 F.2d 102, 111 (3d Cir.1976) (en banc). The question becomes whether bankruptcy cases are akin to fee-shifting cases or common-fund cases. Even though the following quote dealt with a bonus request, I conclude that it has equal application when considering the legitimacy of a request that the estate bear the expense of fee litigation.
