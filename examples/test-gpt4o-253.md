2. Assignee’s Rights and Standing

The core issue here concerns the rights of GMAC, as an assignee, and whether such rights confer standing to seek relief from stay. Under established principles, an assignee merely steps into the shoes of the assignor (367 B.R. 138). This doctrine ensures that an assignee acquires no greater rights than those that were possessed by the assignor. The Ninth Circuit has affirmed that, "[t]he assignee 'stands in the shoes' of the assignor" (374 B.R. 210).

In this case, GMAC asserts its right to enforce the Note based on its status as an assignee. The court in Boyajian further emphasized that the question of what rights and remedies pass with an assignment depends on the interest of the parties and the terms of the assignment (367 B.R. 138). Here, GMAC has failed to provide sufficient documentary evidence that the Note and DOT were properly transferred through the chain of assignments from GreenPoint to Lehman, then to SASC, and finally into the Trust. Without this proof, GMAC cannot demonstrate that it has validly inherited the rights necessary to enforce the Note.

The court in Trejos clarified that a mere assignment, without more, does not modify the underlying obligations or confer additional rights beyond those possessed by the assignor. This underscores that GMAC, even as an assignee, must show that the obligations and rights it seeks to enforce were indeed transferred through a valid and complete series of assignments (374 B.R. 210).

Therefore, based on the principles outlined in these cases, GMAC has not substantiated its claim to stand in the assignor’s shoes with respect to the Note and DOT, hence failing to establish its standing to seek relief from stay.

Therefore, the Debtor’s argument that the Note is unenforceable because the funder of the Note was not the payee fails. The Note is still valid and can be enforced by the party who has the right to enforce it under applicable Arizona law.
