Wilkinson contends that Szafran's actions constituted a municipal policy that violated his First Amendment rights. For municipal liability under § 1983, a plaintiff must show that a policy or custom was the "moving force" behind the constitutional violation. As held in Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Servs., 436 U. S. 658, a municipality cannot be held liable under § 1983 on a respondeat superior basis. Instead, the plaintiff must provide evidence of a policy or custom with the force of law, per reference case 398 U.S. 144. In this instance, the conduct by Szafran, Dornisch, and Costello does not amount to a municipal policy, but rather isolated actions by individual council members. 

Moreover, for a claim predicated on failure to train, liability is only established where the inadequacy of training amounts to "deliberate indifference" to the rights of individuals, as elucidated in reference case 489 U.S. 378. There is no evidence showing deliberate indifference by the Township in training its Council members, nor that the lack of training was the moving force behind any alleged First Amendment violation.

Therefore, we find the plaintiff’s argument unpersuasive, and we shall grant summary judgment in favor of Bensalem Township.

To support a finding of “policy or custom”, Wilkinson must at least show that the municipality did not implement necessary training to ensure that employees would not violate the constitutional rights of the persons with whom they came into contact.
