The case presented involves a civil rights action where the plaintiff, Lisa Teague, alleges that defendant Randel Overton caused her to be wrongfully arrested and falsely imprisoned. Overton appeals the district court's denial of his motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.

In determining whether the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, the court must assess the objective legal reasonableness of the action at the time of the alleged violation and ask whether the right was sufficiently clear that a reasonable officer would understand that what he is doing violates that right. (515 U.S. 304)

In this case, the probable cause affidavit filed in support of Teague's arrest warrant demonstrated a substantial probability that the crimes of forgery and embezzlement were committed by Teague. (78 F.3d 484) The court concluded that none of the omitted facts were "directly exculpatory," and that, considered together, "would not have vitiated probable cause for the arrest warrant." (Appellant's append. 1 at 224)

The court also noted that defendant Izatt gave false and embellished testimony to the grand jury; however, the court concluded that none of these untruths and embellishments were material to the grand jury's probable cause determination. (Appellant's append. 1 at 225)

The court ultimately denied Overton's summary judgment motion based on qualified immunity, concluding that there were conflicting testimonies which relate to the reasonableness of Overton's actions in securing the arrest warrant and ultimately causing Teague's imprisonment.

We have jurisdiction to evaluate whether the affidavit is legally sufficient to support probable cause to arrest Teague. We review de novo the legal issue of whether the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant. (United States v. Edwards, 242 F.3d 928, 933 (10th Cir.2001))

In conclusion, the court's denial of Overton's summary judgment motion based on qualified immunity was appropriate, as the affidavit filed in support of the arrest warrant demonstrated sufficient probable cause to support an arrest. (82 F.3d 1556)

In performing the above analysis, we review the revised affidavit de novo and determine its sufficiency as a matter of law. See id. at 1562. Because the sufficiency of the affidavit is a legal issue reviewed de novo, it is the type of issue over which we have jurisdiction in an interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunity. See Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 312-13, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995).
