This court must also consider the issue of contributory negligence under Tennessee law, as posited by the defendant. It is essential to address the choice-of-law principles implicated by this defense. Under the framework established by case law, courts must ascertain the applicable substantive law in diversity cases. In 313 U.S. 487, the Supreme Court emphasized that federal courts should apply the law of the state in which they sit, and not what they assume the law ought to be. This principle supports the presumption that the substantive law of Tennessee could potentially apply here.

Furthermore, according to 376 U.S. 612, the District Court's decision regarding transfers and their consequent legal implications indicates that the laws of the forum state could significantly diverge from those of the original jurisdiction. Therefore, Wisconsin's transfer does not necessitate the application of Wisconsin's substantive laws if Tennessee's law has substantive connections to the case.

Referring to 304 U.S. 64, it was made clear that, even in the presence of federal procedural rules, the substantive state law applicable to the rights of the parties must govern. Therefore, if Tennessee law provides that contributory negligence is a bar to recovery, the court must take it into consideration.

In light of these precedents, the court finds it premature to strike the second affirmative defense of contributory negligence without a fuller examination of the substantive choice-of-law issues. Accordingly, the defendant’s argument that Tennessee law bars recovery due to contributory negligence presents a legal question that warrants further exploration. The plaintiffs’ motion to strike this defense is therefore denied at this stage.

gold_text: Generally, the Wisconsin conflict of law rules are applicable in this court. Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941); Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). However, when an action is transferred from one jurisdiction to another, other factors are also to be considered in determining the applicable law. Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 84 S.Ct. 805, 11 L.Ed.2d 945 (1964). 28 U.S.C. § 1404 and § 1406 govern the transfer of an action from one district court to another. The order of the Illinois court does not specify under which of these sections the transfer was made. The court concludes that the conflicts question should be determined by the law of Wisconsin.
