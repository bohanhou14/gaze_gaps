The issue of estoppel is a complex one, and the courts have grappled with it in various contexts. In the case of 39 F.3d 755, the court held that the doctrine of promissory estoppel may be applied to enforce oral interpretations of employee benefit plans, provided that the party seeking to enforce the estoppel can show that they relied on the oral interpretation to their detriment.

In the case at hand, Mr. Kessen argues that the Trustees were estopped from suspending his pension benefits because he relied on the oral interpretations of the Plan provided by Mr. Sullivan, Mr. McManus, and Mr. Bojan. However, as I have noted earlier, there is no evidence to support Mr. Kessen's argument that Mr. Sullivan or Mr. McManus ever purported to interpret the Plan document. Therefore, the Plumbers' Pension Fund cannot be estopped to deny benefits based on their statements.

Furthermore, the court in 987 F.2d 410 held that the doctrine of promissory estoppel is not applicable to ERISA plans, as the statute provides a specific procedure for resolving disputes over plan interpretation. Similarly, in 9 F.3d 645, the court held that the doctrine of promissory estoppel is not applicable to a plan that is subject to ERISA.

In the case of 893 F.2d 1283, the court held that the doctrine of promissory estoppel may be applied to enforce oral interpretations of employee benefit plans, provided that the party seeking to enforce the estoppel can show that they relied on the oral interpretation to their detriment. However, as I have noted earlier, there is no evidence to support Mr. Kessen's argument that he relied on the oral interpretations to his detriment.

In conclusion, the issue of estoppel is complex, and the courts have grappled with it in various contexts. However, in this case, there is no evidence to support Mr. Kessen's argument that the Trustees were estopped from suspending his pension benefits, and the Plumbers' Pension Fund cannot be estopped to deny benefits based on their statements.

gold_text: If Mr. Kessen’s statement of what the Plan Secretary, Mr. Bojan, allegedly said is taken as true, as it must be for purposes of defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the issue becomes whether ERISA permits enforcement of Mr. Bojan’s statement. In this Circuit, it is still an open question whether oral interpretations of Plan documents may be given effect. E.g., Miller v. Taylor Insulation Co., 39 F.3d 755, 759 (7th Cir. 1994); Schoonmaker v. Employee Savings Plan, 987 F.2d 410, 412-13 (7th Cir.1993). (While a footnote in Thomason v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 9 F.3d 645, 650 n. 10 (7th Cir.1993), indicates the question could be answered adversely to Mr. Kessen, I conclude that Miller still leaves the question open.) See, e.g., Lockrey v. Leavitt Tube Emp. Profit Sharing Plan, 766 F.Supp. 1510 (N.D.Ill.1991) (J. Rovner), following Kane v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 893 F.2d 1283 (11th Cir.1990), in holding that ERISA would permit an oral interpretation that is not inconsistent with the language of a Plan document. In appropriate cases, it seems reasonable to hold that a Plan may be bound by oral interpretations of a Plan document made by an agent with authority to provide information to a Plan participant in the face of reliance by a participant on the interpretation.
