The case at hand involves a dispute over the ownership of copyright in a series of musical compositions, known as the "Songs." The plaintiff, National Center for Jewish Film, Inc., claims to own the copyright in the Songs, while the defendant, Ergo Media, Inc., asserts that it is the rightful owner.

To establish copyright infringement, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant copied the Songs without permission. In order to do so, the plaintiff must demonstrate that it owns the copyright in the Songs, and that the defendant copied the Songs in a way that is actionable under the Copyright Act.

In this case, the plaintiff claims that it owns the copyright in the Songs because it was the assignee of all right, title, and interest to the films in which the Songs were used. The plaintiff relies on a written agreement between itself and the original composer of the Songs, Joseph Green, which grants the plaintiff the exclusive rights to distribute the films containing the Songs. The defendant, on the other hand, claims that it is the rightful owner of the copyright in the Songs because it was the assignee of the copyright from the original composer.

In order to determine who owns the copyright in the Songs, the court must first determine whether the Songs are considered "works for hire" under the 1909 Copyright Act. The 1909 Copyright Act defines a "work for hire" as a work created by an employee in the regular course of their employment, or a work created by an independent contractor at the instance and expense of the employer. The court has previously held that the "instance and expense" test is met when the employer pays for the creation of the work and the employee creates the work at the employer's instance.

In this case, the court finds that the Songs are considered "works for hire" under the 1909 Copyright Act because the original composer was paid by Joseph Green to create the Songs at his instance. Therefore, the copyright in the Songs is owned by Joseph Green, and the plaintiff's claim to the copyright is invalid.

The court also finds that the 1938 and 1966 copyright registrations are invalid as a matter of law because they were not made in compliance with the requirements of the Copyright Act at the time. The court relies on the case of Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991), which held that a copyright registration must be made in compliance with the requirements of

See Feist Publications v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 1295-96, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991); CMM Cable Rep, Inc., 97 F.3d at 1512 (1st Cir.1996); Accusoft Corp. v.

It is the first prong of the suit requirement which here proves fatal to Ergo’s claim.
