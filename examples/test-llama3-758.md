The case presented is a complex one, involving a dispute over the ownership of patents. The plaintiff, F. A. R. Liquidating Corporation (FAR), claims that it is the rightful owner of the patents, while the defendant, the Attorney General of the United States, argues that the patents were vested in the Alien Property Custodian by Executive Order No. 8785.

FAR claims that it entered into a contract with Fernseh Aktiengesellschaft (Fernseh) on May 15, 1941, and that the contract was consummated when Fernseh sent its acceptance cable on June 14, 1941. FAR argues that the contract was binding and that it is entitled to the patents.

The defendant, on the other hand, argues that the contract was never consummated and that the patents were vested in the Alien Property Custodian by Executive Order No. 8785. The defendant also argues that there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether the acceptance cable was sent before 1:10 P. M. on June 14, 1941, the effective date of the Executive Order.

The court below granted FAR's motion for summary judgment, finding that there was no genuine issue of fact as to the ownership of the patents. The defendant appeals this decision.

In reviewing the case, the court notes that the correspondence between FAR and Fernseh is ambiguous and that there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether the contract was consummated. The court also notes that the evidence presented by FAR is insufficient to establish the fact that the acceptance cable was sent before 1:10 P. M. on June 14, 1941.

The court therefore reverses the decision of the court below and remands the case for further proceedings. The court holds that there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether the contract was consummated and that the evidence presented by FAR is insufficient to establish the fact that the acceptance cable was sent before 1:10 P. M. on June 14, 1941.

This case is similar to Sartor v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corp., 321 U.S. 620, 64 S.Ct. 724, 88 L.Ed. 967, where the Supreme Court held that summary judgment is improper where there is a genuine issue of fact as to the meaning of written words. It is also similar to Begnaud

gold_text: FAR also contends that since defendant cross-moved for summary judgment, it is now precluded from questioning the propriety of disposing of the case upon such a motion. But, it is well established that cross-motions for summary judgment do not warrant the trial court granting summary judgment unless one of the moving p'arties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law upon facts that are not genuinely disputed.
