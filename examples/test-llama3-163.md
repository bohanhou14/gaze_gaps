The court must determine whether the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. In reviewing the settlement, the court should consider the factors set forth in United States v. Miami, 614 F.2d 1322, 1330-31 (5th Cir.1981), such as whether the settlement is the result of good faith, arms-length negotiations. The court must also ensure that the notice of the proposed settlement is given to all members of the class in a manner directed by the court. Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(e).

In this case, the proposed settlement provides for a payment of $5,250,000 into a settlement fund and a consent decree that the defendants will cease and desist in harvesting corneas of autopsy subjects without consent of the next of kin or others with appropriate authority to consent. The settlement also provides for the appointment of a special master to determine fair and reasonable compensation to be paid to claimants.

The court has considered the objections raised by the sole objector and has concluded that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. The settlement provides for a significant payment to the class members and ensures that the defendants will no longer engage in the improper practice of harvesting corneas without consent. The notice of the proposed settlement was given to all members of the class in a manner directed by the court, and the court has held a hearing to consider the objections and concerns of the class members.

Therefore, the court hereby approves the proposed settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate under the circumstances. The settlement shall be implemented in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement, and the court shall appoint a special master to determine fair and reasonable compensation to be paid to claimants.
