This case involves a suit brought by Dr. Thomas R. Monroe, claiming that two officers of the Pueblo Police Department violated his First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights when they entered a building owned by him but occupied as a residence by Cathy and Gilbert Trujillo and their family. The court granted the motion to dismiss, and Dr. Monroe appeals.

In reviewing the grant of summary judgment, we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Simms v. Okla. ex rel. Dep’t of Mental Health & Substance Abuse Servs., 165 F.3d 1321, 1326 (10th Cir.1999).

The court found that the officers entered the residence for the purposes of enforcing a court-ordered home visit, not for the purpose of conducting a search. United States v. Hutchings, 127 F.3d 1255, 1259 (10th Cir.1997). Dr. Monroe failed to allege facts showing that he was subjected to a search. Moreover, the officers enjoyed absolute immunity from liability for damages in a suit challenging conduct prescribed by the court order. Valdez v. City & County of Denver, 878 F.2d 1285, 1286 (10th Cir.1989).

In addition, the court noted that Dr. Monroe failed to point to specific legal errors or make objections to points on which the district court based its dismissal of the complaint. As we noted in Reference case 992 F.2d 1053, "it is well-established that government activity is not a search unless it intrudes upon an individual’s justified expectation of privacy." The court concluded that Dr. Monroe has failed to allege facts showing that the officers used their sensory perceptions to conduct a “search” in the legal sense of the word.

The court also rejected Dr. Monroe’s argument that the officers violated the order because it provided that no other person besides the Trujillos and Department employees were to be allowed in the home during the home visit. As we noted in Reference case 151 F.3d 1313, "an official charged with the duty of executing a facially valid court order enjoys absolute immunity from liability for damages in a suit challenging conduct prescribed by that order."

In conclusion, the court's grant of summary judgment is affirmed. Dr. Monroe's claims were dismissed because he failed to allege facts

gold_text: In sum, the record clearly shows that Dr. Monroe failed to state facts or produce evidence showing that Officers Waring and Touwick violated his First, Fourth, or Fourteenth Amendment rights. The officers are further entitled to absolute immunity under the circumstances of this case. Because he cannot demonstrate that the officers abridged his constitutional rights, the district court also properly dismissed Dr. Monroe’s claims against the Pueblo Police Department and Chief Billings. See Trigalet v. City of Tulsa, 289 F.3d 1150, 1155-56 (10th Cir.2001) (holding that even if a city’s police policies, training, and supervision are unconstitutional, the city cannot be held liable under § 1983 if the officers did not actually commit a constitutional violation); Myers v. Okla. County Bd. of County Com’rs, 151 F.3d 1313, 1316 (10th Cir.1998) (holding that a municipality cannot be liable under § 1983 for its employees’ actions if the employees committed no constitutional violation); Butler v. City of Norman, 992 F.2d 1053, 1055 (10th Cir.1993) (“A supervisor is not liable under § 1983 unless an ‘affirmative link’ exists between the constitutional deprivation and either the supervisor’s personal participation, his exercise of control or direction, or his failure to supervise.”). We conclude that this appeal is frivolous.
