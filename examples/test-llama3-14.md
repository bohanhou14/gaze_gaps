The case at hand is a complex one, involving a protection order issued by the district court to limit communication between the parties and the media. The order also required the removal of a website operated by the officers, which contained information and recordings that the court deemed to be prejudicial to the trial.

In reviewing the order, we must consider the prior restraint doctrine, which requires that the record establish a clear and present danger of prejudice sufficient to justify the restriction. As the court in Brown v. United States, 218 F.3d 415 (5th Cir. 2000), held, a prior restraint on speech is presumed to be unconstitutional, and the party seeking to impose the restraint must demonstrate a substantial likelihood of prejudice.

Here, the court's order was based on the testimony of the parties, which suggested that they had made extra-judicial comments to the media and on the website. However, as the court in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), held, the mere fact that a party has made extra-judicial statements does not necessarily establish a nexus between the statements and the potential for prejudice to the jury venire.

Furthermore, the court's order was not narrowly tailored to excise only those portions of the website that were likely to cause prejudice. Instead, it required the removal of the entire website, which is a broad and overbroad restriction on speech.

In conclusion, while the court's concern about prejudice to the trial is understandable, the order issued is not a narrowly tailored solution to that problem. In the absence of a clear and present danger of prejudice, the court's order is an unreasonable determination of the facts and is therefore unconstitutional. The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

gold_text: In sum, the district court erred in concluding that the entirety of the Website was substantially likely to cause prejudice. Accordingly, the court’s determination that the entire Website “demonstrate^] a substantial likelihood of impacting the jury venire,” is overbroad and clearly erroneous. See Canal Ins. Co. v. Thornton, 279 F.2d 41, 43 (5th Cir.1960) (concluding that a district court’s determination was clearly erroneous when “there was no basis [in] the record” to support its finding); cf. Batchelor v. Cain, 682 F.3d 400, 413 (5th Cir.2012) (concluding that the state appellate court made an erroneous factual determination that a habeas petitioner waived his request to represent himself when “the record admitted] of no basis” to support the finding). As a result, we must vacate the portion of the order requiring the “takedown” of the Website.
