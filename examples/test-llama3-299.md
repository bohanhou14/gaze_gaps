In this case, the Court must consider the appropriate standards for enforcement of a "John Doe" summons issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS issued a summons to Pittsburgh Trade Exchange, Inc. and its sole stockholder, requiring them to produce records identifying the names and addresses of their members and the bartering transactions they engaged in for the calendar years 1978 and 1979.

The Court held that the IRS's representation that the targets of the investigation were unknown was not disputed by the Exchange, and therefore, the IRS had a reasonable basis for believing that unknown taxpayers may have failed to comply with the internal revenue law. This is supported by the reference case 420 U.S. 141, which held that the IRS's investigation was legitimate and not harassment.

Moreover, the Court found that the IRS's summons was not overly broad, and that the information sought was not readily available from other sources. This is consistent with the reference case 488 F.2d 953, which held that a summons should be enforced if it is reasonable and not overly broad.

In conclusion, the Court affirmed the order of the district court, enforcing the "John Doe" summons issued by the IRS. The IRS had a reasonable basis for believing that unknown taxpayers may have failed to comply with the internal revenue law, and the summons was not overly broad. The reference cases 420 U.S. 141 and 488 F.2d 953 support this conclusion.

gold_text: The second issue raised by The Exchange was that the real purpose of the summons was not determination of member tax liability, but general research into the economic impact of barter exchanges. The Exchange produced evidence reflecting a Congressional and Internal Revenue Service concern about barter and its possible impact on the federal revenue. In advancing the contention that a research purpose prevented enforcement of a section 7602 summons, The Exchange relies on United States v. Humble Oil & Refining Co., 488 F.2d 953 (5th Cir. 1974), vacated and remanded, 421 U.S. 943, 95 S.Ct. 1670, 44 L.Ed.2d 97 (1975), affâ€™d per curiam on remand, 518 F.2d 747 (5th Cir. 1975), in which the court refused to enforce a summons which it found was designed solely to help a regional Internal Revenue Service office keep up to date on what was going on in a local community. Humble Oil is a slender reed, since the judgment based on the first opinion was vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of United States v. Bisceglia, 420 U.S. 141, 142, 95 S.Ct. 915, 917, 43 L.Ed.2d 88 (1975), and the per curiam opinion on remand is conclusory. Recently the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has had occasion to explain the narrow scope of the Humble Oil holding:
