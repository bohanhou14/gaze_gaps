The final issue pertains to the Secretary’s request for prospective injunctive relief to prevent future violations of the FLSA. Courts have highlighted that the primary purpose of an injunction under the FLSA is remedial rather than punitive (30 F.3d 654). Injunctive relief aims to enforce compliance with the Act to prevent recurring violations, not to penalize the employer (981 F.2d 1358). Factors for the court to weigh include the employer’s past and present conduct, and the likelihood of future compliance (963 F.2d 110). Given Hogar’s demonstrated history of noncompliance and Diaz's personal responsibility over wage practices, the Court finds it necessary to issue an injunction against future violations (825 F.2d 1381). This ensures adherence to statutory obligations and alleviates the investigative burden on the Wage and Hour Division.

gold_text: The second remaining issue is a request by the Secretary for a prospective injunction restraining Defendants from future violations of the FLSA. The FLSA allows a court, in its discretion, to issue such injunctions. 29 U.S.C.A. § 217; Hector I.Nieves, 91 F.Supp.2d at 449. A court determining whether to issue an injunction should consider (1) the employer’s prior and present conduct; (2) any pattern of repetitive violations; (3) an employer’s intent to violate the FLSA; (4) the employer’s good faith attempt to comply with the FLSA; (5) whether the employer complied once it became aware of the FLSA’s requirements; (6) efforts to prevent recurrence; (7) the threat of violations in the future; and (8) absence of bad faith. See Reich v. Petroleum Sales, Inc., 30 F.3d 654, 657 (6th Cir.1994); Martin v. Coventry Fire Dist., 981 F.2d 1358, 1362 (1st Cir. 1992); Martin v. Funtime, Inc., 963 F.2d 110, 114 (6th Cir.1992); Brock v. Big Bear Market No. 3, 825 F.2d 1381, 1383 (9th Cir.1987).
