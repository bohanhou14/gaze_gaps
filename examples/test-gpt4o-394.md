The court’s determination of the validity of the search must also consider whether the consent obtained was lawful and clear. In the case cited as 515 F.3d 1139, the court noted that while the Fourth Amendment violation occurred, the illegality was not clearly established, thus granting qualified immunity. In this case, the defendant's consent to search his vehicle appeared to be voluntary and not coerced, aligning with the principles mentioned in reference case 441 F.3d 890. This case emphasized that federal constitutional rights are not automatically infringed by state law violations without independent justification. Here, the totality of circumstances indicated that the officers’ actions did not amount to coercion or unreasonable search, and the defendant's consent was considered free and unrestrained. Therefore, as in 515 F.3d 1139, there is a basis to uphold the search's validity, affirming the denial of the motion to suppress.
