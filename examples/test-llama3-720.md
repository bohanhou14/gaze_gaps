The case New England Wooden Ware Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue highlights the significance of understanding the real needs of a business for operating funds. In this regard, the court emphasizes the importance of considering the timing of needs and availability of resources, similar to the approach taken in Bardahl Mfg. Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, T.C.Memo.1965â€”200, CCH Tax Ct.Mem., Dec. 27,494(M), at 1033.

The court also notes that the accumulation of earnings beyond reasonable needs of the business may be determinative of the purpose to avoid income tax with respect to shareholders, unless the corporation proves to the contrary (SEC. 533). This is akin to the reasoning in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, 1960, 363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218.

In the context of the case at hand, New England Wooden Ware Corporation's accumulation of earnings was motivated by its desire to expand and diversify its business, as well as to maintain its competitiveness in the market. The corporation's plans to enter new product fields, such as plastics and paint cans, were feasible and specific, and it had a clear intention to use the accumulated earnings for these purposes.

In conclusion, the court's decision in New England Wooden Ware Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue underscores the importance of considering the real needs of a business and the feasibility of its plans for using accumulated earnings. This approach is consistent with the principles outlined in reference cases such as 358 F.2d 867, 281 F.2d 488, and 241 F.2d 197.
