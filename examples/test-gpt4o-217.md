In support of our decision, we reference Home Construction Corp. v. United States, 439 F.2d 1165, which established that after an F reorganization, loss carrybacks must not provide a taxpayer more favorable treatment than if the loss had occurred pre-reorganization. This aligns with the teachings in Libson Shops, requiring losses be traced to a specific business unit or activity for carryback eligibility. Similarly, Davant v. Commissioner, 403 F.2d 622, expands the F reorganization's scope but does not nullify the necessity of loss-tracing rules. Further, the case of Mach. v. C.I.R., 403 F.2d 611, reaffirms the principle. Moreover, legislative changes in the 1954 Code, discussed in Maxwell Hardware Co. v. C.I.R., 343 F.2d 713, illustrate Congressional intentions to eliminate previous judicial precedents but did not extend to unregulated carrybacks in F reorganizations. Finally, Eastern Color Printing Co. v. Commissioner, 45 T.C. 234, underlines that while statutory changes aimed to simplify tax code complexities, they preserved the necessity of establishing continuity in business operations for tax benefits. As such, the Commissioner’s application of the Libson Shops loss-tracing rule remains valid and necessary for addressing post-reorganization loss carrybacks. National Tea’s claimed loss carryback thus fails to comply with these requirements, warranting the denial.

gold_text: Our analysis of this issue dovetails nicely with the results reached by other courts. Both the Fifth and Ninth Circuits have applied the Libson Shops loss-tracing rule to regulate the carryback of an acquiring corporation’s post-reorganization net operating loss to the transferor corporation’s pre-reorganization income in the context of an “F” reorganization. Home Construction Corp. of America v. United States, 439 F.2d 1165 (5th Cir.1971) ; Associated Machine v. Commissioner, 403 F.2d 622 (9th Cir.1968); Estate of Stauffer v. Commissioner, 403 F.2d 611 (9th Cir.1968). Our holding today is also consistent with the Second Circuit’s decision in Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. United States, 568 F.2d 811 (2d Cir.1976). Although the Second Circuit never discussed the Libson Shops loss-tracing rule in allowing the carrybacks in that ease, the court did note that the carryback did not trigger “the accounting problems which motivated section 381(b)(3),” and consequently it can be safely assumed that the result in that case is consistent with the Libson Shops loss-tracing rule. Id. at 822. National Tea cites numerous cases that state that the Libson Shops loss-tracing rule has no validity under the 1954 Code, but these cases all involve net loss carryovers, not carry-backs. Exel Corp. v. United States, 451 F.2d 80 (8th Cir.1971); United States v. Adkins-Phelps, Inc., 400 F.2d 737 (8th Cir. 1968); Frederick Steel Co. v. Commissioner, 375 F.2d 351 (6th Cir.1967), certiorari denied, 389 U.S. 901, 88 S.Ct. 219, 19 L.Ed.2d 217; Maxwell Hardware v. Commissioner, 343 F.2d 713 (9th Cir.1965); Clarksdale v. Commissioner, 45 T.C. 234 (1965). Since Congress replaced Libson Shops and other judicially created schemes with its own statutory scheme for carryovers, but did not do so for carrybacks, these cases do not detract at all from our holding today.
