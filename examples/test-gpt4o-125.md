M.C.C. argues that it was entitled to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment. This argument is grounded in the principle that actions enforcing legal rights as opposed to equitable claims generally warrant a jury trial. Referencing Beacon Theatres, 359 U.S. 500, it is clear that a right to a jury trial in cases involving both legal and equitable claims is protected unless exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise. The district court, however, treated this as purely an equitable action, thus denying the request for a jury.

In further support, M.C.C. cites United States v. Republic Steel Corp., 362 U.S. 482, which determined the broad interpretation of the statutory provisions under the River and Harbor Act. However, the main issue hinged on the interpretation and not the provision of a jury trial. Similarly, the reference in Beacon Theatres, 369 U.S. 469, reinforces that where legal claims are involved, only pressing circumstances can justify deviation from a jury trial. The Supreme Court in Beacon Theatres also underscored the responsibility of federal courts to uphold the right to a jury trial in mixed claims cases (369 U.S. 469).

The court, in this case, failed to delineate legal claims that inherently warrant jury determination from equitable aspects, thus infringing on M.C.C.'s Seventh Amendment rights as articulated in case 396 U.S. 531. Given the precedent underscoring the necessity of a jury trial unless clearly mandated otherwise, the district court's exclusion of a jury trial was erroneous.

Therefore, the appropriate remedy must rectify this procedural oversight by ensuring the legal claims raised by M.C.C. receive a jury trial, consistent with constitutional mandates and established case law.

gold_text: M.C.C. contends that it was entitled to a jury trial and that the district court therefore erred in striking its demand for one. The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution provides that in “Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.” U.S. Const. Amend. VII. The Supreme Court has held that it is “the nature of the issue to be tried rather than the character of the overall action” that is determinative. Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 538, 90 S.Ct. 733, 738, 24 L.Ed.2d 729 (1970). When there are both legal and equitable issues present, then the right to a jury trial as to the legal issues remains. Dairy Queen v. Wood, 369 U.S. 469, 82 S.Ct. 894, 8 L.Ed.2d 44 (1962); Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959). Therefore, we must examine whether any of the issues were legal in nature.
