III. Legal Analysis

A. Applicability of Arbitrary and Capricious Standard

Under 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b), this Court evaluates bid protests consistent with the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 551-59, 701-06. Section 706 of the APA mandates that a “reviewing court shall... hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law“ (Reference case 554 F.3d 1029; Reference case 554 F.3d 1029). Therefore, we must determine whether the Agency's actions in overriding the CICA stay exhibit a rational basis or violated any regulations or procedures (Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, 238 F.3d 1324, 1332 (Fed.Cir.2001); 554 F.3d 1029).

B. Consideration of Injunctive Relief Criteria

To ascertain whether injunctive relief is appropriate, we examine whether (1) the plaintiff has succeeded on the merits, (2) the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief, (3) the balance of hardships favors the plaintiff, and (4) whether granting the relief serves the public interest (PGBA, LLC v. United States, 389 F.3d 1219, 1228-29 (Fed.Cir.2004); Reference case 389 F.3d 1219). Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, Alaska (480 U.S. 531, 546 n. 12) further establishes that success on the merits rather than likelihood suffices for a permanent injunction.

C. Public Interest and Injunctive Relief

In determining whether injunctive relief serves the public interest, we must align with Congress' intent in enacting CICA. Ensuring a fair and competitive procurement process is paramount, as recognized in several judicial precedents (Reilly’s Wholesale Produce v. United States, 73 Fed.Cl. 710; Supreme Foodservice GmbH v. United States, 109 Fed.Cl. 369) (Reference case 389 F.3d 1219).

IV. Conclusion

Based on the analysis above, the plaintiff has demonstrated sufficient grounds for declaratory relief, rendering enjoinment against the Agency's override decision justified. This protects the statutory integrity as mandated by the CICA automatic stay while supporting a transparent review process by the GAO. Consequently, we grant the plaintiff's

gold_text: When making a determination on whether or not to apply an injunction, this Court typically evaluates the following four factors: 1) the likelihood of success on the merits; 2) whether plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction; 3) balance of harm to the 'respective parties if the injunction is either granted or not granted; and 4) the public interest involved in granting the injunction. Centech Grp., Inc. v. United States, 554 F.3d 1029, 1037 (Fed. Cir. 2009); PGBA, LLC v. United States, 389 F.3d 1219, 1228-29 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Mobile Med. Int’l Corp. v. United States, 95 Fed.Cl. 706, 742-43 (2010). Regardless of Congress’ decision to exclude the elements oí a preliminary injunction from the CICA automatic stay, “the likelihood of success on the merits” factor is wholly1 inapplicable to CICA overrides. The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo during the pendency of a bid protest while the Court makes a decision on the merits. When a plaintiff challenges an agency’s decision to override the automatic CICA stay, the Court never proceeds to briefing or a hearing on the merits in the traditional'sense. Instead, the Court is asked to review the override, while the GAO engages in a review of the merits. Once the Court has come to a decision on the override, jurisdiction over the protest reverts back to the GAO. If this Court were to impose an injunction during its review of the CICA override, it would more closely resemble a permanent injunction, as it would ultimately dispose of the case in this Court. However, a permanent injunction is not truly what the protestor seeks, because the protestor is not requesting the Agency cease all work in perpetuity, but rather that the Agency abide by the CICA stay.
