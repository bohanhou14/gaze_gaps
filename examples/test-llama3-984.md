The cases provided involve patent infringement and the validity of a patent for a cleaning aid. In each case, the court examined the patent claims and the prior art to determine whether the patent was valid and infringed. 

In the first case, Cameron's patent for a cleaning aid was found to be invalid due to its similarity to prior art patents and publications. The court concluded that the patent did not involve any exceptional imaginative talent, but rather involved mere mechanical skill. The court cited Justice Jackson's observation in Sinclair & Carroll Co., Inc. v. Interchemical Corporation, 325 U.S. 327, that " * * * Reading a list and selecting a known compound to meet known requirements is no more ingenious than selecting the last piece to put into the last opening in a jig-saw puzzle. It is not invention." (Reference: 325 U.S. 327, 65 S.Ct. 1143, 89 L.Ed. 1644)

In the second case, the court found that the patent for a cleaning aid was anticipated by a prior art patent and publication. The court concluded that the patent did not involve any new or non-obvious concepts, but rather involved the same general principles and devices as the prior art. The court cited the doctrine of anticipation in Dewey & Almy Chemical Co. v. Mimex Co., Inc., 2 Cir., 124 F.2d 986, which states that "No doctrine of the patent law is better established than that a prior patent or other publication to be an anticipation must bear within its four corners adequate directions for the practice of the patent invalidated." (Reference: 124 F.2d 986)

In the third case, the court found that the patent for a cleaning aid was invalid due to its similarity to prior art patents and publications. The court concluded that the patent did not involve any exceptional imaginative talent, but rather involved mere mechanical skill. The court cited the decision in Williams Mfg. Co. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 316 U. S. 364, which states that "Accepting, as we do, the findings below, we hold the patent valid and infringed." (Reference: 316 U. S. 364)

In conclusion, the courts in each case examined the patent claims and the prior art to determine whether the patent was valid and infringed. In each case, the court found that the patent did not involve any exceptional imaginative talent
