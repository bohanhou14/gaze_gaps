In determining the amount of attorney's fees, the court must consider several factors, including the hours expended by counsel, the reasonable value of counsel's time, the contingency of success, and the quality of the work performed. In this case, the court has already determined the lode star, which is the reasonable hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours worked. The court has also determined that the contingency factor should be 2, given the remote chance of success at the outset of the case.

The court must now consider the quality of the work performed. In Lindy II, the court held that the quality of the work should be considered separately from the contingency factor. In this case, the court agrees with the plaintiff's counsel that the quality of the work was excellent, and that the case was important and reached an important result. The court notes that the case was complicated and novel, and that the results were outstanding.

In determining the quality factor, the court will apply a multiplier of 1.5, making an additional allowance of 150% for this item. Adding this to the contingency factor of 2, the court arrives at a total hourly rate of $175. Applying this rate to the lode star amount of $32,858.50, the court arrives at a total fee of $115,004.75.

The court notes that this fee is assessed under section 4 of the Clayton Act, which provides for treble damages and attorney's fees in antitrust cases. The court believes that this fee is reasonable given the complexity and importance of the case, and the excellent results achieved.

In conclusion, the court hereby grants the petition for counsel fees in the amount of $115,004.75, plus costs and expenses in the amount of $2807.54. The court believes that this fee is reasonable and just, and that it is in the public interest to encourage counsel to undertake contingent litigation of this nature.

gold_text: Considering the fact that some antitrust suits lead to abnormally small amounts of recovery and yet in the public interest should be undertaken by counsel, it is evident that in many cases the fee allowed as reasonable will amount to more than the amount of recovery. It is also obvious that to allow a purely contingent fee would result in few counsel being interested in undertaking representation where the chance of recovery is poor and the amount to be recovered is so small even with a victory as not to justify the work. In Osborn v. Sinclair Refining Co., 207 F.Supp. 856 (D.C.Md. 1962) the amount of recovery was $975 and an attorney’s fee of $14,000 was awarded. This case was cited with approval in Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., 399 U.S. 222, 90 S.Ct. 1989, 26 L.Ed.2d 534 (1970). The Second Circuit has pointed out that a percentage of the recovery is not satisfactory in cases involving a small recovery because it gives undue weight to the size of the recovery and leads to too large a percentage where the recovery is large. See TWA Inc. v. Hughes, 312 F.Supp. 478 (S.D.N.Y. 1970) aff’d 449 F.2d 51 (2d Cir. 1971) reversed on other grounds 409 U.S. 363, 93 S.Ct. 647, 34 L.Ed.2d 577 (1973). An amount larger than the recovery was allowed in Lockton v. Day Glo Color Corp., 378 F.Supp. 23 (D.C.Ill.1974). Finally in Morning Pioneer Inc. v. Bismarck Tribune Co., 493 F.2d 383 (8th Cir. 1974) it was held that where the amount of recovery is small, attorney’s fees in excess of the award may be granted.
