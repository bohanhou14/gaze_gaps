In the case at hand, Chase argues that it did not violate the automatic stay provisions under 11 U.S.C. § 362(a) as its actions were legally permissible under the Bankruptcy Code. Reference case 457 F.3d 561 sets a relevant precedent by clarifying that certain post-petition transfers of mortgage interest do not violate the automatic stay, as the property interest being transferred does not belong to the debtor. Here, Chase's actions involved transferring its interest in the Corderos' mortgage, which aligns with this precedent.

Moreover, the case of Kapila v. Atlantic Mortgage & Investment Corp., 184 F.3d 1335, further supports this position by holding that a mortgage interest may be transferred post-petition, as the property owner holds only legal title, not an equitable interest. Chase’s actions, which involved reporting the default and collecting mortgage insurance from the FHA, mirror this scenario as they pertained solely to enforcing its own equitable interest and did not interfere with the debtors' legal rights over their property.

Additionally, considering the ruling in In re Smith, 14 B.R. 956, where the court held that a creditor's actions against a codebtor did not violate the automatic stay, Chase's conduct in addressing the default and insurance collection from the FHA should be similarly viewed as permissible.

For all these reasons, the allegations by the Corderos lack sufficient legal basis to support the default judgment for sanctions against Chase. Therefore, as the bankruptcy court’s decision conflicts with established precedents, its order granting sanctions is vacated.

gold_text: After a thorough review of the case law, I cannot find any basis for finding a violation of the automatic stay on the record before me. Chase did not violate the stay by transferring the Corderos’ mortgage after the bankruptcy filing. See In re Cook, 457 F.3d 561, 568 (6th Cir.2006) (citing Kapila v. Atlantic Mortgage & Investment Corp., 184 F.3d 1335, 1337 (11th Cir.1999)). Chase did not violate the stay by communicating a default to the FHA, where the purpose of the communication was simply to obtain repayment from a third-party guarantor. Cf. In re Colon, 212 B.R. 23, 25 (Bkrtcy.D.Puerto Rico 1997) (failure of a higher education corporation to remove a default notation from debtor’s record upon the filing of a bankruptcy or the confirmation of the plan “was a communication that the debtor had an uncured default” and did not violate the automatic stay). And Chase did not violate the stay by collecting from a third-party “guarantor” of the Corderos’ mortgage debt. See Lynch v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 710 F.2d 1194, 1196-97 (6th Cir.1983) (“[i]t is universally acknowledged that an automatic stay of proceedings accorded by § 362 may not be invoked by entities such as sureties, guarantors, co-obligors, or others with a similar legal or factual nexus to the ... debtor”); In re Smith, 14 B.R. 956, 957 (Bkrtcy.D.Conn.1981) (student loan creditor did not violate automatic stay by putting guarantor on notice of the plaintiffs default and requesting payment from guarantor in accordance with their loan guarantee agreement). In sum, the Corderos have not submitted any case law, and I have not found any either, in which a creditor was sanctioned for violating the automatic stay under the circumstances present in this case. I do not doubt that Chase’s actions made it more difficult (or impossible) for the Corderos to obtain a second guaranty from the FHA, or that Chase could have improved the Corderos’ prospects for reorganization by declining to make a claim against the mortgage insurance policy. Anytime a creditor, such as Chase, seeks repayment from a third party surety or guarantor, such as the FHA, the third party is less likely to guaranty the debtor’s future debts. But the fact that the debtor can no longer obtain a guaranty from that third party, is no fault of the collecting creditor, and cannot be held a sanctionable interference with the debtor’s property. As explained by the Fourth Circuit in Credit Alliance Corp. v. Williams, 851 F.2d 119, 121-22 (4th Cir.1988), a primary rationale for refusing to extend the automatic stay to nonbankrupt third parties is to insure that creditors obtain “the protection they sought and received when they required a third party to guaranty the debt.”
