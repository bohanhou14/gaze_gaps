Finally, we draw upon relevant precedent to support our conclusion on qualified immunity. In DeVargas v. Mason & Hanger-Silas Mason Co., the court held that private parties acting under a governmental contract were entitled to qualified immunity when the right in question was not clearly established (844 F.2d 714, 727-28). Similarly, Ms. Lopez acted under her role within a governmental agency, and there was no clearly established right to disability accommodation under the Equal Protection Clause at the relevant time.

Additionally, in Jantz v. Muci, the court noted that a defendant must do more than allege the violation of a general legal standard; there must be specific, established precedents that make the unlawfulness of the conduct apparent (976 F.2d 623, 627). Given the absence of specific, analogous precedents demonstrating that Ms. Lopez's conduct violated a clearly established right, her claim for qualified immunity stands.

Therefore, based on the applicable jurisprudence and the referenced cases, we conclude that Ms. Lopez is entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's denial of her motion for summary judgment.

gold_text: Against the existing legal backdrop, Ms. Lopez would have had little reason to expect a court to regard denial of accommodation to Mr. Ragsdell as unconstitutional under the rational-basis standard. See DeVargas v. Mason & Hanger-Silas Mason Co., 844 F.2d 714, 725 (10th Cir.1988) (holding that a prospective employer was entitled to qualified immunity in part because of the absence of any decision that a regulatory classification based on a disability (vision in only one eye) lacked a rational basis); see also Jantz v. Muci, 976 F.2d 623, 630 (10th Cir.1992).
