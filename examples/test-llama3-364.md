The cases referenced are 326 U.S. 88 and 500 F.2d 1078, which deal with issues of racial discrimination and equal protection.

In the case of 326 U.S. 88, the Railway Mail Association was accused of discriminating against minority groups by not allowing them to participate in the association. The court ruled that the association was not required to admit minority members, as long as the decision was not based on racial discrimination.

In the case of 500 F.2d 1078, the court ruled that a housing authority's plan to integrate public housing did not violate the Fair Housing Act. The plan provided for the allocation of housing units based on racial and ethnic diversity, and the court found that it did not discriminate against any group.

In this case, the defendants are accused of discriminating against white applicants by not allowing them to participate in the housing selection process. However, the plan provides for the allocation of housing units based on racial and ethnic diversity, and the court finds that it does not discriminate against any group.

Therefore, the court rules that the defendants' plan does not violate the Fair Housing Act, and the plaintiffs' claims are dismissed.

gold_text: All of the housing developments in South Boston are “racially imbalanced”, defined as less than ten percent non-white. Consequently whites are not given the opportunity to act as “minority preference applicants” for BHA housing developments located in South Boston. This appears to be the gravamen of plaintiffs’ complaint. However, there is no federally protected right to housing in a particular community, an allegation which lies at the essence of plaintiffs’ action. Nor may plaintiffs attempt to keep members of another racial group from entering the community. Railway Mail Association v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, 65 S.Ct. 1483, 89 L.Ed. 2072 (1945). Plaintiffs are not prevented from obtaining all housing in the South Boston community as a result of the operation of the Plan. And clearly there is no federally protected right to low income public housing. Acevedo v. Nassau County, 500 F.2d 1078 (2d Cir. 1974). Discriminatory effect cannot be established with reference to a single community.
