In asserting that the seizure of his truck and subsequent inventory search were conducted improperly, Thompson overlooks established legal precedents validating such actions under certain conditions. In Cooper v. California, 386 U.S. 58 (1967), the Court held that warrantless searches of vehicles, when seized according to state law for forfeiture, are reasonable. Similarly, the inventory search was consistent with established procedures, as seen in Florida v. Meyers, 466 U.S. 380 (1984), and Michigan v. Thomas, 458 U.S. 259 (1982).

Moreover, the $3,400 in cash found on Thompson’s person during his arrest was properly admitted into evidence. Based on information provided by Maxey, the police had sufficient probable cause to arrest Thompson, satisfying the standards set forth in Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31 (1979). 

It is clear from the evidence—Thompson’s control of the vehicle used in the drug transaction and previous convictions—that Thompson possessed the intent to distribute the cocaine. This aligns with the findings in United States v. LaGuardia, 774 F.2d 317 (8th Cir.1985), where the possession of controlled substances, cash, and paraphernalia implied intent to distribute. Thompson’s case similarly demonstrates constructive possession and intent, supported by the precedents cited (841 F.2d 837, 849 F.2d 1090).

Thus, the court rightly affirmed the actions taken during Thompson's arrest and the evidence obtained therein.

gold_text: The admissibility of the $3,400, however, hinges not on the validity of the arrest, but on the currency’s relationship to the arrest. Thompson was subsequently indicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and distribution of cocaine. Thus, establishing Thompson’s intent to distribute was essential to the government’s case at trial. This Court has consistently held that intent to distribute may be proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence and may be inferred from such things as large quantities of drugs, large sums of unexplained currency, and the presence of firearms. United States v. Matra, 841 F.2d 837 (8th Cir.1988); United States v. Shurn, 849 F.2d 1090, 26 Fed.R.Evid.Serv. 123 (8th Cir.1988). Thompson’s innocent explanation for the presence of this money was rejected by the court and jury below. We shall do likewise.
