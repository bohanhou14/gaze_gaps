We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment for the Government. In Ochran v. United States, 117 F.3d 495, 504 n. 6 (11th Cir. 1997), we explicitly stated that Rushing must allege a violation of state law duty in order to succeed under the FTCA. Here, Rushing failed to provide specific facts to support his claim that the BOP failed to provide him with health care comparable to that available in the community, when the BOP decided to delay his necessary ankle surgery.

Furthermore, the district court correctly applied the modified rule for medical malpractice claims, as stated in Diaz v. United States, 165 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir. 1999). According to this rule, a claim accrues when the plaintiff is, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should be, aware of both his injury and its connection with some act of the defendant. In this case, Rushing was aware of the need for surgery as early as October 2002, but the BOP's decision to delay the surgery was made on January 23, 2003. Therefore, Rushing should have been aware of both his injury and its connection with the BOP's deferral of surgery no earlier than January 23, 2003.

Additionally, the district court properly applied the FTCA's statute of limitations, as stated in Dalrymple v. United States, 460 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir. 2006). Rushing's December 30, 2004, complaint was filed within two years of January 23, 2003, and thus was not untimely.

In conclusion, the district court's grant of summary judgment for the Government is affirmed. Rushing failed to provide specific facts to support his claim, and his claim was timely filed under the FTCA's statute of limitations.

gold_text: With respect to Rushing’s medical malpractice and negligence claim, it must be determined which state’s law applies. Lia bility under the FTCA for “personal injury caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government,” should be determined “in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.” 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1); see also Ochran v. United States, 273 F.3d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir.2001). Because the United States is the defendant, the FTCA “requires that the ‘whole law of the State where the act or omission occurred!,]’ including its choice of law rules, be applied.” Gonzalez-Jiminez De Ruiz v. United States, 378 F.3d 1229, 1230 n. 1 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted). As Rushing was in Mississippi on January 23, 2003, when he possessed the critical facts of his injury and its cause, Mississippi’s choice of law rules provisions apply. See id. In this case, under its choice of law provisions, Mississippi would apply its own substantive law. See Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Goodwin, 920 So.2d 427, 432-33 (Miss. 2006).
