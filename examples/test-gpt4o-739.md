To resolve this issue, we must turn to legal precedents. In United States v. Merriam, 263 U.S. 179, the Supreme Court stated, "In statutes levying taxes the literal meaning of the words employed is most important, for such statutes are not to be extended by implication beyond the clear import of the language used." This highlights the importance of adhering strictly to the statutory language in tax matters. Furthermore, the Merriam case also states that "If the words are doubtful, the doubt must be resolved against the government and in favor of the taxpayer" (136 F.2d 303).

Additionally, in Bowers v. N. Y. & Albany Co., 281 U.S. 489, the Court held that tax statutes, including provisions of limitation, should be construed liberally in favor of the taxpayer. This supports the argument that the reduction of equity invested capital should be based on fair market value rather than cost, as the latter interpretation could lead to a harsher outcome for the taxpayer.

Therefore, considering these rulings, it is evident that any ambiguity in the statute should benefit the taxpayer, making it reasonable to argue that the reduction in equity invested capital should be based on the fair market value of the property distributed.

Merriam, 263 U.S. 179, 188, 44 S.Ct. 69, 71, 68 L.Ed. 240. And, as was stated by this court in Durkee Famous Foods, Inc., v. Harrison, 136 F.2d 303, 307, “Another rule often overlooked in construing a revenue statute is that in a doubtful situation the taxpayer is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.” See also: United States v. Updike, 281 U.S. 489, 496, 50 S.Ct. 367, 74 L.Ed. 984.
