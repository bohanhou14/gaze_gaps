KAREN LECRAFT HENDERSON, Circuit Judge:
NIMJ appeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment regarding the nineteen documents deemed exempt under FOIA Exemption 5. As established, Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums not available by law to parties in litigation with the agency. Our circuit precedent allows for a broad application of this exemption. In United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., and NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Supreme Court has emphasized Exemption 5's goal to protect the deliberative process of government agencies (421 U.S. 132).

NIMJ challenges the application, citing Department of the Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532 U.S. 1 (2001), arguing that the documents are not "intra-agency" communications. However, our circuit precedent, which includes cases like Ryan v. Department of Justice, 617 F.2d 781, and Formaldehyde Inst. v. HHS, 889 F.2d 1118, clarifies that documents submitted by outside consultants in response to agency requests qualify as intra-agency for Exemption 5 purposes. In Ryan, this court determined that deliberative materials from external consultants, solicited by the agency, are protected as intra-agency documents even if the contributors are not formal employees (617 F.2d at 789-90).

In conclusion, our established jurisprudence affirms the deliberative process protection, ensuring candid advisement essential for agency decision-making. Thus, we uphold the district court’s decision, affirming that the nineteen documents in question are exempt under FOIA Exemption 5.

gold_text: . There is no dispute that the withheld documents satisfy the second requirement in Exemption 5 — that they be "unavailable by law" under one of the established civil discovery privileges — here, under the "deliberative process” privilege. See Dep’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532 U.S. 1, 8-9, 121 S.Ct. 1060, 149 L.Ed.2d 87 (2001). To qualify for Exemption 5 protection under the deliberative process privilege, "an agency's materials must be both 'predecisional' and a part of the 'deliberative process.’ ” Formaldehyde Inst. v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 889 F.2d 1118, 1121 (D.C.Cir.1989) (citing NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 151-52, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975)). The withheld documents are plainly both.
