**Generation:**

In addressing Kogaku's argument, we find that legislative intent supports the classification of Slit-Lamp Microscopes under item 709.05 TSUS. As noted in the Tariff Classification Study and its commentary, the intended scope of item 709.05 covered specialized medical instruments, including ophthalmic devices such as the Slit-Lamp Microscope. The exclusionary phrase in headnote l(ii) does not disrupt this classification.

In previous cases, such as 426 F.2d 1308, courts have emphasized the importance of legislative intent and long-standing classification practices. Similarly, in 433 F.2d 1327, the court relied on historical context and the consistent application of tariff schedules.

Kogaku's reliance on the plain language of headnote l(ii) is insufficient to override this context. Legislative history demonstrates Congress' intent to classify specialized medical instruments, including the Slit-Lamp Microscope, under item 709.05 and not as general-purpose microscopes. Thus, the classification by the classifying official stands correct.

AFFIRMED.
