In the context of legal cases, it is essential to follow the guidelines and procedures outlined in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCP). In the case of a presentence report, Rule 32(c)(3)(D) requires that the court make a factual finding regarding the accuracy of the information contained in the report if a defendant challenges the report's accuracy.

In the case of United States v. McWilliams (909 F.2d 1443), the defendant argued that the government's evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The court disagreed, finding that the evidence was sufficient to show the defendant's conspiracy with other defendants to distribute cocaine base.

Another case that is relevant to this discussion is United States v. Forker (928 F.2d 365). In this case, the defendant argued that the search of his vehicle was unconstitutional because it was not based on probable cause. The court disagreed, finding that the search was justified by exigent circumstances.

In the context of a presentence report, it is essential to follow the guidelines outlined in FRCP Rule 32(c)(3)(D). This rule requires that the court make a factual finding regarding the accuracy of the information contained in the report if a defendant challenges the report's accuracy.

In conclusion, it is essential to follow the guidelines and procedures outlined in the FRCP, particularly in the context of a presentence report. The court must make a factual finding regarding the accuracy of the information contained in the report if a defendant challenges the report's accuracy.

gold_text: From the record before us it would appear that the district court did not make the findings or determinations required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D). In United States v. Alvarado, 909 F.2d 1443, 1445 (10th Cir.1990), decided after sentence was imposed in the instant case, we held that Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D) requires that when a defendant challenges information in his presentence report, the district court must either make a factual finding regarding the accuracy of the challenged information or expressly state that in imposing sentence he is not taking into consideration the challenged statement. In Alvarado, we remanded for resentencing, commenting that such findings or determinations must be made not only for use by the correctional system, but also so that “we know the facts upon which the district judge relie[d].” Id. at 1445. See also United States v. Forker, 928 F.2d 365 (11th Cir.1991) (citing Alvarado).
