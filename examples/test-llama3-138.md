The main issue in this case is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion to intervene by Mason and Ivy. They sought to intervene in the class action lawsuit to appeal the denial of class certification. The district court denied their motion, stating that it was untimely and that they failed to demonstrate that they had a substantial interest in the case.

In support of their position, Mason and Ivy argue that the Supreme Court's decision in United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385 (1977), supports their contention that their motion to intervene was timely. They argue that the critical inquiry is whether they acted promptly after the entry of final judgment, and that they filed their motion within the time period in which the named plaintiffs could have taken an appeal.

The district court, on the other hand, distinguished McDonald on the grounds that the named plaintiffs in this case did not seek an interlocutory appeal of the denial of class certification, and that Rule 23(f) has altered the procedure for interlocutory appeals of denials of class certification.

However, the Seventh Circuit has recognized that McDonald established the general rule that putative class members like Mason and Ivy can delay filing their motion to intervene to appeal the denial of certification of the class until the final judgment is entered. Larson v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 530 F.3d 578 (7th Cir. 2008).

In conclusion, the district court's decision to deny the motion to intervene by Mason and Ivy was an abuse of discretion. They demonstrated a substantial interest in the case and acted promptly after the entry of final judgment. The decision in United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385 (1977), supports their contention that their motion to intervene was timely. Therefore, we REVERSE the district court's decision and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

gold_text: In addition, Baptist and Methodist argue that the district court did not err in applying McDonald because this court previously considered the decision in determining that Bachelder’s motion to intervene was untimely, and Mason’s and Ivy’s attempt to distinguish their purpose in intervening from Bachelder’s “gets them nowhere.” The defendants contend that Ivy and Mason cannot avoid the same analysis “by narrowly defining their interest as limited to appealing the denial of class certification.” Neither McDonald nor subsequent decisions from this circuit bear this principle out. McDonald explicitly recognized that unnamed plaintiffs may intervene “for the purpose of appeal,” including for the purpose of appealing a denial of class certification. 432 U.S. at 395, 97 S.Ct. 2464 (emphasis added); see also Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U.S. 301, 303-04, 108 S.Ct. 586, 98 L.Ed.2d 629 (1988) (per curiam) (recognizing that a non-party may intervene for the limited purpose of taking an appeal); Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345, 348 n. 1, 103 S.Ct. 2392, 76 L.Ed.2d 628 (1983) (same). We have also recently reaffirmed that Rule 24 permits “limited-in-scope intervention,” including intervention “for the limited purpose of appeal.” United States v. City of Detroit, 712 F.3d 925, 931-32 (4th Cir.2013) (citing McDonald, 432 U.S. at 394, 97 S.Ct. 2464). The purpose of intervention is a substantial factor to consider in making a timeliness determination, and an individual’s limited purpose in intervening may make an otherwise inexcusable delay reasonable under the circumstances. See Stupak-Thrall v. Glickman, 226 F.3d 467, 479 n. 15 (6th Cir.2000) (noting that courts should consider “whether the lack of an earlier motion to intervene should be excused, given the proposed intervenor’s purpose,” as “when [a] proposed intervenor seeks to intervene late in the litigation to ensure an appeal” (emphasis added)).
