Petitioner’s failure to request a mistrial during his initial trial, despite being acutely aware of the prosecutor’s conduct during the cross-examination of Webb, significantly undermines his current allegation of intentional misconduct designed to provoke a mistrial. This situation mirrors the findings in United States v. Leonard, 593 F.2d 951, 954 (10th Cir.), where the court concluded that mere bad faith, without substantial provocation leading to a mistrial request, does not elevate to the level barring retrial (referenced in 637 F.2d 728).

Moreover, the trial judge's determination post-trial, which did not immediately recognize the necessity for a mistrial, parallels the findings in United States v. Curtis, 683 F.2d 769, where conduct, although improper, did not evidently necessitate a mistrial. Consequently, the appellate support for the trial record’s sufficiency to retry petitioner without double jeopardy considerations aligns with the precedent that does not automatically preclude subsequent retrial, as in Curtis.

Furthermore, the appellate procedural dismissal in the prior state rulings (refer to 735 F.2d 684) without detailed fact-finding on the prosecutor's intent further supports the view that the mistrial request's basis was not inherently warranted by the prosecutor’s alleged misconduct. Hence, the consistent absence of direct findings or procedural motions for a mistrial fortifies the trial court's presumption under § 2254, thereby justifying the denial of the habeas corpus petition.

gold_text: The court also finds it significant that the trial judge did not declare a mistrial. Even absent a motion from petitioner, the trial judge certainly would have declared a mistrial if he determined the prosecutor was intentionally conducting improper cross-examination in order to get a mistrial. Respondents argue that because the trial court did not declare a mistrial, this case is markedly dissimilar to Kennedy, in which the trial judge did order a mistrial. Respondents maintain that the ruling in Kennedy should not be extended to situations where, as here, the case is reversed for prosecutorial misconduct; they argue that a double jeopardy claim under Kennedy should be available only where the trial court declares a mistrial. The court rejects respondents’ position. Adopting respondents’ interpretation of Kennedy would make a defendant’s constitutional right to claim double jeopardy dependent on whether the trial court correctly recognizes that a mistrial is in order — a fact wholly outside the power of the defendant. This court, in accord with other courts discussing the issue, fails to see any justification for such a rule. See United States v. Rios, 637 F.2d 728, 729 (10th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 918, 101 S.Ct. 3054, 69 L.Ed.2d 422 (1981); Petrucelli v. Smith, 544 F.Supp. 627, 632-33 (W.D.N.Y.1982), rev’d on other grounds, 735 F.2d 684 (2d Cir.1984). See also United States v. Curtis, 683 F.2d 769, 774-75 (3rd Cir.) (favorably discussing the Rios and Petrucelli approach), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1018, 103 S.Ct. 379, 74 L.Ed.2d 512 (1982). Therefore, the court finds that the trial judge’s failure to declare a mistrial does not preclude petitioner’s double jeopardy claim based on intentional prosecutorial misconduct.
