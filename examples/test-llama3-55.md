 ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

After reviewing the cases of 200 F.3d 1337, 120 F.3d 205, and 50 F.3d 962, I conclude that the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment should be granted.

Firstly, with regards to the FLSA retaliation claim, the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of retaliation. According to Richmond v. ONEOK, Inc., 120 F.3d 205, a prima facie case of FLSA retaliation requires a demonstration by the plaintiff of the following: (1) she engaged in activity protected under [the] act; (2) she subsequently suffered adverse action by the employer; and (3) a causal connection existed between the employee’s activity and the adverse action. In this case, the Plaintiffs failed to show that their protected activity (i.e., signing the letters) was the cause of their termination.

Furthermore, the Plaintiffs’ claim under Title 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3) is also unpersuasive. According to Reich v. Davis, 50 F.3d 962, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the adverse action would not have been taken “but for” the assertion of FLSA rights. Here, the Plaintiffs failed to show that their termination was the direct result of their assertion of FLSA rights.

In conclusion, based on the cases of 200 F.3d 1337, 120 F.3d 205, and 50 F.3d 962, I grant the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. The Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of FLSA retaliation and their claim under Title 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3) is unpersuasive.

gold_text: Ultimately Plaintiffs fail to make a case for retaliatory discharge under the FLSA, regardless of whether they hinge their claim upon the letters they signed in 2003 or the letters they signed and submitted in 2005. In both cases, Plaintiffs cannot meet the elements required to establish a prima facie case under 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3). Under the statute, it is unlawful for any person “to discharge or in any other matter discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this Act [29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding or has served or is about to serve on an industry committee.” 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3). In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3), Plaintiffs must demonstrate that (1) they engaged in activity protected under the act; (2) they suffered adverse action by the employer, and (3) a causal connection existed between the employee’s activity and the adverse action. Wolf v. Coca-Cola Company, 200 F.3d 1337, 1342-43 (11th Cir.2000) (citing Richmond v. ONEOK, Inc., 120 F.3d 205, 208-09 (10th Cir.1997)). If the Defendant is able to present a valid reason for terminating the Plaintiffs’ employment, then the Plaintiff may attempt to show that the proffered reason is pretextual in nature. See id. Furthermore, in demonstrating causation, the plaintiff must prove that the adverse action would not have been taken “but for” the assertion of FLSA rights. See Reich v. Davis, 50 F.3d 962, 965-66 (11th Cir.1995).
