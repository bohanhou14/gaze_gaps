In addressing the compliance requirement of reinstatement and back pay awards, it is pertinent to consider precedent case law. The Sixth Circuit in *N.L.R.B. v. Interurban Gas Co.*, 354 F.2d 76, 78 (C.A.6) emphasized the necessity of good faith compliance with such awards. Similarly, the Third Circuit in *Lakeland Bus Lines, Inc. v. N.L.R.B.*, 278 F.2d 888, 892 (C.A.3), stated that reinstatement must be executed in good faith to meet legal standards.

In our present case, the Railroad's attempts to reinstate Choate do not meet the criteria of good faith compliance. The offer to reinstate him to a distant and essentially unavailable position cannot be considered a genuine effort to restore him to his former or an equivalent position with back pay, as dictated by precedent. As per *Interurban Gas Co.*, 354 F.2d at 78, and *Lakeland Bus Lines*, 278 F.2d at 892, such practices amount to a sham compliance and do not fulfill the legal obligations under the award.

Therefore, we find that the district court rightly ordered full enforcement of the Public Law Board's decision, including Choate’s reinstatement to a suitable position with back pay. The Railroad's conduct, as demonstrated, fails to conform to the principles of good faith required for legitimate compliance. Consequently, the district court’s judgment is affirmed based on these findings.
