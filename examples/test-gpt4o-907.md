We review the district court's restitution determination for clear error. See United States v. Oslund, 453 F.3d 1048, 1062 (8th Cir. 2006) (citing reference case 501 F.3d 888). Defendants argue that the district court erred in fixing the child’s restitution award at $200,000. The court’s calculation must be based on a preponderance of the evidence, as emphasized in United States v. Vanhorn, 344 F.3d 729, 731 (8th Cir. 2003) (citing reference case 376 F.3d 806).

While defendants contest the speculative nature of Dr. Gentry's testimony, the district court acted within its discretion in determining an award deemed necessary for future psychological services. Restitution needs to correspond closely to actual damages sustained — see Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 413 (1990) — thus, it is imperative the calculation genuinely reflects the victim's anticipated expenses.

Moreover, the court’s obligation under the MVRA mandates restitution that ensures comprehensive restoration of the victim's state, as observed in reference case 541 F.3d 838. Here, the record supports a $200,000 award as it realistically compensates projected counseling costs, balancing between necessary restitution and avoidance of speculative elements.

Consequently, considering the evidence and statutory guidelines, the district court did not commit clear error in awarding $200,000 in restitution to the child. The court’s careful evaluation and adjustments of the restitution confirm its adherence to a reasoned approach and legal standards.
