The case at hand involves an appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, dismissing the original and amended petitions for habeas corpus filed by appellant, Marcos Perez Jimenez, and discharging the original and amended orders to show cause issued on the petitions for habeas corpus. The case is referenced as 311 F.2d 547.

The appellant, a former president of Venezuela, is seeking to overturn the judgment of the district court, which found him guilty of failing to pay manufacturer's excise taxes on imported automobiles. The court found that the evidence presented by the government showed that the appellant had been informed of his duty to pay the taxes and had failed to do so.

The issue before the court is whether the appellant's application for bond pending appeal should be granted. The court must consider the factors set forth in Rule 46 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, including the ability of the defendant to give bail, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the penalty imposed, the character and reputation of the defendant, and the probability that the defendant will appear or flee.

In determining whether to grant bail, the court must also consider the weight of the evidence against the defendant and the defendant's past history and activities. In this case, the court found that the evidence against the defendant was substantial and that he had a history of defying the laws of the United States.

In light of these factors, the court concludes that bail in the amount of $75,000.00 is reasonable and necessary to assure the defendant's presence. The defendant is amply able to provide this bond merely by bringing his money out of hiding.

The court's decision is supported by the case of United States v. Esters, 255 F.2d 63, which held that the court should resolve any doubts in favor of the defendant. Similarly, the case of United States v. Schneiderman, 106 F.Supp. 941, held that bail should be equivalent to the amount necessary to insure the presence of the defendant to fulfill the sentence imposed.

In conclusion, the court grants the appellant's application for bond pending appeal in the amount of $75,000.00. The defendant is required to post this bond to assure his presence at all future proceedings.
