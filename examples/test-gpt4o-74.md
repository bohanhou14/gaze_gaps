The district court found that Mr. Brunson’s role as president of Consolidated Services Corporation did not equate to a position of trust vis-a-vis the Russian Coal Company. This determination aligns with established jurisprudence that an abuse of trust enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 requires the defendant’s position to significantly facilitate the offense through trust placed by the victim (4 F.3d 925). Furthermore, Mr. Brunson’s argument that he merely portrayed a semblance of legitimacy, hence not occupying a genuine position of trust, resonates with the principles laid out in United States v. Lowder, where the use of authority and the absence of oversight defined the clear abuse of such trust (5 F.3d 467).

In light of these precedents, Mr. Brunson did not possess a fiduciary or authoritative role that would substantiate a § 3B1.3 enhancement. His actions, instead, embody the conduct of an external fraudster rather than an insider exploiting privileged access or reliance. Consequently, the application of the two-point enhancement for abuse of a position of trust is reversed, consistent with the statutory interpretation and case law guiding the proper constraints of this sentencing enhancement.

gold_text: As the application note to § 3B1.3 indicates, the other type of case where an enhancement under § 3B1.3 is proper is where a fiduciary or personal trust relationship exists. For example, in United States v. Queen, 4 F.3d 925 (10th Cir.1993), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 114 S.Ct. 1230, 127 L.Ed.2d 575 (1994), we upheld an enhancement for the president of a company who had claimed to be an investment advisor/broker and had solicited funds which he had diverted for his personal use. He covered up his diversion by sending phony profit statements to the investors. Clearly, his position provided him with “the freedom to commit a difficult-to-detect wrong,” one of the essential factors in the test for abuse of trust. United States v. Williams, 966 F.2d at 557. Furthermore, the district court had specifically found that a fiduciary relationship existed between the defendant and his “clients.” Id. at 927. Similarly, in United States v. Lowder, 5 F.3d 467 (10th Cir.1993), an accountant personally solicited investments from his tax clients, fraudulently promising them a guaranteed twelve percent return; the funds he then diverted to his personal use. As president of the company, he was able to dispose of the investors’ money without oversight. These cases are closer to the ease at bar in that they involve presidents of companies who defrauded others. Despite this similarity, these cases do not support an “abuse of trust” enhancement for Mr. Brunson.
