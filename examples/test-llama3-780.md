In this case, the court must determine whether the restrictive covenant in the lease agreement is illegal under federal and state antitrust laws. The covenant prohibits the lessor from leasing or selling space to another food super market within the shopping center or within 2,500 feet of the demised premises owned and controlled by the lessor.

The court notes that the federal antitrust statutes, specifically Section 1 of the Sherman Act, prohibit contracts, combinations, or conspiracies that restrain trade or commerce among the several states. However, the court finds that the restrictive covenant in this case is not in violation of the Sherman Act because it does not restrain trade or commerce among the several states.

In Wham-O-Mfg. Co. v. Hogan, 328 F.2d 300, the court held that a district court has discretion to dismiss a non-federal claim without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to bring suit on that claim in a state court. This case is similar in that the court finds that the dismissal of the federal claim would be useless waste of energy and that the court should exercise its discretion to dismiss the non-federal claim.

Furthermore, the court notes that the restraint in intrastate commerce in this case does not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. In Mandeville Island Farms v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219, the court held that a restraint in intrastate commerce falls within the prohibitions of the Sherman Act only if it has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

In conclusion, the court finds that the restrictive covenant in the lease agreement is not in violation of federal antitrust laws and that the dismissal of the federal claim was proper. The court also finds that the non-federal claim should be dismissed without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to bring suit on that claim in a state court.

gold_text: The court is urged to assume pendent jurisdiction. While the dismissal of a federal claim does not automatically remove jurisdiction in a federal court to hear a state claim, the exercise of jurisdiction is nonetheles in the sound discretion of the court. Sunbeam Lighting Co. v. Pacific Associated Lighting Inc., 328 F.2d 300 (9th Cir. 1964). The court should consider whether the federal claim is substantial at least to the extent that it can overcome a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and whether the federal and state claims arise out of the same operative facts. In re Union National Bank & Trust Co. of Souderton, Pa., 298 F.Supp. 422 (E.D. Pa.1969); Edward J. Moriarty & Co. v. General Tire & Rubber Co., 289 F.Supp. 381 (S.D.Ohio 1967); Robinson & Sons Inc. v. Mister Donut of America Inc., 270 F.Supp. 99 (D.Mass.1967). Amere adverse decision on the merits of the federal claim does not mean that it is insubstantial. Hurn v. Oursler, 289 U.S. 238, 53 S.Ct. 586, 77 L.Ed. 1148 (1933). However it would appear that in a case such as at bar where the federal claim cannot withstand a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, it is not substantial in the sense of dictating that the court accept pendent jurisdiction. If the federal claim here were considered substantial, then an aggrieved party could sue in federal court any time based on state claims by merely asserting that the Sherman Act is violated.
