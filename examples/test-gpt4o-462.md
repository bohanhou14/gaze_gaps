**Generation:**

In consideration of the precedents and the relevant statutory framework, we must turn our attention to the critical analysis provided by prior case law. Notably, the determination in Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, 314 U.S. 244, and its subsequent discussions in reference case 317 U.S. 249, emphasizes the complexity of jurisdictional lines between state and federal oversight regarding employment-related injuries on navigable waters. The "twilight zone" concept elucidated in these cases highlights that specific factual contexts are paramount in rendering decisions.

Further grounding our examination is reference case 281 U.S. 222, which reversed a lower court's judgment, underscoring the necessity of consistent alignment with statutory interpretations and higher court precedents. The nuanced intersection of the Federal Employers' Liability Act and the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act remains a contentious arena.

Thus, while the plaintiff contends, based on the Zientek reasoning, that the 1939 amendment to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act implicitly repeals the Nogueira ruling, it is imperative to consider the rigorous interpretations in conflicting cases such as Job v. Erie R. Co., 79 F.Supp. 698. The prevailing sentiment underscores that congressional intent clarified by the 1939 amendment does not unequivocally overturn the foundational principles laid out in Nogueira.

Therefore, despite the broader coverage intended by the Federal Employers’ Liability Act post-amendment, the exclusivity of the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act as established in precedent remains persuasive. Consequently, given the clear, uncontroverted facts of the plaintiff’s employment and accident circumstances, the motion to dismiss based on the established legal framework is substantiated.

gold_text: The brief for the plaintiff suggests that the Nogueira case is capable of being distinguished because the plaintiff there was a freight handler (“longshoreman”), whereas in the case at bar he is a brakeman (“railroader”). I think what plaintiff’s counsel really hints at is that the traditional maritime tort-jurisdiction test (locality) has become outmoded, and that the nature of the employment should be a substitute or perhaps an alternative test. In fact, plaintiff cites Davis v. De partment of Labor and Industries of the State of Washington, 1942, 317 U.S. 249, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246, as pointing the way to a twilight zone in the decisions and a “case by case” technique, 317 U.S. 249, 256, 63 S.Ct. 225, 229, 87 L.Ed. 246. But there is nothing in the 1939 amendment to suggest that Congress was changing the locality test found in the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act. As for the Davis case, the Supreme Court there found itself dealing with another complication arising from the “maritime but local” doctrine by which it had attempted to retreat from the harshness of the Jensen case prior to the enactment of the federal compensation act. Mr. Justice Black cites many of these “maritime but local” decisions in a footrSte in Davis, 317 U.S. 249, 253, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246. But although that footnote mentions Nogueira, as does the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the dissent of Mr. Chief Justice Stone, I find no suggestion in the Nogueira opinion that it was in any way affected by the “maritime but local” exception. Indeed one of the leading decisions, Baizley Iron Works v. Span, 1930, 281 U.S. 222, 50 S.Ct. 306, 74 L.Ed. 819, where the nature of employment (“local”) test was vainly invoked to escape the Jensen decision, came down on the very same day as the Nogueira decision (April 14, 1930). Nowhere in Nogueira is the Baizley decision spoken of; nowhere in Baizley is Nogueira mentioned. Justices Holmes, Stone and Brandéis dissented in Baizley, but they concurred in Nogueira.
