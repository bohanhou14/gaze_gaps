**Generation:**

We find analogous support for our decision in **Lewis v. Penn Central Railroad**, 526 F.2d 470. There, the court emphasized the need for proper evidentiary standards and the importance of adequate objections during trial to preserve issues for appeal. Janeway's failure to object during the trial mirrors the appellant's shortcomings in Lewis, where the court held that strategic decisions by counsel do not amount to manifest injustice. 

Moreover, similar to **Singh's** case in 628 F.2d 758, this court highlighted that appellate review requires the evidence to be viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, disregarding any conflicting inferences. Here, the district court's decision to charge the jury with October 1981 as the tender date was supported by adequate evidence and the strategic choices made at trial. 

Additionally, the trial court’s discretion in denying reopening the case for additional evidence parallels the findings in **Burks’s appeal**, 612 F.2d 690. The appellate court in Burks emphasized that the burden of providing mitigating evidence lies with the defendant, and failure to meet this burden, including lack of objection, does not constitute reversible error. 

Based on these precedents, we affirm the district court’s judgment.

gold_text: Janeway’s final argument is that the district court erred in allowing plaintiff Cauchie to invoke the Fifth Amendment in response to questions asked on cross-examination concerning his alleged non-payment of Belgian income taxes and in refusing to allow defense counsel to comment on Cauchie’s failure to testify. Here again, our scope of review is narrow. Limitations on the extent of cross-examination are left to the discretion of the trial judge. Lewis v. Baker, 526 F.2d 470, 475 (2d Cir. 1975). We are concerned only with whether the trial judge abused his discretion in controlling the cross-examination of Cauchie. Id. Only if the alleged error was prejudicial may we find it an adequate basis for reversal. United States v. Singh, 628 F.2d 758, 763 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1034, 101 S.Ct. 609, 66 L.Ed.2d 496 (1980). Cf. Dunbar v. Harris, 612 F.2d 690, 692-93 (2d Cir.1979).
