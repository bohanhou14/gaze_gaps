To address the issue of standing for the farmworker plaintiffs under Section 16 of the Clayton Act, the determining factor is whether they can demonstrate a proximate cause linking the alleged antitrust violations to their injury. As articulated in Reibert v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 471 F.2d 727, the pivotal issue is establishing a causal connection sufficient to show that the violations were a substantial factor in causing the injury. Furthermore, In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution M.D.L. No. 31, 518 F.2d 1129, suggests a less stringent standard for standing in cases seeking injunctive relief as opposed to treble damages, focusing on the threat of loss or damage.

The farmworker plaintiffs must allege that their injuries were proximately caused by the anti-competitive conduct, implying a direct link to the activities protected by antitrust laws, as underscored in Conference of Studio Unions v. Loew’s, Inc., 193 F.2d 51. They must show they are within the "target area" of the economic impact caused by the defendants' actions, which Section 16 aims to protect, effectively demonstrating the required injury in a commercial or competitive sense. This nuanced understanding underscores the necessity for plaintiffs to align their claims within the specific economic interests that the antitrust laws intend to safeguard.

gold_text: Section 16 deletes any requirement that a plaintiff be injured in his business or property in order to state a cause of action for antitrust violations. However, the plaintiff must show, among other things, “threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws.” 15 U.S.C. § 26 (emphasis added). This language requires a showing that the alleged significant threat of injury was proximately caused by the violations. See, e. g., Reibert v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 471 F.2d 727 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 938, 93 S.Ct. 1900, 36 L.Ed.2d 399 (1973). Those courts which have found causation lacking for injunctive relief have often spoken in terms of the remoteness of the injury from the allegedly violative activity. See, e. g., Jeffrey v. Southwestern Bell, 518 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir. 1975); Conference of Studio Unions v. Loew’s, Inc., 193 F.2d 51 (9th Cir. 1951), cert. denied, 342 U.S. 919, 72 S.Ct. 367, 96 L.Ed. 687 (1952).
