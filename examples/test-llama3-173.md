In the case of Christian v. State, 392 F.3d 284, David argued that his joinder with his codefendants for trial and the state trial court's decision not to sever his trial constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court in Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993). However, the court held that David's joinder with his codefendants for trial and the state trial court's decision not to sever his trial did not constitute an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court in Zafiro.

The court pointed out that the Supreme Court in Zafiro held that a district court should grant a severance under Rule 14 only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence. The court noted that in David's case, there was no evidence that the joint trial compromised his trial right or prevented the jury from making a reliable judgment about his guilt or innocence.

In fact, the court held that the trial court's decision not to sever David's trial was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court in Zafiro. The court pointed out that the Supreme Court in Zafiro did not elaborate on the statement that "a defendant might suffer prejudice if essential exculpatory evidence that would be available to a defendant tried alone were unavailable in a joint trial." Id. at 539, 113 S.Ct. 933. In addition, the court noted that the Supreme Court in Zafiro emphasized that the determination of risk of prejudice and any remedy that may be necessary to the sound discretion of the district courts. Id. at 541, 113 S.Ct. 933.

In conclusion, the court held that David's joinder with his codefendants for trial and the state trial court's decision not to sever his trial did not constitute an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court in Zafiro. The court pointed out that there was no evidence that the joint trial compromised David's trial right or prevented the jury from making a reliable judgment about his guilt or innocence. The court also noted that the Supreme Court in Zafiro emphasized

gold_text: In any event, we have held that a “district court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to sever absent a ‘firm representation’ that a co-defendant would be willing to testify on the defendant’s behalf.” United States v. Crumley, 528 F.3d 1053, 1063 (8th Cir.2008) (quoting United States v. Blaylock, 421 F.3d 758, 767 (8th Cir.2005)). David emphasizes that his attorney informed the state trial court at a pre-trial hearing that Scot and Powers “intimated that they would be prepared to testify for [David] based upon the facts leading up to this incident,” but this statement does not constitute a “firm representation” that they were actually willing to testify for David. See id. (“In his pretrial motion, [the defendant] neglected to offer a ‘firm representation’ that [his codefendant] was willing to testify, but simply stated that he would call [his codefendant] to testify and that her testimony would exculpate him. He offered no proof to the district court that [his codefendant] agreed to testify on [his] behalf.”) (footnote omitted). Similarly, the post-trial affidavits of Scot and Powers do not support David’s position because whether a state “court’s determination ‘resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States’ ” must be decided “in light of the record before it.” Nance v. Norris, 392 F.3d 284, 293 (8th Cir.2004) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1)). Even under our precedent, David’s claim would fail.
