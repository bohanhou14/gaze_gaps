The question before the Court is whether an anti-suit injunction should be granted to enjoin Luzuriaga from prosecuting his claims against ICBCSS in the Argentine Litigation. The power of federal courts to issue such injunctions is well-established, provided they are used sparingly and with great restraint. As observed in U.S. v. Davis, 767 F.2d 1025, 1038 (2d Cir.1985), injunctions against foreign suits are permissible when necessary to protect the court’s ability to render a just and final judgment.

Similarly, the aforementioned Laker Airways case, 731 F.2d 909, 926 (D.C.Cir.1984), reinforces that concurrent jurisdiction does not always lead to a conflict of laws, and courts should exercise caution to respect international comity. Further, in Canadian Filters (Harwich) v. Lear-Siegler, 412 F.2d 577, 578 (1st Cir.1969), it was emphasized that anti-suit injunctions should be employed only when absolutely necessary.

Here, the primary aim of ICBCSS is to prevent Luzuriaga from prosecuting the Argentine Litigation, potentially undermining this Court’s jurisdiction and ability to adjudicate the matter under New York law (Compl. ¶ 28). However, using an anti-suit injunction would contravene principles of international comity and might not prevent the Argentine Court from proceeding with the case, as noted in Peck v. Jenness, 48 U.S. 612, 625 (1849).

Considering these factors, coupled with the extraordinary nature of anti-suit injunctions, the Court finds it inappropriate to grant such relief in this instance. The parties must contest the applicability of Argentine or New York law within the framework of the Argentine legal system, ensuring respect for international judicial sovereignty.

Given these considerations, Plaintiff’s request for an anti-suit injunction is DENIED.

gold_text: In the alternative, the Court denies Plaintiffs request for an anti-suit injunction. The Second Circuit set forth its test for determining whether to enjoin foreign litigation in China Trade & Development Corp. v. M.V. Choong Yong, 837 F.2d 33 (2d Cir. 1987). The Court cautioned that “because such an order effectively restricts the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign, ... an anti-foreign-suit injunction should be ‘used sparingly.’” Id. at 35-36 (quoting United States v. Davis, 767 F.2d 1025, 1038 (2d Cir. 1985)).
