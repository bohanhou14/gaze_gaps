Based on the provided references, I will evaluate the situation and provide an answer.

In the context of bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor's false oath can lead to the denial of discharge. The references provided, specifically 9 B.R. 804 and 22 F.2d 282, highlight the importance of accuracy and honesty in the debtor's financial statements.

In the case at hand, the debtor's Statement of Financial Affairs was found to contain false information regarding the transfer of real estate to a third party. This false oath was deemed to be made "knowingly and fraudulently" within the meaning of § 727(a)(4)(A). The court noted that the debtor's failure to list the transfer was not due to mere mistake or inadvertence, but rather a reckless disregard for the serious nature of the information sought.

In reaching its conclusion, the court considered the purpose of § 727(a)(4)(A), which is to ensure that dependable information is supplied for those interested in administering the bankruptcy estate. The court also noted that the trustee and creditors are entitled to honest and accurate signposts on the trail showing what property has passed through the debtor's hands during the period prior to his bankruptcy.

In light of these references, it is clear that the debtor's false oath was material and sufficient to deny him a discharge. The court's decision was supported by the evidence presented, which showed that the debtor had knowingly and fraudulently made a false oath regarding the transfer of real estate.

In conclusion, the denial of discharge in this case was justified due to the debtor's false oath and reckless disregard for the accuracy of his financial statements. The references provided, 9 B.R. 804 and 22 F.2d 282, offer valuable insights into the importance of honesty and accuracy in bankruptcy proceedings.
