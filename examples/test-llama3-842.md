In the case of Association of Mexican-American Educators v. California, 231 F.3d 572, the court held that Title VII applies to the CBEST; that the CBEST was validated properly; and that the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to award costs to Defendants.

In the case of Technical Resource Servs. v. PSC, Inc., 229 F.3d 1012, the court held that a non-prevailing party's financial status is a factor that a district court may, but need not, consider in its award of costs pursuant to Rule 54(d). The court also held that a district court should require substantial documentation of a true inability to pay and that comparing the financial resources of the parties would unduly prejudice parties with assets and undermine the presumption that Rule 54(d)(1) creates in prevailing parties' favor.

In the case at hand, the court is faced with a similar situation. The prevailing party, Rochester City School District ("RCSD") and Rochester Teachers Association ("RTA"), requested costs of $18,192.86 and $12,189.11, respectively. The non-prevailing party, plaintiff, objected to the taxation of costs and filed several submissions with the Clerk.

The court notes that the Clerk issued a decision, dated October 27, 2003, explaining his decision to award costs, albeit in a reduced amount. The reduced award of costs was $17,973.96 in favor of RCSD and $11,995.25 in favor of RTA. Plaintiff appeals from that determination.

The court finds that the prevailing party is entitled to costs as a matter of course, unless there is some reason to deny costs. The court notes that the prevailing party's financial status is not a factor that should be considered in this case, as plaintiff's financial circumstances do not warrant denying taxation of costs.

In conclusion, the court affirms the decision of the Clerk, awarding costs to the prevailing party, RCSD and RTA. The court finds that the prevailing party is entitled to costs as a matter of course and that plaintiff's financial circumstances do not warrant denying taxation of costs.
