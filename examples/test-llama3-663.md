The case at hand involves a Title VII suit filed by the Holmans, alleging sexual harassment and retaliation against their supervisor, Gale Uhrich. The district court dismissed their claims, concluding that the Holmans could not claim discrimination because they alleged that Uhrich had been sexually harassing both of them. In reviewing the district court's decision, we must accept the complaint at its face value and will not speculate over how it could have some other meaning.

As stated in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 118 S.Ct. 998 (1998), Title VII's prohibition of discrimination "because of... sex" protects men as well as women, and it applies to sexual harassment claims involving same-sex harassers. However, the court also emphasized that the touchstone of Title VII is discrimination, and that a violation only occurs because of sex discrimination.

The Holmans' allegations, which claim that Uhrich sexually harassed both of them, do not demonstrate discrimination "because of sex." Rather, they demonstrate a pattern of harassment that is not discriminatory. As the court in Pasqua v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 101 F.3d 514, 517 (7th Cir.1996), noted, "Harassment that is inflicted without regard to gender, that is, where males and females in the same setting do not receive disparate treatment, is not actionable because the harassment is not based on sex."

In conclusion, the district court's decision to dismiss the Holmans' claims was correct. The allegations do not demonstrate discrimination "because of sex," and therefore, do not violate Title VII. The case is consistent with the holding in Oncale, which emphasized that the touchstone of Title VII is discrimination, and that a violation only occurs because of sex discrimination.

Their problem is that the allegations in their complaint are very precise; the complaint simply and clearly says that their supervisor was sexually harassing each of them by asking for sexual favors. As a matter of law, then, neither of them has a claim for discrimination under Title VII. Northern Trust Co. v. Peters, 69 F.3d 123, 129 (7th Cir.1995) (“More is not necessarily better under the Federal Rules; a party ‘can plead himself out of court by ... alleging facts which ... demonstrate that he has no legal claim.’ ”) (quoting Trevino v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., 916 F.2d 1230, 1234 (7th Cir.1990)).
