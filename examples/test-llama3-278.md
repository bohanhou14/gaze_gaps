ORDER
HOGAN, District Judge.

After reviewing the legal principles de novo, I find that the Commissioner's decision is not supported by substantial evidence. As held in 812 F.2d 1226, the Secretary's regulation that he will consider observations by non-medical sources as to how an impairment affects a claimant's ability to work must be applied. The testimony of McAllister's treating physician and the observations of his friends and family members are fully competent to substantiate his doctor's diagnosis of depression.

Furthermore, the Commissioner's decision disregards the treating physician's opinion of the combined cumulative effect of McAllister's impairments, which is a critical error. As stated in 880 F.2d 1086, a treating physician's opinion is entitled to considerable weight and should not be disregarded without specific and legitimate reasons.

In this case, the Commissioner's decision is also not supported by substantial evidence. The ALJ's characterization of claimant's residual capacity as capable of light and sedentary work is unsupported by substantial evidence, as held in 753 F.2d 1450.

Accordingly, I REVERSE the decision of the Commissioner and REMAND the case for an award of benefits.

gold_text: “The decision whether to remand a case for additional evidence, or simply to award benefits is within the discretion of the court.” Sprague v. Bowen, 812 F.2d 1226, 1232 (9th Cir.1987). The ALJ’s findings regarding the impossibility of separating the mental limitations imposed by addictions and the mental limitations imposed by mental disorders are certainly supported by the record which does not require further development in the circumstances of this ease. See Tr. 199; Tr. 200; Tr. 80-87; Tr. 78; Tr. 80. Moreover, defendant had the opportunity to remand the matter to remedy any defect and/or further develop the record when plaintiff appealed to the Appeals Council. However, the Council summarily denied review. Remand for further proceedings in this matter is inappropriate as new proceedings would serve to delay the receipt of benefits and are unlikely to add to the existing findings. See McAllister v. Sullivan, 880 F.2d 1086 (9th Cir.1989). Remand for further proceedings is inappropriate as there is substantial evidence in the record, when viewed as a whole, to establish that plaintiff is disabled. See Gallant v. Heckler, 753 F.2d 1450, 1457 (9th Cir.1984).
