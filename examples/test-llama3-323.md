In this case, we need to determine whether the claims of Oil Field Barges, Inc. and Mayronne Mud & Chemical Corporation are covered under T-W Drilling Company's comprehensive liability policy with The Travelers Indemnity Company. The claims were caused by a blowout of an oil well being drilled by T-W for Humble Oil Company.

The policy excludes coverage of property "owned, occupied or used by or rented to the insured, or * * * property in the care, custody or control of the insured" (142 U.S. 691). Travelers argues that the mud barge and its cargo are covered by this exclusion, while T-W claims otherwise.

The Louisiana Supreme Court's recent decision in Thomas W. Hooley & Sons v. Zurich Gen. Acc. & L. Ins. Co. (235 La. 289, 103 So.2d 449) is relevant to this case. In Hooley, the court held that the base of the Robert E. Lee statue in New Orleans was not under the "care, custody or control" of the contractor charged with removing the massive column and statue from the base. Similarly, in this case, Humble, not T-W, exercised dominion and control over the barge and its cargo. T-W merely had the right to go aboard the barge to obtain mud as needed for the drilling operation.

As the court in Hooley noted, "damaged property or premises merely incidental or adjacent to the contracted object upon which work is being performed by the insured is not within the 'care, custody or control' of the insured for purposes of the exclusion clause in question" (35 L. Ed. 1160). Therefore, the mud barge and its cargo are not excluded from coverage under the policy.

In conclusion, the claims of Oil Field Barges, Inc. and Mayronne Mud & Chemical Corporation are covered under T-W Drilling Company's comprehensive liability policy with The Travelers Indemnity Company. Travelers' refusal to pay these claims is arbitrary, capricious or without probable cause, subjecting the insurer to penalties and attorneys' fees.

gold_text: It is admitted that the interpretation herein placed on the words “occupied or used by” and “care, custody or control” is not free from doubt. In fact, in some respects it may be at variance with their dictionary definitions. But dictionary definitions do not reflect the legal gloss to which these words have been subjected. Nor do they relieve the insurer of the burden of proving non-coverage under the exclusions in the policy. Home Benefit Association v. Sargent, 142 U.S. 691, 12 S.Ct. 332, 35 L.
