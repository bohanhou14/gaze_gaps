**Generation:**

In light of the principles articulated in Town of Burlington and David D., it is evident that federal standards under the EAHCA do not wholly preempt state regulations, provided state standards meet or exceed federal minimums. Nevertheless, in cases where state procedures offer less protection than federal standards, federal law prevails.

Specifically, citing *Monahan v. Nebraska*, 645 F.2d 592, it is noted that the EAHCA guarantees due process before an independent officer, a right underscored by the necessity of federal compliance to avoid any irreparable harm, a principle upheld by this Court. Furthermore, as highlighted in 687 F.2d 1164, even preliminary relief linked to compliance issues deemed moot does not undermine the significance of procedural rights afforded to plaintiffs. Additionally, in 748 F.2d 1258, fee awards related to procedural victories in preliminary injunctions emphasize the statutory reliance on federally mandated due process.

Given this framework and the statutory alignment outlined in 20 U.S.C. ยง 1415(e)(2) and Va.Code ยง 22.1-214 D, it is manifest that appeals should adhere to the higher standard of the federal act where state provisions are deficient. Consequently, for ensuring the adherence to mandated due process and procedural compliance, these cases must be remanded to the state courts, respecting the plaintiffs' chosen jurisdiction and precluding federal preemption where adequate state law rights are present.

Therefore, plaintiff's motions to remand are granted.
