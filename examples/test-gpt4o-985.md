**Generation:**

The right to confrontation and cross-examination is not universally applicable to all hearings (967 F.2d 362; Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 567). Whether due process requires these rights depends on the significance and nature of the factual disputes at issue (869 F.2d 553; Miller v. City of Mission, Kan., 705 F.2d 368, 373). Kreso did not seek to require the attendance of certain witnesses at the grievance hearing, similar to the situation in Bradley v. Colonial Mental Health (967 F.2d 362; 856 F.2d 703). Thus, his inability to confront and cross-examine does not constitute a due process violation.

Moreover, the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel are pertinent in evaluating the preclusion effect on Kreso’s claims (917 F.2d 1507; Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94; Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Found., 402 U.S. 313, 323-24). These doctrines bar relitigation of issues that were or could have been raised in the first action. Kreso’s claims regarding procedural irregularities and the exclusion of witnesses do not demonstrate that the DAB failed to provide a fundamentally fair hearing as required by due process (526 U.S. 40; Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 430-431).

Accordingly, we find that the procedures employed by the DAB were consistent with the requirements of due process and applicable legal standards, and thus we affirm the district court’s decision.

gold_text: Kreso asserts he was not allowed to cross-examine witnesses Patricia Lyman, Sylvia Murray, Karla Perkins, Kim Ator, Michael Blieden, Francis Keffler, Mark Phillips, Carlos Montoya, and Ann Jodway to expose “their inconsistencies, and bias.” Kreso does not explain who these witnesses are, at what stage in the proceedings they testified, or what he believes to be their alleged inconsistencies and biases. In discussing this claim, the district court concluded several of. these witnesses did not testify at the DAB hearing either because Kreso successfully had them removed from the witness list or because Kreso made no effort to obtain their testimony at the hearing. In his opening brief, Kreso does not identify the efforts he undertook to call the remaining individuals as witnesses at the DAB hearing, or how any such efforts were thwarted by the VA. See West v. Grand Cty., 967 F.2d 362, 369 (10th Cir.1992) (holding a due process claim failed because the plaintiff did not seek to require a witnesses’s attendance at a post-termination grievance hearing and was not “inhibited or restricted from doing so”). In his reply brief, however, Kreso asserts he supplied the VA with a witness list and the VA was responsible for securing the attendance of any witness on that list who was employed by the VA. Kreso references a letter his counsel sent to the chairperson of the DAB in which he requested that the VA make seven individuals available at the hearing. Of the seven names included in Kreso’s letter, only Ann Jodway is also mentioned in Kreso’s appellate briefing. Although Kreso argues he was denied the right to cross-examine Ms. Jodway to expose her biases, he does not identify any statements she made to the AIB or the DAB and it appears he, instead, considered her a character witness. See SIL-FLO, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1513-14 (10th Cir.1990) (setting out the well-established rule that this court does not sift through the record to find evidence supporting a party’s position). This court does not engage in speculation. Kreso’s due process argument as to Ms. Jodway fails because he has wholly failed to present any meaningful argument that this court can address. See Meder v. Okla. City, 869 F.2d 553, 555 (10th Cir.1989) (holding due process claim failed because plaintiff failed to explain “how confrontation and cross-examination would have changed the” outcome of his hearing), abrogated on other grounds by Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 59, 119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999).
