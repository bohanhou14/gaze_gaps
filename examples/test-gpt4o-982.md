The defendants argue that the bankruptcy judge erroneously failed to recuse herself due to alleged bias, claiming that prior proceedings revealed a pre-determined outcome. However, federal statutes and case law clearly outline the parameters for judicial recusal. According to 28 U.S.C. §§ 144 and 455, as interpreted in cases like Berger v. United States, 255 U.S. 22, 31, any alleged bias must stem from an extrajudicial source. Moreover, adverse findings based on a judge’s participation in a case are insufficient grounds for disqualification, as established in United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 583, and further elucidated in 618 F.2d 923. Similarly, extrajudicial bias was not indicated in the record, in line with sentiments from 533 F.2d 775. The judge explicitly stated impartiality during proceedings, reaffirming her role as a neutral arbiter, in accordance with standards set forth in 558 F.2d 59 and 487 F.2d 245. Therefore, the motion for recusal was rightfully denied.

gold_text: The bankruptcy judge’s decision was not in error. The law as to a recusal based upon bias as set forth by defendants is that “[t]he alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.” United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 1710, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966); see also, Berger v. United States, 255 U.S. 22, 41 S.Ct. 230, 65 L.Ed. 481 (1921); In re International Business Machines Corp., 618 F.2d 923 (2d Cir. 1980); United States v. Wolfson, 558 F.2d 59 (2d Cir. 1977); Mitchell v. Sirica, 502 F.2d 375 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 418 U.S. 955, 94 S.Ct. 3232, 41 L.Ed.2d 1177 (1974); Coyne v. Houss, No. 81 Civ. 2198 (E.D.N.Y.1981); Hill v. Town of Islip, No. 80 Civ. 1835 (E.D.N.Y.1981); Lazofsky v. Sommerset Bus Co., 389 F.Supp. 1041 (E.D.N.Y.1975). It is clear from a reading of this record that “[n]one of [the bankruptcy judge’s comments] appear to have arisen from an extrajudicial source or ‘resulted in the formulation of an opinion on the merits not based upon what the judge has learned by [her] participation in the proceedings.’ ” United States v. Bernstein, 533 F.2d 775, 785 (2d Cir. 1976) quoting United States v. Sclafani, 487 F.2d 245, 255 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1023, 94 S.Ct. 445, 38 L.Ed.2d 313 (1973).
