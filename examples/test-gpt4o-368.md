III.

The role of privileged communications and their discoverability plays a crucial part in this case. The Federal Circuit's stance on attorney-client privilege in fiduciary relationships is well-established and reflected in multiple decisions, aligning with other circuits and international rulings. Specifically, the cases of Langley v. Union Elec. Co., 107 F.3d 510, 514 (7th Cir. 1997), and In re Golant, 239 F.3d 931, 937 (7th Cir. 2001) affirm that sanctions stem from willfulness, bad faith, or fault, which was a consideration in applying fiduciary exceptions here (406 F.3d 867). 

Moreover, the applicability of privilege in selective disclosures was highlighted in In re Sealed Case, emphasizing the fairness doctrine’s limits to partial disclosures and not selective ones (951 F.2d 1414). This parallels the considerations in United States v. Nobles where testimonial use of privileged materials can imply waiver (676 F.2d 793). Additionally, the mandated disclosure under immediate appellate review, as indicated in In re Berkley and Co., further supports the procedural balance required to ensure privilege protection while allowing necessary discovery (723 F.2d 1461).

Thus, with the balance of protecting the attorney-client relationship while upholding fiduciary duties to the tribe, the court’s existing confidentiality agreements mitigate the risk of wider disclosure ramifications (182 F.R.D. 182, 135 F.R.D. 94). Given the legal precedents, the order for production aligns with established frameworks, and further delay poses undue risks to case integrity and timely resolution.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
