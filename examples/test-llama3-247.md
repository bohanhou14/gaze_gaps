The case at hand involves a dispute between the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) and Timberline Property Development, Inc. (Debtor) regarding the enforceability of certain clauses in the mortgage agreement. The RTC seeks payment of interest at the default rate, late charges, and origination fees. However, the Debtor argues that these clauses are unenforceable penalties.

In determining the enforceability of these clauses, the Court must look to state and federal law. Under New Jersey law, a liquidated damages clause is enforceable only if it is a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm caused by the breach, and the harm is one that is incapable of estimation or very difficult to estimate accurately. Barr & Sons, Inc. v. Cherry Hill Center, Inc., 90 N.J.Super. 358, 376-77, 217 A.2d 631 (App.Div.1966).

The Court must also consider the essence and intent of the clause in question. In this case, Ms. Kavanaugh testified that the default rate of interest was designed to induce payment by the mortgagor. This testimony negates any inference that the default rate bears a direct relation to actual administrative expenses incurred by the lender. Therefore, the Court finds that the RTC's claim for interest at the default rate is an unenforceable penalty.

The Court also finds that the provision for late charges is an unenforceable penalty. Under 11 U.S.C. § 506(b), a secured creditor may recover a delinquency charge where the charge is reasonable as a matter of state law. However, the late charge in this case does not reflect actual compensation to the creditor for the extra administrative expenses in handling the late payment. In re L.H.D. Realty Corp., 20 B.R. 722, 725 (Bankr.S.D.Ind.1982).

In conclusion, the Court finds that the RTC is not entitled to payment of interest at the default rate or late charges. The Court also finds that the RTC's claim for origination fees is unenforceable as a penalty.

gold_text: In addition to bearing a relationship to the amount of actual loss incurred by the creditor, the primary purpose of the clause cannot be to compel prompt payment. In re Oahu Cabinets, Ltd., 12 B.R. 160, 165 (Bkrtcy.D.Haw.1981). Again, Ms. Kava-naugh testified that the 5% late charge was also “intended to coerce performance” by the debtor. (Transcript pgs. 20-21). Accordingly, this Court holds that the contractual provision providing for a late charge of 5% for any monthly interest installment not received within fifteen days is an unenforceable penalty. See In re Tastyeast, Inc., 126 F.2d 879 (3d Cir.1942).
