This case presents a question of first impression for the Court of Federal Claims, regarding the jurisdiction of the court to hear a bid protest action against the United States Postal Service (USPS). The court holds that it has jurisdiction to hear the protest, despite the USPS's exemption from the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Tucker Act.

The court relies on the plain meaning of the Tucker Act, which grants the court jurisdiction to hear actions against the United States founded on the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department. The court also notes that the APA standard of review, set forth in 5 U.S.C. § 706, is not applicable to this case because the court's jurisdiction is dependent on the Tucker Act, not federal procurement law or the APA.

The court rejects the USPS's argument that it is exempt from the Tucker Act because of its exemption from the APA. The court concludes that the plain meaning of the Tucker Act confers jurisdiction on the court to hear protests challenging USPS procurement decisions and to grant equitable relief.

The court also rejects the argument that the district courts are without authority to review USPS procurement decisions under Scanwell, citing cases such as National Easter Seal Soc'y v. United States Postal Serv., 656 F.2d 754 (D.C.Cir. 1981) and Concept Automation Inc. v. United States Postal Serv., 887 F.Supp. 6 (D.D.C. 1995).

In conclusion, the court has jurisdiction to hear the bid protest action against the USPS, and the court will review the procurement to determine if the USPS violated its Procurement Manual or the Solicitation. The court's jurisdiction is conferred by the Tucker Act, and the court will apply the standard of review set forth in 5 U.S.C. § 706.
