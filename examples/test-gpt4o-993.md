The search and seizure that took place on the sidewalk in front of 400 Central Park West should be examined under the principles established in the referenced cases. When Vega and Washington exited the apartment, Washington intentionally discarded the brown paper bag containing heroin and cocaine, which was subsequently seized by Detective King. This situation is analogous to United States v. Zimple, 318 F.2d 679, where evidence discarded by a defendant in custody was held admissible. The query here hinges on whether the arrest was lawful.

In the instant case, the observations and actions leading to the seizure of the narcotics seem to fall within the legal framework. The act of discarding the bag can be viewed as voluntary abandonment, thus making the contraband recoverable without a preceding arrest being deemed illegal. This perspective aligns with Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, and Hester v. United States, 265 U.S. 57, which assert that truly abandoned property is subject to seizure without probable cause.

Further analysis would also consider Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, which elucidates the principles of tainted evidence and its impact on admissibility. As the narcotics in this case were not interconnected with any prior unlawful search or seizure, but rather discarded in plain sight, the evidence gathered from the sidewalk would not be deemed inadmissible.

Therefore, the seizure of the bag falls within established legal principles, supporting its admissibility in prosecuting narcotic law violations.

The evidence seized, however, is inadmissible against Vega since the seizure is not relevant to the issues. It is only when the relationship between Vega and Washington is shown that the evidence is pertinent. The illegally seized telephone conversations and the consequent observations at the Moonlight Bar and Grill and at 400 Central Park West are inadmissible. Silverthorne Lumber Co. v.
