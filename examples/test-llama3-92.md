The plaintiff sues for the recovery of income taxes which, he says, he should not have been required to pay. He claims that certain federal excise stamp taxes which he had to pay upon the transfer of corporation stocks were deductible by him from his 1947 income, but that he was not allowed the deduction, and therefore he was required to pay a larger income tax than he owed.

In Helvering v. Winmill, 305 U.S. 79, the Court held that a taxpayer who bought and sold securities could not deduct the commissions paid on his purchases as a business expense. Similarly, in this case, the stock transfer stamp taxes paid by the plaintiff as a trader in securities should not be deducted as ordinary and necessary business expenses. Instead, they should be treated as offsets against the selling price, relevant only to the determination of capital losses or gains.

Furthermore, in Commissioner v. Weiss, 315 U.S. 626, the Court recognized that the specific regulation pertaining to securities transactions provides that commissions paid in purchasing securities are a part of the cost price of such securities, while commissions paid in selling securities, when such commissions are not an ordinary and necessary business expense, are an offset against the selling price. Following the same logic, the stock transfer stamp taxes paid by the plaintiff should be treated as part of the cost price of the securities, rather than as ordinary and necessary business expenses.

In conclusion, the plaintiff's claim that the stock transfer stamp taxes were deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses is not supported by the relevant case law and regulations. The taxes should be treated as offsets against the selling price, relevant only to the determination of capital losses or gains, rather than as deductible business expenses.

gold_text: The Government cites the Supreme Court cases of Helvering v. Winmill, 305 U.S. 79, 59 S.Ct. 45, 83 L.Ed. 52, and Spreckles v. C. I. R., 315 U.S. 626, 62 S.Ct. 777, 86 L.Ed. 1073, in which it was held that commissions paid on the transfer of stocks were not deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses, but had to be capitalized. But the plaintiff points out that the Supreme Court, in its opinion, expressly relies upon a Treasury Regulation of long standing which had survived several amendments and reenactments of the income tax law. Here we have no such situation.
