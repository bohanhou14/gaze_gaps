The case at hand is Lisdahl v. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, where the plaintiff, Chad Leroy Lisdahl, a veteran, sued his employer, Gold Cross Ambulance, and his supervisor, David B. Johnson, alleging workplace discrimination and constructive discharge on the basis of veteran status, in violation of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act of 1994 (USERRA).

The district court found that Lisdahl failed to present a prima facie case under USERRA, because he did not show any adverse employment action by Gold Cross or Johnson. Furthermore, the court found no evidence that any particular employment action by Johnson or Gold Cross was motivated by anti-veteran animus, or that such animus was a motivating factor in prompting the action that was taken.

Regarding the constructive discharge claim, the court concluded that Lisdahl's working conditions at Gold Cross were not objectively intolerable, and that he did not demonstrate that his status as a veteran was a motivating factor in his constructive discharge. The court also found that Lisdahl had not given Gold Cross a reasonable opportunity to correct the alleged intolerable conditions before he quit.

In a separate appeal, Amendola and Swor, two paramedics who assisted Lisdahl's lawsuit, claimed that they were retaliated against by Johnson for their support of Lisdahl's claims. The district court granted summary judgment to Gold Cross and Johnson, finding that the actions alleged by Amendola and Swor were not materially adverse. The court noted that USERRA does not provide a remedy for trivial harms, and that the anti-retaliation provision of USERRA has a more limited scope than Title VII's anti-retaliation provision.

The court in Suders v. Pennsylvania State Police, 542 U.S. 129, 124 S.Ct. 2342, 159 L.Ed.2d 204 (2004), held that in a Title VII action alleging hostile-work-environment sexual harassment by a supervisor, a constructive discharge claim is subject to an employer's affirmative defense that 1) no tangible employment action was taken; 2) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct harassment; and 3) the employee failed to take advantage of the employer's procedures for addressing workplace harassment. Similarly, in White v. Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405,

gold_text: Applying the material adversity standard to the claims of Amendola and Swor, the actions of which Amendola and Swor complain do not rise to the level of actionable retaliation. These are the garden-variety complaints about minor slights and disagreements with supervisors that are not protected by USERRA. A federal court does not sit as a super-personnel department that oversees a company’s general employment practices and guarantees to each employee a genial boss. See, e.g., Gilbert v. Des Moines Area Cmty. Coll., 495 F.3d 906, 916 (8th Cir.2007); Harvey v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 38 F.3d 968, 973 (8th Cir.1994). Because the “retaliations” claimed by Amendola and Swor were not materially adverse employment actions, the district court did not err in granting Gold Cross and Johnson’s motion for summary judgment.
