The case at hand is a tragic one, where a patient, Juanita F. Gerber, attempted suicide after being discharged from Northwest Hospital Center's emergency room. Gerber's complaint alleges that the hospital and its physician, Dr. Neustadt, failed to address her psychiatric symptoms, resulting in her suicide attempt. The issue before the court is whether Gerber's complaint states a claim under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA).

In reviewing the complaint, the court must construe all inferences in favor of Gerber. However, the court finds that Gerber's allegations do not state a claim under EMTALA. The statute requires hospitals to provide an "appropriate medical screening examination" to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists, and to stabilize any such condition before discharging or transferring the patient. 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a)-(c).

The court finds that Dr. Neustadt's failure to address Gerber's psychiatric symptoms does not constitute a violation of EMTALA's screening provision. The court notes that the screening provision is aimed at disparate treatment, and that Gerber does not allege that she received disparate treatment compared to others with the same condition. Additionally, the court finds that Dr. Neustadt's failure to recognize Gerber's underlying psychiatric problems may support a claim for negligent failure to diagnose, but that EMTALA is not intended to be used as a federal malpractice statute.

The court also finds that Gerber's "failure to stabilize" claim is without merit. The statute requires hospitals to stabilize conditions they actually detect, not conditions they should have detected. Vickers v. Nash Gen. Hosp., Inc., 78 F.3d 139, 145 (4th Cir.1996).

In conclusion, the court finds that Gerber's complaint fails to state a claim under EMTALA. The court grants defendants' motions to dismiss with prejudice.
