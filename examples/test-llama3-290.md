The case at hand involves a dispute between the United States and four defendants who entered into cooperating plea agreements. The agreements stipulated that each defendant would provide substantial assistance to the government in exchange for a negotiated plea. However, the government failed to file Rule 35 motions on behalf of three of the defendants, citing their involvement in a plot to flee the country.

In analyzing this case, we must consider the principles set forth in United States v. Boatner, 966 F.2d 1575 (11th Cir.1992), which hold that a plea agreement must be enforced as reasonably understood by the parties at the time it was entered into. In this case, the defendants claim that their cooperation agreements were "group cooperation agreements," whereby cooperation by one defendant would inure to the benefit of all. However, the written agreements contain no language supporting this construction.

Furthermore, the government's conduct in filing a Rule 35 motion on behalf of one defendant, Francisco Quintana, but not the others, raises questions about bad faith. In United States v. Rewis, 404 U.S. 257 (1971), the Supreme Court held that a prosecutor has a duty to fulfill promises made during plea negotiations. While the government's failure to file Rule 35 motions may not rise to the level of bad faith, it is clear that the government's representatives exhibited a cavalier attitude in their dealings with defense counsel.

In conclusion, while the defendants have raised legitimate concerns about the government's conduct, they have failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the government acted in bad faith or that the plea agreements were intended to benefit all defendants equally. The court's role is to enforce the agreements as reasonably understood by the parties at the time they were entered into, and in this case, the government's conduct, while questionable, does not rise to the level of bad faith. The defendants' motion to enforce the plea agreements or withdraw their guilty pleas is denied.

gold_text: The legal standards applied by the Court in Ganz are equally applicable to this case. “When a guilty plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.” United States v. Rewis, 969 F.2d 985, 988 (11th Cir.1992) (quoting Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971)). In Ganz, this Court would not condone the government’s bad faith refusal to honor its promise. In similar circumstances, the Court would not hesitate in doing so again. The facts presented by this ease, however, do not support a finding of bad faith on the part of the government. This case is in the opinion of the Court, borderline and demonstrates the necessity that counsel must be ever alert to cross all the “t”s and dot all the “i”s in the negotiation and preparation of plea agreements.
