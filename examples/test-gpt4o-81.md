Plaintiff seeks an award of attorneys' fees and costs associated with the litigation. Title VII, under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k), allows for such an award in the court's discretion (503 F.2d 177). The primary purpose of this provision is to enable plaintiffs to obtain competent legal representation in their fight against discrimination (641 F.2d 880). In this instance, the jury has already rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on multiple claims of discrimination and retaliation, entitling him to reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs of the suit.

Furthermore, according to precedent, a plaintiff may voluntarily waive attorneys' fees during settlement negotiations, provided there is no coercion or demand by the defendant to do so (762 F.2d 1093). In this case, plaintiff's counsel did not waive any claims to attorneys' fees and therefore, is entitled to a fee award.

Given the favorable jury verdict and in line with the statutory provisions and policies underlying Title VII, the Court will approve plaintiff's motion for reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing this action. The specific amount will be determined after a thorough review of detailed billing records submitted by plaintiff's counsel.
