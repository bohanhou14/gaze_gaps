CONCLUSIONS OF LAW (continued)

In Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55, the Supreme Court emphasized that property rights in the assets of a bankrupt's estate are determined by state law unless a federal interest dictates otherwise. In this case, we must determine the debtor's obligations under Puerto Rican law and assess the applicability of interest on the debt owed to Nelson Torres Ruiz.

Consistent with the principles outlined in 114 B.R. 326, the determination of whether the debtor has a legal or equitable interest in the obligation to return the $3,000 option money necessitates an analysis grounded in applicable nonbankruptcy state law. Article 1061 of the P.R. Civil Code, 31 Laws of P.R.Ann., Section 3025, establishes that where a debtor fails to perform an obligation, the creditor is entitled to interest as indemnification for damages and losses incurred.

Debtor's claim of impossibility of performance is addressed under Article 1138 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, but as established earlier, such a defense is unwarranted when the impossibility is not due to legal or physical barriers (31 Laws of P.R.Ann., Section 3193). Given the absence of such barriers, the return of the $3,000 is mandated.

Furthermore, in alignment with 117 B.R. 15, the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings does not alter the creditorâ€™s right to claim interest at the legal rate. Should the contract fail to specify an interest rate, Article 1061 defaults to a legal interest rate of 6% per annum.

Thus, Mr. Bonilla is obliged to reimburse the full amount of $3,000 plus the applicable legal interest rate of 6% from the expiration of the option contract until the filing of the bankruptcy petition.
