The cases mentioned, 80 F.3d 64, 512 U.S. 821, and 971 F.2d 926, all involve issues related to contempt and sanctions. In the case of 80 F.3d 64, the court held that a noncompensatory fine is civil and may be imposed without a criminal trial, but only if the contemnor is afforded an opportunity to purge.

In the case of 512 U.S. 821, the court discussed the distinction between civil and criminal contempts. The court emphasized that whether a contempt is civil or criminal turns on the "character and purpose" of the sanction involved. The court also noted that a fine is considered civil if it is remedial, and for the benefit of the plaintiff, but if it is punitive, it is considered criminal.

In the case of 971 F.2d 926, the court addressed the issue of sanctions under Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court held that an award of attorney's fees and costs to the plaintiff was improper because it was based on a finding of bad faith, which is not supported by the evidence. The court also vacated a fine imposed on the defendant's attorney because it was imposed without affording him due process.

In the case at hand, the district court imposed a fine on the defendant's attorney for failure to comply with discovery orders. The court did not provide the attorney with notice of the possibility of a fine and did not afford him the opportunity to present evidence or arguments against the imposition of the fine. This was a violation of the attorney's due process rights.

Therefore, the fine imposed on the defendant's attorney should be vacated and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings. The district court should provide the attorney with notice of the possibility of a fine and afford him the opportunity to present evidence or arguments against the imposition of the fine. Only then can the court consider imposing a fine that is fair and constitutes a reasonable sanction for the attorney's conduct.

gold_text: . Although Mo’s sanction appears to have been a criminal, as opposed to a civil, fine, see, e.g., People of the State of New York v. Operation Rescue Nat’l, 80 F.3d 64, 68 n. 7 (2d Cir.) ("[A] non-compensatory fine is civil, and thus may ordinarily be imposed in the absence of a criminal trial 'only if the contemnor is afforded an opportunity to purge.' ") (quoting International Union, United Mine Workers v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, -, 114 S.Ct. 2552, 2558, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994)), cert. denied, - U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 85, 136 L.Ed.2d 42 (1996), we need not decide which it was here. For even a civil fine cannot stand when it is imposed without basic due process safeguards. "[A] person charged with civil contempt is entitled to notice of the allegations, the right to counsel, and a hearing at which the ... defendant has an opportunity to present a defense.” Schoenberg v. Shapolsky Publishers, Inc., 971 F.2d 926, 934-35 (2d Cir.1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We note, however, that if the district court wishes on remand to impose a criminal fine, it must first provide all of the procedural protections associated with criminal proceedings.
