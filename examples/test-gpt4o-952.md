In addressing the due process claims, it is critical to recognize the established principles set forth in prior Supreme Court decisions. An essential principle of due process, as reiterated in *Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.*, 339 U.S. 306 (1950), is that a deprivation of property "be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case."

In this instance, the determination of restitution by the prison officials, without offering Artway an opportunity for a hearing, fails to align with this foundational requirement. Likewise, in *Boddie v. Connecticut*, 401 U.S. 371 (1971), the Court emphasized the necessity of a hearing before an individual is deprived of any significant property interest, highlighting that "an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant property interest."

Furthermore, *Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill*, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), underscores that once the Due Process Clause applies, "the question remains what process is due." The Court in Loudermill further affirmed that the deprivation of property requires procedural safeguards including a fair hearing, which was similarly echoed in *Mathews v. Eldridge*, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), where the Court discussed the parameters of due process in relation to the deprivation of property interests.

Therefore, the failure to provide Artway with a hearing to contest the amount of restitution constitutes a clear violation of the due process principles outlined in these landmark cases. Given this lack of procedural safeguard, the Court finds the procedures adopted by the defendant to be constitutionally deficient and hereby grants summary judgment in favor of Artway on his due process claim.

gold_text: The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that “a deprivation of life, liberty or property ‘be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.’ ” Cleve land Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1493, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1984) (quoting Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 313, 70 S.Ct. 652, 656, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)). The Supreme Court describes “ ‘the root requirement’ of the Due Process Clause as being ‘that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant property.’ ” Id. at 542, 105 S.Ct. at 1493 (quoting Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 379, 91 S.Ct. 780, 786, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971) (emphasis in original). The process due in a particular situation is determined according to a balancing of competing interests test. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976); Loudermill, supra, at 542-43, 105 S.Ct. at 1493-94. The considerations to be balanced include the private interest at stake; the risk of an erroneous deprivation through the procedures used; the value, if any, of additional procedural safeguards; and the Government’s interest, including the cost and burden of additional safeguards. Mathews, supra, at 325, 96 S.Ct. at 898. Finally, the Third Circuit has noted that a hearing can be postponed until after a deprivation only if a “case falls within extremely narrow lines reserved for ... limited situations.... ” Stana v. School Dist. of City of Pittsburgh, 775 F.2d 122, 127 (3rd Cir.1985).
