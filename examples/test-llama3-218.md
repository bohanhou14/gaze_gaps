The reference articles provided are a collection of legal cases that deal with issues of arrest, search and seizure, and the Fourth Amendment. The cases of Watson v. United States (423 U.S. 411) and Tennessee v. Garner (414 U.S. 218) are particularly relevant in this context.

In Watson v. United States, the Supreme Court held that a warrantless arrest made by a postal inspector was valid because it was authorized by statute and regulation. The court noted that the inspector had probable cause to believe that Watson had committed a felony and that the arrest was made in accordance with the governing statute and regulations. This case highlights the importance of statutory and regulatory authority in warrantless arrests.

In Tennessee v. Garner, the Supreme Court held that a warrantless arrest made by a police officer was not unconstitutional because it was based on probable cause and was made in a situation where the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the suspect was fleeing from a crime. The court noted that the officer's actions were reasonable under the circumstances and that the arrest was made in a situation where there was no time to obtain a warrant.

The case of Sifuentes v. United States (504 F.2d 845) is also relevant to this analysis. In this case, the court held that a warrantless search of a truck was not unconstitutional because it was based on probable cause and was made in a situation where the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the truck contained contraband.

In conclusion, the reference articles provided demonstrate that warrantless arrests and searches can be valid under certain circumstances, such as when they are authorized by statute and regulation, or when they are based on probable cause and reasonable suspicion. However, each case must be evaluated on its own facts and circumstances to determine whether the warrantless arrest or search was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

gold_text: There can be no question that the detectives had probable cause to arrest the defendant when the response to their request for a license check reported that the Monte Carlo was listed as stolen. There was no need for a warrant since the detectives arrested the defendant for a felony in a public place. United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 418, 423-24, 96 S.Ct. 820, 825, 827-28, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976). Therefore, the search of the defendantâ€™s person incident to the arrest was reasonable. United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 472, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). Likewise, the seizure of evidence from the Monte Carlo was proper because the items seized were in plain view. United States v. Sifuentes, 504 F.2d 845, 848-49 (4th Cir. 1974).
