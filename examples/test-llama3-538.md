The instant case, Wortendyke, District Judge, presents a petition for naturalization filed on July 6, 1956. The petitioner, a 49-year-old Portuguese national, has made claims that he applied for exemption from military service in 1942 under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. He asserts that he was unaware that his application would bar him from becoming a citizen of the United States.

In this regard, we must consider the precedents set forth in cases such as 247 F.2d 139 and 255 F.2d 81. In the former case, it was established that an individual who applies for exemption from military service as an alien and is subsequently relieved from such service becomes permanently ineligible for citizenship under § 315(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.

Similarly, in the latter case, it was held that an individual who makes application for exemption from military service and is actually relieved from such service has deprived himself of the right to United States citizenship. In light of these precedents, it is clear that the petitioner's application for exemption from military service in 1942, which was granted, renders him permanently ineligible for citizenship.

Furthermore, the petitioner's testimony suggests that he was aware of the potential consequences of his actions, having consulted with the Portuguese Consul and being informed that executing DSS Form 301 would result in his loss of job. Nevertheless, he chose to sign the document voluntarily, thereby relinquishing his right to citizenship.

In conclusion, the petitioner's application for exemption from military service in 1942, which was granted, renders him permanently ineligible for citizenship. As such, the petition for naturalization must be denied. The judgment of the District Court is correct, and we sustain the Government's position.

gold_text: There was further placed in evidence before me the petitioner’s letter of November 14, 1944 to the Immigration and Naturalization Service in which he reaffirmed the intention which he expressed in his application for relief from military service because he was a citizen of Portugal and did not consider himself obliged to join the United States Army. In the same letter he stated that he had reconsidered and requested a return of the Declaration of Intention which he had previously surrendered. Petitioner’s apparent intention to reseek citizenship arose only after he had been classified 4-F and after more than two years of having been accorded an exemption on the basis of alienage. Such late manifestation of intention does not entitle petitioner to the removal of the barrier which he himself has placed in the path leading to citizenship. United States v.
