In assessing Plaintiffs’ Request for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Preliminary Injunction, the court must consider the likelihood of success on the merits and the potential for irreparable harm. The Fourth Circuit precedent requires a "clear showing" of immediate and irreparable injury (Reference case 952 F.2d 802), meaning the harm must be both "actual" and "immediate." Here, Plaintiffs' allegations fail to meet this stringent requirement as their injuries, while serious, do not demonstrate the immediacy required for such relief.

Moreover, Plaintiffs have not shown that the balance of hardships "tips decidedly" in their favor. The standard requires weighing the likelihood of irreparable harm to Plaintiffs against the potential harm to Defendant (Reference case 550 F.2d 189). Since the evidence presented does not clearly establish imminent risk in the current conditions, the balance does not favor Plaintiffs decisively. Accordingly, given the absence of immediate, irreparable harm, and the lack of a significant imbalance of hardships justifying this extraordinary remedy, Plaintiffs’ request for a TRO and Preliminary Injunction is denied.

gold_text: The final matter before the Court, therefore, is Plaintiffs’ Request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (hereinafter “Plaintiffs’ Request”), which Plaintiffs included as part of their Memorandum in Opposition to the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss and Request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. Plaintiffs request that the Court enjoin IBM from continued removal of allegedly mold-covered materials, which Plaintiffs contend they need to examine to pursue their claims against IBM. In its Reply Brief, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs’ Request violates the Local Rules of this district. Notwithstanding Defendant’s contentions that Plaintiffs have committed procedural errors in making their Request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, the Court will, with respect to Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, nevertheless consider Plaintiffs’ Request on the merits. The Court notes that a preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy ... to be applied only in [the] limited circumstances which clearly demand it.” Direx Israel, Ltd. v. Breakthrough Med. Corp., 952 F.2d 802, 811 (4th Cir.1991) (second alteration in original) (internal quotations omitted). In determining whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction, the Court must consider four factors: (1) the plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying dispute; (2) the likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiff if the injunction is denied; (3) the likelihood of harm to the defendant if the injunction is issued; and (4) the public interest. Blackwelder Furniture Co. of Statesville v. Seilig Mfg. Co., 550 F.2d 189, 192-93, 196 (4th Cir.1977). As discussed above, the Court has granted Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim. Therefore, based upon the Court’s ruling on Plaintiffs’ Woodson claims, it is clear that Plaintiffs cannot prevail on the merits of their claims. Further, to grant a preliminary injunction under these circumstances would cause greater harm to Defendant than to Plaintiffs given the Court’s ruling on the substantive issue before the Court. In addition, there would be no public interest served by granting a preliminary injunction under the circumstances of this case. Furthermore, as a practical matter, any injunctive relief now would likely be ineffectual due to the substantial likelihood that IBM had already removed the toxic-mold-covered materials from the facility by the time this matter was submitted to this Court for consideration. For the foregoing reasons, therefore, Plaintiffs’ Request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction is denied.
