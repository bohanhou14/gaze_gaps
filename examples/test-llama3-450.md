This case comes to us for review after three trials and two prior appeals. The primary issue is whether the defendant, Stewart, was legally insane at the time of the crime. The defense relies on the testimony of Dr. Williams, a psychiatrist who examined Stewart and concluded that he was suffering from manic depressive psychosis. However, the prosecution presented evidence from two psychiatrists who examined Stewart and concluded that he was not suffering from a mental disease or defect.

The court must consider the evidence presented by both sides and determine whether Stewart was legally insane at the time of the crime. In Durham v. United States, 214 F.2d 879, the court held that the test of criminal responsibility is whether the accused suffered from an abnormal mental condition that deprived him of the capacity to distinguish right from wrong. In this case, the evidence presented by the prosecution suggests that Stewart was not suffering from an abnormal mental condition.

Furthermore, the court must consider the issue of diminished responsibility. In Durham v. United States, the court held that a defendant who is suffering from a mental disease or defect may be deemed to have diminished responsibility. However, in this case, the evidence presented by the prosecution suggests that Stewart's mental condition was not so severe that it deprived him of the capacity to form the intent required for first-degree murder.

In conclusion, the court finds that the evidence presented by the prosecution is sufficient to support the conviction of first-degree murder. The court rejects the defense's claim that Stewart was legally insane at the time of the crime and finds that he had the capacity to form the intent required for first-degree murder. The judgment is therefore affirmed.
