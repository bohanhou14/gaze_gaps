Turning to the possession with intent to distribute offense, Clarke challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. To support a conviction for possession with intent to distribute, the government must show that the defendant knowingly possessed the controlled substance with the intent to distribute it (See United States v. Montes-Cardenas, 746 F.2d 771, 778 (11th Cir.1984); 138 F.3d 906). Mere presence in a car containing contraband is insufficient in itself to sustain a conviction for possession with intent to distribute (See United States v. Stanley, 24 F.3d 1314, 1320 (11th Cir.1994); 138 F.3d 906).

In this case, the evidence showed that Clarke was not merely present but actively involved in the cocaine trafficking activities at the BBT warehouse. Statements made by Clarke to undercover DEA Agent Joe Figueroa evidenced a "consciousness of guilt," which is sufficient to support an inference of knowledge and intent to distribute cocaine (See United States v. Sanchez, 722 F.2d 1501, 1505 (11th Cir.1984); 922 F.2d 782). Moreover, Clarke's participation in the logistics of receiving shipments further indicates his association with and intent to further the criminal venture (See United States v. Pareja, 876 F.2d 1567, 1570 (11th Cir.1989); 922 F.2d 782).

Therefore, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable trier of fact to find Clarke guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of possession with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine.
