Plaintiffs also argue that the delay in rescission amounted to a violation of their constitutional due process rights. This notion echoes Wakefield’s assertion in a prior decision where it was suggested that a significant delay might violate constitutional rights (131 F.3d 967). However, the plaintiffs fail to substantiate this claim with solid evidence, making their argument speculative at best.

Moreover, even assuming a due process claim, it must be supported by adequate evidence. The mere assertion of delayed rescission cannot, by itself, support a due process violation akin to how a destruction of evidence, alone, is insufficient to survive a summary judgment (529 F.3d 278). Without compelling evidence, the constitutional argument remains untenable.

Lastly, plaintiffs’ belated assertion for certification of their status further undermines their position. The practice of requesting certification post-judgment is often frowned upon unless there are compelling reasons to justify such delay (7 F.3d 270). Plaintiffs’ failure to timely exercise both their rescission rights and any subsequent legal claims aligns more closely with an ordinary civil case where failure to plead timely constitutes a waiver (391 F.3d 1192).

In sum, plaintiffs' claims do not meet the requisite standards, both procedurally and substantively, to warrant deviation from the established statutory requirements or to entertain novel constitutional arguments.

gold_text: . The only case that plaintiffs cite in support of the proposition that lack of notice of their right of rescission extends or eliminates the § 1703(c) deadline is Engle Homes, Inc. v. Krasna, 766 So.2d 311 (Fla.App. 4 Dist.2000). In Krasna, the court did not examine the statutory language in meaningful detail, but instead held in conclusory terms that the purchasers could not have timely waived their right to rescind the contract because the right of rescission was not expressly stated in the contract, and the purchasers did not learn of that right until 31 months after the fact. Krasna’s reasoning is problematic and ultimately unavailing to plaintiffs for three reasons. First, the doctrine of waiver generally does not apply to a plaintiff's failure to bring an action within a statutory limitations period; rather, waiver is generally discussed in terms of a defendant's waiver of a right to invoke the limitations defense. See generally Day v. Crosby, 391 F.3d 1192, 1194 (11th Cir.2004) ("In an ordinary civil case, a failure to plead the bar of the statute of limitations constitutes a waiver of the defense.") (citation omitted). Second, Krasna’s determination that the purchasers could not be held accountable for a statutory limitations period of which they were not aware is contrary to well-established law concerning tolling of such periods. A plaintiff’s lack of knowledge of a limitations deadline is generally not an excuse for his failure to comply with it. See, e.g., Wakefield v. Railroad Retirement Bd., 131 F.3d 967, 970 (11th Cir.1997) (“Ignorance of the law usually is not a factor that can warrant equitable tolling.”); Whitt v. Stephens County, 529 F.3d 278, 2008 WL 2122814, *5 n. 7 (5th Cir. May 21, 2008) (opining that "neither excusable neglect nor ignorance of the law is sufficient to justify equitable tolling of limitations”) (citation omitted). Third, even if Krasna’s waiver analysis were appropriate here, plaintiffs have submitted no evidence that they were in fact unaware of their rescission rights until after the two-year window had passed. Unadorned representations of counsel in a summary judgment brief are not a substitute for appropriate record evidence. See generally Nieves v. University of Puerto Rico, 7 F.3d 270, 276 (1st Cir.1993) (“Factual assertions by counsel in motion papers, memoranda, briefs, or other such ‘self-serving’ documents, are generally insufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact at summary judgment.”); Bowden ex rel. Bowden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 124 F.Supp.2d 1228, 1236 (M.D.Ala.2000) (“opinions, allegations, and conclusory statements of counsel do not substitute for evidence”); Williams v. Saxon Mortg. Co., 2008 WL 45739, *5 n. 9 (S.D.Ala. Jan. 2, 2008) (similar).
