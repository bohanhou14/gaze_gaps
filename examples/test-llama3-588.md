**Generation:**

 Here is the rest of the case writeup:

As mentioned earlier, the court in Forward Communications Corp. v. United States, 221 Ct. Cl. 582, 608 F.2d 485 (1979), approved the use of the capitalization method for determining going-concern value. This method was also used in Jack Daniel Distillery v. United States, 180 Ct. Cl. 308, 379 F.2d 569 (1967), where the court found that the buyer and sellers specifically bargained with respect to the amount of goodwill to be included in the purchase price and that the interval between the stock purchase and the liquidation was only 19 days. Similarly, in this case, we have determined that no goodwill was transferred, but that a portion of the purchase price was attributable to the value of K-D as a going concern.

To calculate the going-concern value, we used the capitalization method, which requires us to calculate the annual earnings of K-D over a 5-year period, determine the fair market value of K-D's tangible assets, and compare K-D's actual earnings with the earnings that would be expected from a business with K-D's amount of tangible assets. We then capitalized the excess earnings attributable to intangible assets using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 20 percent.

In conclusion, we have determined that the going-concern value of K-D is $334,985, which is attributable to the value of K-D as a going concern. We have also determined the depreciable bases of the four depreciable assets, which are the buildings, machinery and equipment, tools, dies, jigs and fixtures, and office equipment and furniture. These assets are subject to depreciation under section 167(g) of the Internal Revenue Code.

In view of the foregoing, decisions will be entered under Rule 155. T.C. Memo. 1976-301. See also VGS Corp. v. Commissioner, 68 T.C. 563, 591 (1977); Conestoga Transportation Co. v. Commissioner, 17 T.C. 506, 514 (1951).

gold_text: While this Court and others have undertaken to determine the value of goodwill (see, e.g., Forward Communications Corp. v. United States, 221 Ct. Cl. 582, 608 F.2d 485 (1979); Jack Daniel Distillery v. United States, 180 Ct. Cl. 308, 379 F.2d 569 (1967)), no case has clearly addressed the issue of how to determine the amount of going-concern value. See VGS Corp. v. Commissioner, 68 T.C. 563, 593-594 (1977); Black Industries, Inc. v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1979-61. Accordingly, this appears to be a case of first impression with respect to a method for determining the amount of going-concern value. See generally the emerging literature on this issue, including Weiner, "Going Concern Value: Goodwill by Any Other Name?” 33 Tax Lawyer 183 (1980); Danzig & Robinson, "Going Concern Value Reexamined,” 11 Tax Adviser 32 (1980); Grigsby & Cotter, "Amortization of Certain Intangibles,” 30 U.S. Cal. Tax Inst. 543, 558-570 (1978).
