In the context of the given legal cases, the debtor's motion for modification of the agreement should be denied. As stated in Reference case 286 U.S. 106, "the injunction, whether right or wrong, is not subject to impeachment in its application to the conditions that existed at its making." The order of the Court, being a final order, is not to be lightly undone, and the debtor has failed to provide a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions that would justify modification.

Furthermore, the Court's decision is guided by Bankruptcy Rule 924, which incorporates Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Pursuant to Rule 60(b), the motion must be made within a reasonable time and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken. The debtor's motion was filed on September 15, 1980, which is well after the one-year mark.

Additionally, the debtor's proposal for relief from the orders of July 28th and August 11, 1980, is predicated on speculative predictions of increased sales due to the upcoming hunting season. As stated in Reference case 405 F.2d 803, "the movants must be'suffering hardship so extreme and unexpected' as to be regarded as 'victims of oppression.' " The debtor has failed to demonstrate that it is suffering hardship so extreme and unexpected that would justify modification of the Court's order.

In conclusion, the debtor's motion for modification of the agreement should be denied. The Court's order is final and should not be lightly undone. The debtor has failed to provide a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions and has failed to demonstrate that it is suffering hardship so extreme and unexpected.
