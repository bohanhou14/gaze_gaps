The case of United States v. Crosstown Liquor Mart, Inc. et al. (CAMPBELL, District Judge) involves a dispute over the validity of search warrants and seizures of property. The defendants argue that the sales they made were not violations of the internal revenue laws and that the property seized was not properly described in the warrants.

The court refers to the case of Seib v. United States (8 Cir., 150 F.2d 673) to support its conclusion that the forfeiture provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 3253) authorize the forfeiture of property for failure to pay the special tax required by law. The court also cites United States v. 3935 Cases of Distilled Spirits (D.C., 55 F.Supp. 84) to support its conclusion that the forfeiture provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 3116) apply to violations of the internal revenue laws, including the failure to pay the special tax required by law.

The court also references Kent v. United States (157 F.2d 1) and United States v. One 1942 Pontiac Sedan Automobile (D.C., 56 F.Supp. 929) to support its conclusion that the forfeiture of property is authorized under Section 3116 of the Internal Revenue Code, even where the property is not being used for an illegal purpose at the time of seizure.

In conclusion, the court holds that the search warrants and seizures of property were valid, and that the property seized is forfeitable under the Internal Revenue Code (Section 3116). The court also holds that the forfeiture provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 3253) authorize the forfeiture of property for failure to pay the special tax required by law.
