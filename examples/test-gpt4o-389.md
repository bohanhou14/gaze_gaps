Klein further argues that the trial court erred by allowing testimony that alluded to his prior criminal conduct, thereby prejudicing the jury against him. This issue arose during the cross-examination of Agent Salinas, who mentioned that Klein had stated he "had been arrested before." The trial court immediately granted Klein's motion to strike this testimony and instructed the jury to disregard the statement.

The controlling precedent supports the trial court’s handling of this situation. In 529 F.2d 1170, it was emphasized that improperly introduced prejudicial information should be curtailed effectively by proper judicial instructions to the jury. The court's prompt admonishment can neutralize any potential prejudice unless the remark is excessively prejudicial.

Similarly, in a different context as seen in 501 F.2d 1284, it was highlighted that the process of adjudicating might include the admission of prejudicial evidence if it is essential for establishing critical aspects of the government's case. However, in Klein's case, the prompt actions by the trial judge to strike the improper testimony demonstrated a commitment to fair trial principles.

Given that the trial court issued strong, timely instructions to the jury to disregard the testimony regarding Klein's past arrest, and the jury received repeated instructions on the proper evaluation of such evidence, Klein’s argument lacks sufficient grounds to establish reversible error. The trial court’s discretion in such matters is well-supported by judicial precedent, affirming that directions to disregard evidence can effectively mitigate potential prejudice. Therefore, Klein's contentions on these points do not warrant a mistrial or a reversal of his conviction.
