In determining whether the night watchman falls under the Fair Labor Standards Act, it is essential to examine the character of his work. As established in Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517, the applicability of the Act depends on whether the employee's activities are part of "the production of goods for commerce." Here, the night watchman's duties directly contribute to maintaining the security and functionality of the warehouse where goods are prepared and dispatched, demonstrating a tangible connection to interstate commerce.

Further, the principle from Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 327 U.S. 178, asserts that the character of the employee's work is pivotal. Since the night watchman patrols the warehouse, safeguards merchandise, and oversees the arrival and departure of freight trucks essential to the interstate shipment processes, his role significantly supports the commerce operation.

Thus, consistent with these precedents, the night watchman's engagement in essential activities that facilitate the flow of goods in interstate commerce brings him under the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

gold_text: Here, it is without dispute that the night watchman guards appellant’s entire premises and property, including the loading platform, the interstate shipments loaded in the freight cars and trucks, and the warehouse building in which a percentage of the coffee and rice was being prepared for interstate shipment. Under such circumstances, we are constrained to believe that the night watchman, while guarding the warehouse in which the interstate shipments were being processed for distribution, was in some measure also engaged in the “production of goods for commerce”, within the coverage of the Act.
