In the given reference cases, 248 F. 944 and 222 F. 950, it is evident that the court has emphasized the importance of brevity and simplicity in pleadings. In Equity Rule 25, it is stated that a bill in equity should contain a short and simple statement of the ultimate facts upon which the plaintiff seeks relief, omitting any mere statement of evidence.

In the case of 248 F. 944, the court held that allegations of due diligence might have been stated in more concrete form, but it is not fatal to the pleadings to plead in detail the due diligence on the plaintiff's part. The court also stated that facts which excuse the plaintiff from laches are properly pleaded in a bill asking equitable relief and may be proven upon the trial.

In the case of 222 F. 950, the court discussed the importance of brevity and simplicity in pleadings. The court stated that rule 25 is not an absolute direction of all that a bill should contain, but rather a statement of what shall be sufficient to sustain a bill. The court also suggested that the profession should lend their aid to the end of brevity and simplicity in pleadings.

In the given case, it is clear that the plaintiff's complaint fails to comply with Equity Rule 25. The complaint sets forth detailed evidence and does not provide a short and simple statement of the ultimate facts upon which the plaintiff seeks relief. The complaint is overly detailed and does not provide the defendant with a clear understanding of the facts.

Therefore, based on the reference cases and the court's guidance, I recommend that the complaint be dismissed due to its failure to comply with Equity Rule 25.

gold_text: 1 cannot see the bearing of that section on the question here in issue. That relates merely to the matter of damages, and, if the plaintiff gets as far as an interlocutory decree herein, it would be entirely possible to show in the accounting proceeding such facts as would justify treble damages. The case of Foster v. Callaghan & Co. (D. C.) 248 F. 944, can readily be distinguished from the present pleading; and Pittsburgh Water Heater Co. v. Beler Water Heater Co. (D. C.) 222 F. 950, 953, decided shortly after the new rules went into effect, was in effect a statement that the aim of the rule (i. e., Equity Rule 25) is “brevity and simplicity of allegations in bills, and the profession should lend their aid to such end.” Later authorities cited in this opinion, as I have indicated, take a stricter view of the rule.
