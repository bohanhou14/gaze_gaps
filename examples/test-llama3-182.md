 Here is the answer:

The court must determine whether Aeron has shown the requisite elements for intervention as of right. The first element is timeliness, which Aeron has demonstrated. The second element is an interest relating to the subject matter of the action, which Aeron has also shown. The interest must be based on a right that belongs to the proposed intervenor rather than to an existing party in the suit, and must be so direct that the applicant would have a right to maintain a claim for the relief sought (Keith v. Daley, 764 F.2d 1265, 1268 (7th Cir.) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 980, 106 S.Ct. 383, 88 L.Ed.2d 336 (1985)). 

Aeron has not demonstrated a direct and substantial interest in the subject matter of the action because it is not a third-party beneficiary of the contract between Northwest and Midway. The parties to the contract did not intend to confer a direct benefit on Aeron (Altevogt v. Brinkoetter, 85 Ill.2d 44, 51 Ill.Dec. 674, 421 N.E.2d 182 (1981)). 

However, Aeron has shown an interest in the subject matter of the action because it could maintain an independent action for breach of contract or fraud against Northwest. 

The court finds that Aeron has not shown a sufficient impairment of its interest by the disposition of the adversary proceeding. The potential intervenor must show the presence of additional factors that would give the decision in the instant case compelling persuasive force in later litigation (National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Continental Illinois Corporation, 113 F.R.D. 532 (N.D.Ill.1986)). 

In the instant case, Aeron's claims consist of breach of contract and fraud, state law claims which would be heard in state court unless federal court jurisdiction exists based on diversity of citizenship. The only other additional factor cited by Aeron as one that would have compelling persuasive force in later litigation is the fact that Bankruptcy Judge Squires, before whom the instant adversary proceeding is pending, was the judge presiding at the October 8, 1991 hearing during which the contract was allegedly formed or at least the terms of the alleged contract between Northwest and Midway were discussed. However, this factor standing alone would not

gold_text: Aeron argues that its interests conflict with Midway’s interests because the Trustee, as a fiduciary of the estate, is obligated to attempt to direct recovery into the estate. Aeron argues that if recovery goes to the estate, as opposed to Aeron directly based on a third-party beneficiary claim, that recovery may be diluted by claims of other creditors of the estate. Aeron then disputes the authority cited by the bankruptcy judge in support of his holding that the Trustee adequately represented Aeron’s interest. The bankruptcy judge cited Koch Refining v. Farmers Union Central Exchange, Inc., 831 F.2d 1339 (7th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 906, 108 S.Ct. 1077, 99 L.Ed.2d 237 (1988), which held that a trustee in bankruptcy has a duty to bring claims on behalf of the creditors as a body. Aeron notes that Koch also emphasized that a trustee could not pursue independent claims of creditors:
