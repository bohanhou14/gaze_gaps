In reviewing Cruz’s petition, it’s imperative to consider whether the BIA deviated from established precedents without providing a principled reason. Notably, 286 F.3d 696 underscores that an agency can act arbitrarily if it departs from its established precedents without proper explanation. The BIA’s failure to address the impact of Cruz’s vacated conviction on his removability indicates a potential oversight of its obligation to adhere to its precedent in Pickering, as mandated by Pinho v. Gonzales.

Furthermore, analogous to the situation in Fertilizer Inst. v. Browner, 163 F.3d 774, where the EPA was scrutinized for altering its stance without adequate explanation, the BIA must elucidate its rationale when handling exceptional circumstances like Cruz’s vacated conviction. The principles set forth in Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm also require that the agency provides a reasoned analysis when deviating from prior rules.

Additionally, the criteria for the discretionary denial of relief, as highlighted in 74 F.3d 1 and 70 F.3d 447, elucidate the necessity for comprehensive explanation when adjudicating relief requests. The absence of detailed reasoning in the BIA’s decision suggests an incomplete evaluation, warranting a remand for further consideration. Thus, consistent with administrative law principles, the BIA should readdress Cruz’s motion with a clear application of Pickering to determine his conviction status for immigration purposes.

gold_text: Though we do not decide whether, as Cruz suggests, the BIA has established a “general policy” of reopening proceedings where a conviction is alleged to be invalid under Pickering, we are having difficulty squaring the BIA’s cursory treatment of Cruz’s predicament with its practice in every other case we have examined that presents the same issue. See supra note 3. While the unpublished BIA decisions we have consulted are not necessarily in the category of “selected decisions ... designated to serve as precedents in all proceedings involving the same issue or issues,” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(g), agencies should not move away from their previous rulings without cogent explanation. See Johnson v. Ashcroft, 286 F.3d 696, 700 (3d Cir.2002) (“Although an agency can change or adapt its policies, it acts arbitrarily if it departs from its established precedents without ‘announcing a principled reason’ for the departure.” (quoting Fertilizer Inst. v. Brouner, 163 F.3d 774, 778 (3d Cir.1998))); Henry v. INS, 74 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1996) (“[Ajdministrative agencies must apply the same basic rules to all similarly situated supplicants.”); Salameda v. INS, 70 F.3d 447, 450 (7th Cir.1995) (“Agencies do not have the same freedom as courts to change direction without acknowledging and justifying the change.”). Where there is a consistent pattern of administrative decisions on a given issue, we would expect the BIA to conform to that pattern or explain its departure from it. Cf. Haoud, 350 F.3d at 207 (remanding case to BIA for “fail[ure] to render a decision consistent with or fully explained as reasonably departing from its own precedent”). Should the Board determine on remand that Cruz is no longer “convicted” under the INA, we would expect it to reopen his proceedings despite the untimeliness of his motion, as it has routinely done in other cases where a conviction was vacated under Pickering, or at least explain logically its unwillingness to do so.
