The case involves Mitsubishi Electronics America, Inc. (MELA) and the United States Customs Service (Customs). MELA imported 64K Dynamic Random Access Memory components (64K DRAMs) from Japan into the United States.

The Court of International Trade (CIT) denied MELA's protest of the antidumping duty rate, but granted its protest of the interest assessment. MELA appealed the denial of its rate protest to the CIT, which held that section 1581(a) did not apply because Customs did not make an "antidumping 'decision'" within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. § 1514(a).

The CIT also held that it lacked jurisdiction under section 1581(a) because Customs did not make a "decision" regarding the antidumping duty rate. The CIT relied on 19 U.S.C. § 1514(a) and the case law, including 840 F.2d 912, which held that Customs does not make "antidumping 'decisions'."

In the alternative, MELA argued that the CIT had jurisdiction under section 1581(i), which provides jurisdiction over "any civil action commenced against the United States, its agencies, or its officers, that arises out of any law of the United States providing for—(1) revenue from imports or tonnage; (2) tariffs, duties, fees, or other taxes on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the raising of revenues; (3) embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the protection of the public health or safety; or (4) administration and enforcement with respect to the matters referred to in paragraphs (1)-(3) of this subsection and subsections (a)-(h) of this section."

The CIT held that the automatic assessment of antidumping duties under 19 C.F.R. § 353.53a(d)(1) (1987) triggered the jurisdiction under section 1581(i). However, the CIT also held that MELA's claim was barred by the statute of limitations, which requires that section 1581(i) actions be brought within two years after accrual of the cause of action.

The CIT relied on 301 F.2d 674, which held that a claim accrues when "the agg

gold_text: MELA’s section 1514(a) protest did not toll the statute of limitations during the pendency of the protest. An administrative proceeding does not toll the limitations period unless the proceeding is a mandatory prerequisite to filing suit. Omni U.S.A., Inc. v. United States, 663 F.Supp. 1130, 1133 n. 7 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1987), aff'd, 840 F.2d 912 (Fed.Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 817, 109 S.Ct. 56, 102 L.Ed.2d 34 (1988); Lipp v. United States, 301 F.2d 674, 675, 157 Ct.Cl. 197 (Ct.Cl.1962), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 932, 83 S.Ct. 1540, 10 L.Ed.2d 691 (1963). Filing an administrative protest with Customs was not a prerequisite to MELA’s suit under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i). Further, the Court of International Trade properly held that MELA could not make a section 1514 protest as a matter of law. Mitsubishi, 848 F.Supp. at 203.
