Based on the reference cases, we can analyze the situation and provide a clear answer.

In the case 420 U.S. 332, the Supreme Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the government from appealing a judgment of acquittal, unless the appeal would not require the resolution of further factual issues by the trier of fact.

In the case 476 U.S. 140, the Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a second sentencing hearing, unless there would be no proceeding after a successful appeal that would require the resolution of further factual issues by the trier of fact.

In the case 430 U.S. 564, the Court held that the government's appeal from a judgment of acquittal is not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, unless the appeal would require the resolution of further factual issues by the trier of fact.

Based on these cases, we can conclude that the government's appeal from the judgments of acquittal is not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, as the appeal would not require the resolution of further factual issues by the trier of fact.

Therefore, the government's appeal from the judgments of acquittal is allowed, and the judgments of acquittal are reversed.

gold_text: . In Burns, we relied on the reasoning similar to that used in United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975), where the Supreme Court held that the government can appeal a postverdict judgment of acquittal ordered because of pretrial delay. The Court reasoned in Wilson that an appeal under that circumstance would not result in the defendant being twice placed in jeopardy because if the appellate court reversed the trial court, the juryâ€™s verdict could be reinstated without further factfinding proceedings. Id. at 352, 95 S.Ct. at 1026. Since Wilson, the Court has continued to emphasize that the evil against which the double jeopardy clause protects is postacquittal exposure of the defendant to further factfinding proceedings. See, e.g., Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U.S. 140, 145 & n. 8, 106 S.Ct. 1745, 1749 & n. 8, 90 L.Ed.2d 116 (1986); United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977).
