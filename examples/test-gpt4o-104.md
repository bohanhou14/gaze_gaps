Appellant contends that the district court committed reversible error by providing erroneous jury instructions related to her ADA claim and that these instructions misled the jury about the correct legal standard. However, our review of the record indicates that the jury instructions, when read as a whole, adequately presented the issues in a fair and evenhanded manner, aligning with legal precedent.

We review jury instructions de novo and will reverse only if the appellant demonstrates that an error was prejudicial in light of the entire charge. As established in 774 F.3d 140, "A jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law." This standard ensures that any errors must have had a substantial influence on the jury’s verdict to warrant a new trial.

In this case, the district court's instructions were consistent with the guidelines set in Perry v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 115 F.3d 143, which states, "A party is not entitled to have the court give the jury an instruction for which there is no evidentiary predicate at trial." The court correctly instructed jurors on the applicable elements of the ADA, thereby avoiding any prejudicial misstatement of the law. Additionally, as noted in Lore v. City of Syracuse, 670 F.3d 127, "An omission, or an incomplete instruction, is less likely to be prejudicial than a misstatement of the law." Therefore, any minor omissions in the instructions did not mislead the jury or prejudice the appellant's case.

Upon reviewing the instructions in their entirety and considering them alongside the evidence presented, we conclude that they did not mislead the jury or result in an unfair trial. Consequently, the district court did not err in its jury instructions, and the appellant's claim on this ground is without merit.
