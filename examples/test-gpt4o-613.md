**Generation:**

The Trustee seeks an award of pre-judgment interest on the $28,541.31 recoverable amount. Both parties, based on mutual agreement, have stipulated that the appropriate date to begin accruing prejudgment interest is the Petition Date, February 14, 2013. The Court concurs and adopts this date (see Reference case 439 B.R. 84). 

Furthermore, the appropriate rate of prejudgment interest should be determined. While the Boulder Defendants suggested the federal judgment rate on the commencement date (see Reference case 439 B.R. 84), the applicable rate in this case should be the federal interest rate prescribed for such instances, as established in precedent (see Reference case 356 B.R. 327). The Court, therefore, awards prejudgment interest at the federal rate from the Petition Date.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, the Trustee’s Motion for Summary Judgment is granted. The Trustee is entitled to recover the sum of $28,541.31, plus prejudgment interest at the federal rate from February 14, 2013. Trustee’s counsel is directed to settle an appropriate order on five days’ notice.

gold_text: The Trustee requests prejudgment interest from the date of the Complaint in an amount to be determined by the Court. Although the Bankruptcy Code does not expressly provide for an award of pre-judgment interest in an action commenced under section 547, courts rely on the word “value” in section 560(a) as authorizing an award of interest. See McHale v. Boulder Capital LLC (In re 1031 Tax Group, LLC), 439 B.R. 84, 87 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2010). The award of prejudgment interest is discretionary, and “absent a sound reason to deny prejudgment interest, such interest should be awarded.” See id.; see also Buchwald Capital Advisors LLC v. Metl-Span I., Ltd. (In re Pameco Corp.), 356 B.R. 327, 342 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2006). The purpose of awarding pre-judgment interest in an action to recover a preferential transfer “is to restore the estate to the full value of the asset transferred in order to compensate it for the loss of time value of the asset.” In re Pameco Corp., 356 B.R. at 342. Based on the circumstances of this case, prejudgment interest is awarded at the Federal rate from the date of the Complaint (January 28, 2015).
