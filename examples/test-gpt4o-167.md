III
Petito contends that the district court erred by denying his motions for discovery of the wiretap supporting papers and a hearing on the validity of the wiretap order. This argument is comparable to the rejected claim in United States v. Morales, 566 F.2d 402 (2d Cir. 1977). As in Morales, the court in Petito's case conducted an in camera inspection of the wiretap order and found it facially valid. Moreover, appellant's assertion that he should be excused from answering questions due to possible illegal wiretaps fails to align with precedents. In 529 F.2d 770, the court found no merit in similar assertions regarding wiretaps, reinforcing that the adequacy of court orders suffices for compliance.

IV
Finally, Petito challenges the fairness of his trial due to the unavailability of May 4, 1978, photographs and surveillance reports. This contention mirrors the situation in 491 F.2d 1156, where the failure to produce surveillance materials did not merit a new trial. The court in the previous case determined that inadvertent nonproduction only necessitates a retrial if it could create reasonable doubt, which was not the case here. Dunn's consistent and credible testimony regarding Petito’s identification was sufficiently convincing to uphold the conviction.

For these reasons, and considering our review of the additional claims which lack substantive merit, we affirm the district court's judgment.

CONCLUSION
The judgment of the district court is hereby affirmed.

gold_text: On appeal we noted that the determination of facial validity at an in camera examination was sufficient to require an individual to answer grand jury questions. Morales, 566 F.2d at 406; In re Millow, 529 F.2d 770, 773 (2d Cir. 1976); In re Persico, 491 F.2d 1156 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 924, 95 S.Ct. 199, 42 L.Ed.2d 158 (1974). We held that there was no right to a suppression hearing since the criminal contempt proceeding, although occurring after the grand jury had disbanded, was so intimately connected with that grand jury as to be a “part of those proceedings.” Morales, 566 F.2d at 408. Thus, in the instant case appellant did not have the right to discovery of the wiretap order and its supporting papers, or to a suppression hearing on the propriety of its issuance.
