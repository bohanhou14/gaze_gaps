Moreover, in challenging the district court's findings, Mil fails to present a compelling argument that would warrant a different outcome. Certification of the factual ambiguities, as discussed in 7 F.3d 270, is not applicable here due to the thorough record established at trial. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court typically rejects certifications where factual issues remain undeveloped. See Pan Am. Computer Corp. v. Data Gen. Corp., 112 P.R. Dec. 780, 788 (1982).

Mil's attempt to assert that Aljoma and Sterling should be held liable similarly falters under scrutiny. As noted in 857 F.2d 4, the plaintiff, having chosen the federal forum, is ill-positioned to seek certification post-hoc just because the federal court's findings were unfavorable. This reflection aligns with the precedent that encourages judicial efficiency and discourages duplicative legal efforts. See Cantwell v. University of Massachusetts, 551 F.2d 879, 880 (1st Cir.1977).

Ultimately, the findings regarding the lack of protected distributorship rights and Aljoma's unawareness of any such rights are rooted in the evidence presented, and thus, we affirm them on the basis of clear error review. The district court's judgment is thereby upheld.

gold_text: There is one remaining loose end. MII requests for the first time on appeal that we certify a question as to the meaning and scope of Law 75 to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. We deny that request. MII chose a federal forum and eschewed any request to the district court for certification. Even in far more auspicious circumstances, we have not been receptive to requests for certification newly asserted on appeal, see, e.g., Nieves v. Univ. of P.R., 7 F.3d 270, 278 (1st Cir.1993), and here, the district courtâ€™s supportable factual finding that no protected distributorship rights existed undermines the argument that some unsettled issue of Puerto Rico law might be controlling. Under these inauspicious circumstances, we once again refuse a belated request for certification. See, e.g., id.; Fischer v. Bar Harbor Banking & Trust Co., 857 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir.1988).
