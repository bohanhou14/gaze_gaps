gold_text: Slightly more deference is given to HHS when construing the Social Security Act. Given the complexity of the Social Security Act, Title IV of which contains TANF, courts have stated there is a special need to defer to the Secretary’s interpretation. See Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U.S. 34, 43, 101 S.Ct. 2633, 69 L.Ed.2d 460 (1981); see also Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento v. Shalala, 38 F.3d 1225, 1229 (D.C.Cir.1994). (recognizing “heightened deference to the Secretary’s interpretation” of a complex and regulatory program like Medicare); White v. Shalala, 7 F.3d 296, 300 (2d Cir.1993) (because of the Act’s “byzantine construction” courts should give deference -to the Secretary’s interpretation of the Act “as long as it is a permissible interpretation”); Friedman v. Berger, 547 F.2d 724, 727 n. 7 (2d Cir.1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 984, 97 S.Ct. 1681, 52 L.Ed.2d 378 (1977) ( Friendly, J.) (commenting that the Act and its regulations are “almost unintelligible' to the uninitiated”).
