In evaluating the arguments submitted by the plaintiff concerning the waiver or estoppel of the policy's time limitation provisions, it is essential to examine established legal principles. The case of Fidelity, etc., Co., 19 F.2d 110, 112 outlines that "reasonable provisions in an insurance policy limiting the time for suit thereon are valid, and unless waived, are binding upon the parties." The plaintiff bears the burden of proving that such a waiver occurred. The requirements for a waiver or estoppel include intentional misleading acts or promises from the insurer, where the plaintiff was turned from legal action due to such misleading conduct (19 F.2d 110). 

Furthermore, in case 152 F.2d 239, the court affirmed that mere negotiations to amicably resolve a controversy do not constitute a waiver or estoppel unless there is clear evidence of concealments, promises to pay, bad faith, or misrepresentations by the insurer. The absence of such allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint here suggests a lack of substantial proof for waiver. 

In the current case, negotiations between Mr. Kushinsky and Mr. Foster ceased by December 2, 1942, leaving the plaintiff ample time, specifically until May 31, 1943, to commence legal proceedings. Consequently, aligning with the principles delineated in 152 F.2d 239 and 19 F.2d 110, the court finds no basis for waiver or estoppel that would negate the policy’s limitation period.

Therefore, under these precedents, the claim that the insurer waived the twelve-month limitation due to negotiation or implied promises cannot be sustained, and the plaintiff’s failure to act within the prescribed period is conclusive.

gold_text: The rule regarding waiver is aptly expressed in the cases of Continental Ins. Co. v. Fire Ass’n, 6 Cir., 1945, 152 F.2d 239; and Reynolds v. Detroit Fidelity & Surety Co., 6 Cir., 1927, 19 F.2d 110, wherein waivers of the time for bringing suit wat claimed. In the former case the complaint alleged negotiations in an endeavor to arrive at an amicable disposition, and the court stated: “We think the District Judge was right in holding that mere negotiations in an endeavor to arrive at an amicable disposition of a controversy are insufficient basis for the application of the doctrine of waiver or estoppel. It is noteworthy that there are in the complaint no allegations of promises to pay, concealment, bad faith, fraud, misrepresentation or other facts which might be construed as an attempt to mislead plaintiff’s assignor or to lull it into a sense of security, or into the belief that payment of any amount would be made by defendant. There is no allegation, direct or inferential, of intention by plaintiff’s assignor to commence suit within the period limited by the policy and of its being turned from that course of action by misleading acts or promises by the defendant. No facts are alleged from which an inference might be drawn that the postponement of the suit was at the express or implied request of the defendant, or that there was an intentional delay in adjustment until after the limitation period provided in the policy had passed.” 152 F.2d 239, 240.
