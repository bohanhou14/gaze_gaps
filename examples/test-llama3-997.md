In this case, the petitioner argues that his sentence was disproportionate and based upon incorrectly scored sentencing guidelines. He claims that the trial court relied upon impermissible factors in determining his sentence, including the trial court's assessment of his character as a "social psychopath" who was likely to kill. The petitioner also argues that the sentencing court considered information obtained in connection with the proceedings of his co-defendants, which he claims was not disclosed to him.

The court has held that a sentence imposed on the basis of "misinformation of constitutional magnitude" violates due process. See Tucker v. United States, 404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972). However, in this case, the petitioner has not shown that the sentencing court relied upon materially false information. See Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003).

The Supreme Court has held that a federal court should analyze a claim for habeas corpus relief under the "unreasonable application" clause of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) "when a state-court decision unreasonably applies the law of this Court to the facts of a prisoner's case." Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). The court has also held that a sentence imposed on the basis of "grossly disproportionate" punishment is unconstitutional. See Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991).

In this case, the petitioner has not shown that his sentence was grossly disproportionate. The trial court's sentence was within the statutory maximum, and the court considered the petitioner's criminal history and the nature of the offense in determining his sentence. The court's sentence was not based upon an unreasonable application of federal law. See McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 95 L.Ed.2d 262 (1987).

The petitioner's claims are procedurally defaulted because he failed to present them to the Michigan Supreme Court in his application for leave to appeal.

gold_text: A plurality of the Supreme Court has held that the Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality between the crime and sentence. See Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 965, 111 S.Ct. 2680. As the Supreme Court observed in Lockyer, it is generally recognized after Harmelin that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment forbids only an extreme disparity between crime and sentence, that is, sentences that are “grossly disproportionate” to the crime.
