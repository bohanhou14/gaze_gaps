Based on the principles established in reference cases, the standard for determining fraudulent joinder requires the removing party to show that there is no possibility the plaintiff could establish a cause of action against the in-state defendant in state court or that there has been outright fraud in the pleadings (893 F.2d 98; 882 F.2d 187). In evaluating claims of fraudulent joinder, the Court must resolve all disputed questions of fact and ambiguities in the controlling state law in favor of the plaintiff (893 F.2d 98; 882 F.2d 187). 

Here, Miles argues that the plaintiffs' procedural failure to convene a medical-review panel before filing suit against the nondiverse defendants, Dr. Andres and Tulane, constitutes fraudulent joinder. However, procedural prematurity does not negate the substantive merit of the plaintiffs' claims under state law (893 F.2d 98). The Court's task is to determine whether the plaintiffs have a viable claim that could impose liability on the nondiverse defendants if the evidence supports their assertions (882 F.2d 187).

Given that the plaintiffs have stated a viable cause of action which could result in liability for Dr. Andres or Tulane, fraudulent joinder is not present simply due to procedural defects (893 F.2d 98). Therefore, complete diversity is lacking, and as a result, the plaintiffs' motion to remand is warranted. Consequently, the plaintiffs' motion to remand is GRANTED.
