Based on the reference cases, it is clear that the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Act (M.G.L. c. 152) provides the exclusive remedy for workplace injuries, including those caused by an employer's intentional or fraudulent misrepresentations. In Kotler v. General Electric Co., 926 F.2d 1217 (1st Cir. 1991), the court held that the Act's exclusivity provision bars an employee's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against their employer, even if the employer's conduct was flagrantly wrong.

Similarly, in Woods v. Friction Materials, 30 F.3d 255 (1st Cir. 1994), the court ruled that the Act's exclusivity provision extends to claims of intentional workplace torts, including fraudulent misrepresentations by an employer's medical personnel. The court held that the Act's willful misconduct provision (M.G.L. c. 152, § 28) applies to intentional torts committed by an employer, regardless of whether the tort was committed by supervisory personnel or a co-worker.

In both cases, the courts emphasized the importance of following the Massachusetts legislature's intent in enacting the Workers' Compensation Act, which is to provide a comprehensive and exclusive remedy for workplace injuries. The courts also noted that the Act's exclusivity provision is designed to ensure that employees do not have to choose between pursuing a claim under the Act or in a separate tort action.

In light of these precedents, it is clear that the plaintiffs' claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty against General Electric are barred by the exclusivity provision of the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Act. The court must therefore dismiss the claims.

gold_text: As the First Circuit has frequently noted, it is not a diversity court’s proper place to blaze new and unprecedented trails in state jurisprudence. Kotler v. American Tobacco Co., 926 F.2d 1217, 1224 (1st Cir.1990). This maxim is especially applicable here where a ruling in plaintiffs’ favor would carve out a judicial exception without precedent to the exclusive remedial provision of the Workers’ Compensation Act. See Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc., 30 F.3d 255, 263 (1st Cir.1994) (absent extreme circumstances federal courts are bound by the constructions placed upon state statutes by state courts).
