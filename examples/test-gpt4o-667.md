As established in the references 372 U.S. 293 and 449 U.S. 539, a federal habeas court must grant an evidentiary hearing if specific criteria are met, such as the factual dispute not being resolved in the state court hearing or the state factual determination not being fairly supported by the record. 

Appellant’s argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel was adequately addressed by the state court, which conducted a hearing to examine this claim. In accordance with the standards set in reference case 372 U.S. 293, the state court provided a full and fair hearing to assess the effectiveness of trial counsel. Trial counsel’s decisions, such as not calling Higgins or Robinson to testify, were deemed tactical. It is important to note that Higgins and Robinson had prior statements implicating the appellant, which would have adversely affected the defense.

Moreover, the state court complied with the criteria from reference case 449 U.S. 539, ensuring that the factual disputes were addressed and giving proper jurisdiction over the matter. While the appellant claimed he did not adopt the confessions of his accomplices, the adoptive confession was properly evaluated as circumstantial evidence at the state level, supported by sufficient indicia of reliability, as required.

In conclusion, applying the principles from the referenced cases, the federal court finds no grounds for habeas relief based on the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel since the state court’s factual determinations were fairly supported and met constitutional standards. The overall procedural fairness was upheld, negating the necessity for federal habeas intervention.

gold_text: The state court post-conviction proceeding provided appellant with a hearing at which the material facts were developed and the merits of the factual dispute were resolved. No new evidence was presented to the District Court or to this Court. The hearing provided in the state court was a full and fair hearing. No further hearing on the issue of the effective assistance of counsel is required. See Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 312-13, 83 S.Ct. 745, 756-57, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963) (standards for when a hearing in federal court reviewing a petition for habeas corpus from state court conviction is required). Moreover, the determination by the state court is presumed to be correct in a federal habeas court unless this Court determines the record as a whole does not support the factual determination or appellant proves by clear and convincing evidence that the factual determination was erroneous. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d); Sumner v. Mata, 449 U.S. 539, 545, 101 S.Ct. 764, 768, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981).
