**Generation:**

In the present case, we observe a critical distinction highlighted in both `351 F.3d 1381` and `371 F.3d 1362`—the applicability of equitable tolling principles and the definition of a "prevailing party" under EAJA. In Vaughn, `351 F.3d 1381`, the court emphasized that the remand must confer at least some relief on the merits of the claimant’s request. This aligns with our examination here, where the Veterans’ Court did not retain jurisdiction and instructed the Board to dismiss, signifying a material change in procedural posture as per Former Employees of Motorola, `336 F.3d 1360`. No substantive adjudication from the Veterans' Court on the merits differentiates this case from situations where the court maintains jurisdiction or the remand is purely procedural without relief or enforceable judgment on the merits (`371 F.3d 1362`).

Thereby, based on `371 F.3d 1362` and `351 F.3d 1381`, this remand must be viewed as materially altering the legal relationship between Halpern and the Government. Halpern is thus a "prevailing party" under EAJA, meriting consideration for attorney’s fees due to the favorable procedural directive altering his standing with respect to the compensation at issue. 

In conclusion, we reverse the Veterans’ Court’s determination that Halpern was not a prevailing party and remand for the determination of appropriate fees under EAJA.

gold_text: Our jurisdiction in veterans cases is limited by statute. See 38 U.S.C. § 7292(d)(2) (2000). We have recognized, however, that where adoption of a particular legal standard dictates the outcome of a case based on undisputed facts, we may address that issue as a question of law. Brandenburg v. Principi, 371 F.3d 1362, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2004); Bailey v. Principi, 351 F.3d 1381, 1384 (Fed.Cir.2003) (“[W]hen the material facts are not in dispute and the adoption of a particular legal standard would dictate the outcome of the equitable tolling claim, this court has treated the question of the availability of equitable tolling as a matter of law that we are authorized by statute to address”). Given the standards for prevailing party status articulated above, the undisputed facts in this case dictate the outcome.
