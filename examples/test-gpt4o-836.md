The district court also dismissed Pool's claim as frivolous. This dismissal might be an error. According to established precedents, an action can be dismissed as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) only if it is beyond doubt that the petitioner can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief (699 F.2d 434; 741 F.2d 209). Furthermore, the complaint of a pro se prisoner should not be considered frivolous unless it appears beyond doubt that petitioner can prove no set of facts in support of his claim (Wilson v. Iowa, 636 F.2d 1166, 1168 (8th Cir.1981)). Pool's allegation of insufficient staffing in HU-4, if proven, could potentially substantiate his claim, thus meriting further examination rather than a summary dismissal. The proper course would have been to allow the action to be docketed and, if necessary, dismissed at a later stage (699 F.2d 434).

Consequently, we reverse the district court's dismissal of Count 1 on grounds of frivolousness and remand for further proceedings consistent with these findings.
