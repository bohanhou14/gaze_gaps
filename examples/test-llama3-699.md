II. ISSUES:

A. Thompson claims that the seizure of his truck, and the subsequent inventory search, were conducted improperly. In United States v. LaGuardia, 774 F.2d 317, 320 (8th Cir.1985), we held that "possession" for purposes of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) may be either actual or constructive. Constructive possession exists when a person does not have actual possession but instead knowingly has the power and the intention at some point to exercise dominion over the substance. In this case, the record contains sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that Thompson had constructive possession of the cocaine found in his truck.

Similarly, the inventory search of the truck was conducted in accordance with customary police practice. See Florida v. Meyers, 466 U.S. 380, 104 S.Ct. 1852, 80 L.Ed.2d 381 (1984). The evidence discovered was obtained through a proper inventory search, conducted reasonably and in good faith, and done in accordance with customary police practice in that department.

B. Thompson also claims that the $3,400 found on his person when he was arrested was improperly admitted into evidence because its seizure lacked probable cause. In United States v. Taylor, 728 F.2d 864, 868 (7th Cir.1984), we held that probable cause to arrest a suspect without a warrant exists if the "facts and circumstances within the officer's knowledge... are sufficient to warrant a prudent person, or one of reasonable caution, in believing, in the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense."

In this case, the evidence suggests that Thompson had a significant amount of unexplained cash on his person, which is a common indicator of illegal activity. See United States v. Runyon, 621 F.2d 317, 318 (8th Cir.1980). Additionally, the circumstances of the arrest, including the presence of cocaine and drug paraphernalia in the truck, provide additional probable cause for the seizure of the cash.

gold_text: The admissibility of the $3,400, however, hinges not on the validity of the arrest, but on the currency’s relationship to the arrest. Thompson was subsequently indicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and distribution of cocaine. Thus, establishing Thompson’s intent to distribute was essential to the government’s case at trial. This Court has consistently held that intent to distribute may be proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence and may be inferred from such things as large quantities of drugs, large sums of unexplained currency, and the presence of firearms. United States v. Matra, 841 F.2d 837 (8th Cir.1988); United States v. Shurn, 849 F.2d 1090, 26 Fed.R.Evid.Serv. 123 (8th Cir.1988). Thompson’s innocent explanation for the presence of this money was rejected by the court and jury below. We shall do likewise.
