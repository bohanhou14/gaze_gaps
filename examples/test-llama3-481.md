The legal cases of Wilson (90 B.R. 241), Flaherty (10 B.R. 118), and Dekalb Bank (800 F.2d 446) provide valuable insights into the nature of guarantees and conditional guarantees. These cases highlight the importance of understanding the terms and conditions of a guarantee agreement to determine the rights and responsibilities of the guarantor.

In the case of Dekalb Bank, the court held that a conditional guaranty enables the creditor to seek payment from the guarantor only after the occurrence of some condition, such as the creditor's unsuccessful and reasonable efforts to collect the debt from the principal debtor. Similarly, the case of Wilson emphasizes that an absolute guaranty ceases to be contingent upon the principal obligor's default, and the guarantor is liable for the debt regardless of the principal's ability to pay.

In contrast, the case of Flaherty highlights the distinction between an absolute guaranty and a conditional guaranty. The court held that a conditional guaranty requires notice of the primary obligor's default before the guarantor is obligated to pay.

In the context of the present case, it is clear that the guaranty agreement executed by the Pfankuchs contains an absolute guaranty clause, which obligates the guarantors to pay the debt regardless of the Corporation's ability to pay. Therefore, based on the legal cases cited above, it can be concluded that the Pfankuchs are liable for the debt owed by the Corporation to the Mall, and their guaranty agreement is not conditional upon the Corporation's default.

In conclusion, the legal cases of Wilson, Flaherty, and Dekalb Bank provide valuable insights into the nature of guarantees and conditional guarantees. By understanding the terms and conditions of a guarantee agreement, it is possible to determine the rights and responsibilities of the guarantor. In the present case, the absolute guaranty clause in the Pfankuchs' agreement obligates them to pay the debt regardless of the Corporation's ability to pay, and their guaranty agreement is not conditional upon the Corporation's default. <answer>

gold_text: Despite purporting to condition the Pfankuch’s liability upon the Mall’s demand for payment, the only condition precedent to their liability is a default by the Corporation under the lease. If the Corporation defaulted, the Pfankuchs absolutely and unconditionally guaranteed they would make payment. Such a guaranty requires the guarantor to pay immediately upon the principal obligor’s default. In re Pulliam, 90 B.R. 241 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1988). In short, the Pfankuchs’ liability on their guaranty arose as soon as the Corporation defaulted, not upon the Corporation’s failure to cure, or the Mali’s demand for payment. See United States v. Little Joe Trawlers, Inc., 776 F.2d 1249,1253 (5th Cir.1985). Indeed, “[the] demand [for payment] serves solely as a request for payment as opposed to the creation of liability.” In re Wilson, 9 B.R. 723, 725 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1981).
