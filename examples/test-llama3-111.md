In the case of 702 F.3d 334, the court held that a sentence may be considered substantively unreasonable when the district court selects a sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor. The court also stated that a sentence may be considered substantively unreasonable when the district court fails to consider relevant sentencing factors.

In the case of 514 F.3d 508, the court held that a sentence may be considered substantively unreasonable when the district court selects a sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor. The court also stated that a sentence may be considered substantively unreasonable when the district court fails to consider relevant sentencing factors.

In the case at hand, the district court imposed a sentence of 188 months, which was within the advisory Guidelines range. The court considered several factors, including the seriousness of the offense, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the need for adequate deterrence, the need to protect the public, and the defendant's history and characteristics.

The court's decision was based on a reasoned analysis of the relevant sentencing factors, and the sentence was not arbitrary or based on impermissible factors. Therefore, the sentence was substantively reasonable.

In conclusion, the sentence imposed by the district court was substantively reasonable based on the court's reasoned analysis of the relevant sentencing factors and the fact that the sentence was within the advisory Guidelines range. The case law cited above supports this conclusion. Therefore, the sentence should be affirmed.
