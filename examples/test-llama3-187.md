The case presented is a putative class action brought by vehicle owners against the City of Chicago, alleging that the City's impoundment ordinance violates the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. The impoundment ordinance allows for the seizure and impoundment of vehicles for various vehicle-related violations, and administrative penalties are imposed on the owner for the violation.

The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, concluding that the plaintiffs failed to state a facial challenge to the impoundment ordinance under the Fourth Amendment. The court held that the ordinance does not violate the Fourth Amendment because it requires probable cause to believe that the vehicle was used in an illegal manner or in connection with an illegal act before seizing and impounding the vehicle.

The court also dismissed the plaintiffs' procedural due process claim, finding that the impoundment ordinance provides constitutionally sufficient procedural protections. The court noted that the ordinance allows for a preliminary hearing and a full hearing, and that the owner has the right to assert certain defenses to the impoundment.

The court's decision is consistent with the holdings in cases such as Morrissey v. Gilligan, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), which held that a state need not provide an evidentiary hearing prior to revoking a parole, and Sullivan v. City of Chicago, 860 F.3d 1001 (2017), which held that a city may define the defenses to a code violation and that a violation of state law alone cannot be the basis for a federal procedural due process claim.

In addition, the court's decision is consistent with the holdings in cases such as Bell v. City of Chicago, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), which held that a warrantless seizure is not per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, and Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40 (1968), which held that the question in this Court upon review of a state-approved search or seizure is not whether the search was authorized by state law, but rather whether the search was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

In conclusion, the court's decision is consistent with the holdings in the reference cases and is based on the principles of procedural due process and the Fourth Amendment. The impoundment ordinance does not violate the Fourth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause, and the plaintiffs' claims were properly dismissed.

gold_text: The plaintiffs’ state-law arguments are also misplaced. The requirement of due process “is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.” Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). The basic rights guaranteed by procedural due process are notice of the intended deprivation and an opportunity to be heard, although more elaborate procedural rights such as the right to present evidence, confront witnesses, and be represented by counsel may apply in cases where vital private interests are at risk. Simpson v. Brown Cty., 860 F.3d 1001, 1006 (7th Cir. 2017) (citing Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970)). To determine what process is due, courts evaluate procedural safeguards under the balancing test of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), which requires weighing: (1) the private interest at stake, (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation and the value- of any additional procedural safeguards; and (3) the government’s countervailing intertests. Here, the plaintiffs have entirely failed to develop any argument that the procedural safeguards under the City’s ordinance (including the opportunity for judicial review) are insufficient due process protections for impoundment and any corresponding administrative penalties. Instead, the plaintiffs emphasize that the City ordinance violated Illinois law. Even assuming that the City ordinance violates Illinois law (an issue that I do not reach), that allegation is insufficient to state a federal due process' claim. “[A] unit of state or local government does not violate the federal Constitution just because it violates a state or local law.” Garcia v. Kankakee Cty. Hous. Auth., 279 F.3d 532, 535 (7th Cir. 2002); see Colon, 899 F.2d at 672 (dismissing procedural due process claim based on plaintiffs theory that state actor violated state law).
