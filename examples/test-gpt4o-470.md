Based on these guiding principles, this Court finds that while certain categories of the Warrant’s provisions were impermissibly broad, blanket suppression is not warranted. Notably, the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Cardwell, 680 F.2d 75 (9th Cir.1982), emphasized that reliance on generic classifications without precise descriptions invites unconstitutional exploratory searches. Similarly, warrants issuing broad descriptions without specific guidance, as seen in United States v. Row, 58 F.3d 423 (9th Cir.1995) and United States v. Bright, 630 F.2d 804 (5th Cir.1980), fail to meet the particularity standard required under the Fourth Amendment.

Here, the failure to incorporate Agent Bomdstad’s Affidavit, as per requirements elucidated in United States v. Towne, 997 F.2d 537, 544 (9th Cir.1993), further underscores this deficiency. Additionally, the good faith exception cannot shield the Government from suppression given the lack of objective good faith exhibited by the agents, a concept addressed in Center Art Galleries-Hawaii, Inc. v. United States, 875 F.2d 747 (9th Cir.1989).

Therefore, applying the exclusionary rule to the overbroad provisions 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19, and 24 is appropriate. The remaining valid provisions are severable and thus admissible, echoing the decision in United States v. Gomez-Soto, 723 F.2d 649 (9th Cir.1984). Accordingly, Defendants' objections are sustained in part, and the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.

gold_text: While the Court concurs in and adopts the factual findings made by the Magistrate Judge, the Court concludes that the particular facts of this case are more closely akin to those present in United States v. Cardwell, 680 F.2d 75 (9th Cir.1982), United States v. Spilotro, 800 F.2d 959 (9th Cir.1986), and United States v. Kow, 58 F.3d 423 (9th Cir.1995). The particularity deficiencies in the Search Warrant, the failures of the supervising search agent, and the wholesale seizure of the vast majority of SDI’s documents, and computer files, including many having no relevance to the persons, entities or subject matter under investigation, lead to the conclusion that the actions of the searching agents constituted an impermissible gener al search which warrants suppression of all evidence seized.
