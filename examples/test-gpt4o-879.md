V. CONCLUSION

In sum, the Bankruptcy Court erred in summarily overruling Power Five's objection without adequate findings of fact or substantive conclusions of law. As articulated in _In re Spangler, 56 B.R. 990, 991 (D.Md.1986)_ and _Badgley v. Santacroce, 815 F.2d 888, 890 (2d Cir. 1987) (per curiam)_, a court must provide sufficient detail to permit meaningful review. The Bankruptcy Court's failure to do so necessitates vacating the order and remanding for further proceedings.

Furthermore, as in _Mid-American Waste Systems, Inc. v. City of Gary, 49 F.3d 286, 292 (7th Cir. 1995)_, subsidiary findings are essential to understand the basis of the decision. Here, the Bankruptcy Court did not address the merits of the objection, similar to how inadequate records in _Weitzman v. Stein, 897 F.2d 653, 658 (2d Cir. 1990)_ led to vacatur.

For these reasons, the Bankruptcy Court's decision to overrule Power Five’s objection is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this ruling.

SO ORDERED.
