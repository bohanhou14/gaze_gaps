Mancia further contends that the "felony" and "aggravated felony" provisions in 8 U.S.C. §§ 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional. This issue has been addressed by the Supreme Court in the cases of Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998), and Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).

In Almendarez-Torres, the Court concluded that § 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision authorizing an enhanced sentence for recidivist offenders, rather than a separate crime. Therefore, the government is not required to include the prior conviction in the indictment (523 U.S. at 226-227). Mancia's argument that this provision is unconstitutional is thus unpersuasive, as the precedent clearly supports the current statutory scheme.

In Apprendi, while the Court reexamined enhanced sentencing issues, it did not overrule Almendarez-Torres concerning prior convictions. Instead, Apprendi reaffirmed that a prior conviction does not need to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt for enhanced penalties under recidivist provisions (530 U.S. at 490).

Based on these decisions, we find no constitutional infirmity in the application of §§ 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) in Mancia’s case. Consequently, the district court did not err in applying the enhanced penalties for recidivism.

We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.

gold_text: Mancia argues for the first time on appeal that the felony and aggravated-felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional. Mancia concedes that this argument is foreclosed by Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). He nevertheless seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review in the light of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).
