I. Persecution on Account of Political Opinion

In the case of Yidong Bu, the immigration judge incorrectly denied his asylum application, finding that he was not persecuted on account of a political opinion. This conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Bu's testimony, corroborated by hospital documents and the State Department's 192 F.3d 1241 Country Report on China, demonstrates that he was persecuted for his political opinion against government corruption and his attempt to expose it.

The judge's determination is contrary to the well-established precedent in cases such as Reyes-Guerrero v. INS, 205 F.3d 1177, where it was held that refusal to accede to government corruption can constitute a political opinion for purposes of refugee status. Similarly, in Marquez v. INS, 105 F.3d 374, the court recognized that criticizing corrupt agents of the government can be a form of political opinion.

II. Imputed Political Opinion

Bu's case is also consistent with the principle that an individual can be persecuted on account of a political opinion imputed to them by the persecutor. See Desir v. Ilchert, 840 F.2d 723, where it was held that the harm suffered by the petitioner constituted persecution on account of political opinion attributed to him by the persecutor.

III. Conclusion

In light of the evidence in the record, the immigration judge's denial of Bu's asylum application must be reversed. Bu was persecuted on account of his political opinion against government corruption, and his case is supported by the well-established precedent in cases such as Reyes-Guerrero and Marquez. His persecution was not simply a result of his involvement in a strike, but rather was motivated by his political opinion and his attempt to expose government corruption.

This conclusion is also consistent with the principle that an individual can be persecuted on account of a political opinion imputed to them by the persecutor, as seen in Desir v. Ilchert. Therefore, Bu's asylum application must be granted, and he must be provided with the necessary protection and relief.

gold_text: In this case, the factual predicate for the petitioner’s asylum request is clear and uncontroverted. There is also no question that Bu has exhausted his claim that his protest of government corruption caused the persecution that he suffered. Moreover, case law supports Bu’s argument. The courts have held that whistleblowing against corrupt government officials may constitute political activity sufficient to form the basis of persecution “on account of political opinion,” as can the refusal to accede to government corruption. See, e.g., Grava v. INS, 205 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th Cir.2000) (“whistleblowing against one’s supervisors at work is not, as a matter of law, always an exercise of political opinion[,] ... [but] where the whistle blows against corrupt government officials, it may constitute political activity sufficient to form the basis of persecution on account political opinion” (citations omitted)); see also Reyes-Guerrero v. INS, 192 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.1999) (Colombian attorney who prosecuted corruption by members of the opposition party established “a causal connection between the persecution suffered by [him] and his political opinion”); Marquez v. INS, 105 F.3d 374, 381 (7th Cir.1997) (“political agitation against state corruption” can provide a basis for grant of asylum); Desir v. Ilchert, 840 F.2d 723, 727 (9th Cir.1988) (Haitian citizen who resisted extortion by the government’s semi-official security guards, the Ton Ton Macoutes, effectively “challenge[d] the underpinnings of the political system” and “bec[a]me an enemy of the government” despite his lack of overt expression of opinion).
