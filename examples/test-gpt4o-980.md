In the present case, the Park Service's interpretation of enabling legislation and its authority to regulate trapping within national parks aligns with established principles of statutory interpretation. The Supreme Court has consistently emphasized the importance of administrative agencies' longstanding and coherent constructions of statutory language, especially when Congress has not disapproved such interpretations (465 U.S. 555; North Haven Board of Education v. Bell). Furthermore, the court in National Rifle Association of America v. Potter upheld a similar regulation, affirming that the omission of specific language on trapping in enabling acts suggests congressional intent to exclude it unless explicitly authorized (456 U.S. 512).

Moreover, the Department's approach is supported by precedent indicating that congressional silence, coupled with the failure to amend specific statutes despite being aware of regulatory positions, implies legislative acquiescence (442 U.S. 544; Helvering v. Hallock). This principle was also reflected in the court's deference to administrative interpretations unless there is clear contrary legislative intent (310 U.S. 469; Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader). Therefore, the Park Service's regulation is a permissible construction consistent with congressional directives and judicial principles.

gold_text: Plaintiffs claim that the latter consideration amounts to reversible error. However, while post-enactment developments cannot be accorded the weight of contemporary legislative history, and Congress’ failure to disapprove a regulation is not dispositive of congressional intent, the district court would be remiss if it ignored evidence that implies congressional intent.

Where “an agency’s statutory construction has been ‘fully brought to the attention of the public and Congress,’ and the latter has not sought to alter that interpretation although it has amended the statute in other respects, then presumably the legislative intent has been correctly discerned.” United States v. Rutherford, 442 U.S. 544, 554, n. 10, 99 S.Ct. 2470, 2476, n. 10, 61 L.Ed.2d 68 (1979) (quoting Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 487-89, 60 S.Ct. 982, 988-89, 84 L.Ed. 1311 (1940)).
