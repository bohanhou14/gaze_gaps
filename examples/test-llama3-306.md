The case presented involves a Chinese national, Wang, who entered the United States with a false passport and sought asylum based on her fear of persecution due to her parents' resistance to China's population control policies. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied her application, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the decision.

Wang's fear of persecution is not based on her own actions, but rather on her parents' refusal to pay a fine for violating China's family planning policy. The IJ determined that Wang's parents' actions were not a political opinion, but rather a matter of economic circumstances. This decision aligns with the holding in Smugglers Petitioner's case, 92 F.3d 985, which stated that punishment for illegal departure is not considered persecution.

The IJ also found that Wang's fear of persecution was not reasonable, as she had not experienced any harm or threats since 1993. This decision is supported by the holding in Li v. Att'y Gen., 400 F.3d 157, 164-65 & n. 3, which stated that unfulfilled threats must be of a highly imminent and menacing nature to constitute persecution.

Furthermore, the IJ noted that Wang's airport statement, which was recorded through a Mandarin language interpreter, was reliable and supported her conclusion that Wang had failed to prove past persecution or a reasonable well-founded fear of future persecution. This decision is consistent with the holding in He Chun Chen v. Ashcroft, 376 F.3d 215, 223-24, which cautioned against over-reliance on an airport statement.

In conclusion, the BIA's decision to deny Wang's asylum application was supported by substantial evidence and is consistent with the holding in reference cases. Wang's fear of persecution was not based on her own actions, but rather on her parents' economic circumstances, and her fear was not reasonable given the lack of harm or threats she had experienced since 1993.

gold_text: As to the second basis for her alleged fear, although there is some evidence that Chinese individuals who illegally departed may be subjected to administrative detention or, in rare cases, fines upon their return, there is not sufficient evidence that Wang would be in that position if returned to China. “[Potential prosecution for violating [China’s] illegal departure law on its face does not give rise to a fear of persecution. ...” Si v. Slattery, 864 F.Supp. 397, 406 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (cited in Chang v. I.N.S., 119 F.3d 1055, 1063 (3d Cir.1997)); see also Li v. I.N.S., 92 F.3d 985, 988 (9th Cir.1996) (“Criminal prosecution for illegal departure is generally not considered to be persecution.”). There is nothing in this recoi'd to suggest that Wang will be prosecuted for her illegal departure while other violators will not.
