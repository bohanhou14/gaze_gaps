Petitioner alleges that the trial court's questioning of him during his testimony was improper and violated his due process rights. Specifically, he claims that the court's questioning was leading and suggestive, and that it prevented him from presenting a full and fair defense.

In reviewing this claim, we must consider the Supreme Court's holding in United States v. Murdock, 290 U.S. 389, 394, 54 S.Ct. 223, 225, 78 L.Ed. 381 (1933), which states that a federal judge may not express his personal view on the guilt or innocence of the defendant to the jury. We must also consider the Ninth Circuit's decision in Gonsior v. Craven, 449 F.2d 20 (9th Cir. 1971), which held that a state trial judge's questioning of a defendant during his testimony may be considered improper if it is likely to confuse the jury or undermine the defendant's right to present his own defense.

In this case, the trial court's questioning of petitioner was not improper. The court's questions were designed to clarify and elicit information, and they did not indicate any bias or prejudice towards the prosecution. Furthermore, the court's questioning did not prevent petitioner from presenting his defense, and he was able to present his testimony and other evidence in a way that was not prejudiced by the court's actions.

Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court's questioning of petitioner during his testimony was not improper, and that it did not violate his due process rights. This claim is denied.

gold_text: Petitioner argues that he was deprived of a fair trial when the trial court questioned him extensively during his testimony, inter alia, about the details of his confession and his use of aliases. A federal habeas court does not review a state trial judge’s behavior under the same standard that a federal appellate court would employ on direct review of a federal trial judge’s behavior. This is because “federal courts have authority under their supervisory powers to oversee the administration of criminal justice within federal courts and lack such authority with respect to state courts. The only commands that federal courts can enforce in state courts are those of the Constitution.” Daye v. Attorney General, 712 F.2d 1566, 1571 (2d Cir.1983). Thus, to prevail on a claim of judicial misconduct, petitioner must show that the state trial judge’s conduct was so fundamentally unfair as to deprive him of his constitutional right to due process. Gayle v. Scully, 779 F.2d 802, 806 (2d Cir.1985); Robinson v. Ricks, 2004 WL 1638171 (E.D.N.Y.2004). A judge does not deny a defendant due process of law merely by intervening in a trial to question witnesses. Id. It is well within the power of the trial judge to question witnesses, including the defendant. Such questioning most often occurs to test the memory of witnesses, to avoid confusion on the part of jurors, and to clarify points that are deliberately obfuscated or are simply confusing. Gayle, 779 F.2d at 813. The judge’s intervention in the conduct of a trial must be both significant and adverse to the defense to a substantial degree before the risk of impaired functioning of the jury, or lack of the appearance of a neutral judge conducting a fair trial, exceeds constitutional limits. Id. at 806; Robinson, 2004 WL 1638171, at *13.
