This case involves a First Amendment retaliation claim filed by plaintiff Jo Anna Miles against defendant Lamar Beckworth, Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). Miles alleges that Beckworth retaliated against her for testifying against her former supervisor, Thomas Bledsoe, in a criminal trial. The district court denied Beckworth's motion for summary judgment, finding that Miles had alleged sufficient facts to support her claim.

In reviewing the district court's decision, we must determine whether Beckworth's conduct violated Miles' clearly established First Amendment right to be free from retaliation for protected speech. The Supreme Court has held that government officials performing discretionary functions are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known (Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)).

The district court found that Miles had alleged sufficient facts to support her claim of retaliation, including the close timing between her testimony at Bledsoe's trial and Beckworth's decision to transfer her to a new position. The court also noted that Beckworth failed to present any argument as to how Miles' speech had a detrimental impact on the operation of DPS. We agree with the district court's finding that there are genuine issues of fact which remain and that Miles has alleged sufficient facts that, if established as true, could satisfy the elements of her First Amendment retaliation claim.

Beckworth also argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity, citing Harlow v. Fitzgerald (457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). However, we find that Beckworth's conduct violated Miles' clearly established First Amendment right to be free from retaliation for protected speech. As the Supreme Court has held, "the contours of a right are sufficiently clear when a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right" (Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)).

In conclusion, we uphold the district court's denial of Beckworth's motion for summary judgment and find that Miles has alleged sufficient facts to support her claim of First Amendment

gold_text: Beckworth contends that Miles’s First Amendment retaliation claim is not based on clearly established federal law. Prior cases, however, have established that testimony in judicial proceedings are inherently of public concern for First Amendment purposes. Johnston v. Harris Cnty. Flood Control Dist., 869 F.2d 1565, 1578 (5th Cir.1989) (“When an employee testifies before an official government adjudicatory or fact-finding body, he speaks in a context that is inherently of public concern”); Smith v. Hightower, 693 F.2d 359, 368 (5th Cir.1982) (holding that testimony in criminal proceedings is protected speech); Reeves v. Claiborne Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 828 F.2d 1096, 1100 (5th Cir.1987) (holding that testimony in civil proceedings is protected speech). First Amendment protection for Miles’s speech is clearly established.
