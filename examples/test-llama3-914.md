This case involves an appeal from the Court of Military Review, which reversed the decision of the military judge to deny the accused's motion to suppress his confession. The accused claimed that the investigator's pre-rights statement to him was an illegal interrogation under Article 31(b) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), which created a presumptive taint that was not dissipated by subsequent warnings.

The Court of Military Review agreed with the accused's claim, finding that the investigator's pre-advice comments violated Article 31(b) and created a presumptive taint that was not dissipated by subsequent warnings. The court also implied that the investigator's comments might constitute an improper inducement regardless of when they were made.

However, the Supreme Court has held that the doctrine of presumptive taint is not applicable in cases where there is no initial tainting statement and proper advice is provided before the confession. See United States v. Byers, 26 MJ 132 (CMA 1988). Moreover, the Court has also held that an investigator's comments may be considered an improper inducement if they are made before the suspect has been advised of his rights under Article 31. See Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985).

In this case, the investigator's pre-advice comments were made after the accused had been advised of his rights under Article 31. Therefore, the court's reliance on the doctrine of presumptive taint was legal error. Furthermore, the investigator's comments did not constitute an improper inducement because they were made after the accused had been advised of his rights.

In conclusion, the court should not have reversed the military judge's decision to deny the accused's motion to suppress his confession. The accused's confession was voluntary and was not obtained through the use of unlawful coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement.

gold_text: Federal civilian practice does not support a finding of involuntariness simply because a police officer told a suspect in a noncommittal manner that he would call the appropriate authorities’ attention to a suspect’s cooperation with police. See United States v. Alvarado, 882 F.2d 645, 650 (2d Cir.1989), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 1114, 107 L.Ed.2d 1021 (1990); United States v. Leon Guerrero, 847 F.2d 1363, 1367 (9th Cir.1988); United States v. Pelton, 835 F.2d 1067, 1073 (4th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1010, 108 S.Ct. 1741, 100 L.Ed.2d 204 (1988); United States v. Guarno, 819 F.2d 28, 30-31 (2d Cir.1987); Layne v. State, 542 So.2d 237, 240-41 (Miss.1989). However, a specific threat to report a suspect’s failure to cooperate with police to appropriate authorities may render a subsequent confession involuntary in these same courts, assuming it is the motivating factor in the suspect’s decision to speak. Cf. United States v. Crespo de Llano, 838 F.2d 1006, 1015-16 (9th Cir.1987); United States v. Pelton, supra at 1072-73; United States v. Tingle, 658 F.2d 1332, 1336 n.5 (9th Cir.1981). See generally United States v. Spaulding, supra at 161. Consideration of the voluntariness question in light of these decisions as well would be particularly appropriate. See United States v. Johnson, 9 USCMA 591, 26 CMR 371 (1958); cf. United States v. McKay, 9 USCMA 527, 26 CMR 307 (1958).
