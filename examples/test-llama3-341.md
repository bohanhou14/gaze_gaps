The court grants defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that plaintiff failed to pay the full tax assessment prior to commencing this action. The court relies on the precedent set in Flora v. United States, 357 U.S. 63, 78 S.Ct. 1079, 2 L.Ed.2d 1165, aff'd on reh'g, 362 U.S. 145, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960), which held that 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(1) requires a taxpayer to pay the full amount of all assessed tax before he may challenge its correctness by a suit for refund.

The court also considers the IRS Certificate of Assessments and Payments, which reflects the plaintiff's assessments and credits for the 1985 through 1992 tax years. The plaintiff failed to rebut this evidence and did not provide the court with any evidence indicating full payment prior to filing this lawsuit. The court finds that the plaintiff did not pay the full amount of the assessed tax liability for any of the tax years prior to commencing this action, as required by Flora v. United States.

The court also notes that the plaintiff did not file a claim for refund with the IRS for the tax years 1983, 1984, and 1993, as required by 26 U.S.C. § 6511. Therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to hear this case.

The court's decision is based on the precedent set in Flora v. United States and the evidence presented in this case. The court grants defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
