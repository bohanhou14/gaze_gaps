In the case of Edson Flores v. Holder, 388 F.3d 1305, the court held that the detention of an alien pending the completion of removal proceedings and the removal of the alien from the United States is authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and is not a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

The court in Flores v. Holder noted that the INA provides for the detention of aliens who are subject to removal from the United States, and that the detention is authorized by the Attorney General until the alien is removed or until the removal order is rescinded. The court also noted that the INA provides for the release of aliens who are detained pending removal, but only if the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.

In the case of Prieto-Romero v. Gonzales, 534 F.3d 1053, the court held that the detention of an alien who is subject to removal from the United States is authorized by the INA and is not a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The court noted that the INA provides for the detention of aliens who are subject to removal, and that the detention is authorized by the Attorney General until the alien is removed or until the removal order is rescinded.

In the case of Flores v. Holder, the court also noted that the detention of an alien pending the completion of removal proceedings and the removal of the alien from the United States is not a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the alien has not been denied procedural due process. The court noted that the alien has been provided with a bond hearing and has been given the opportunity to present evidence and argue his case.

In conclusion, the detention of an alien pending the completion of removal proceedings and the removal of the alien from the United States is authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act and is not a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The alien has not been denied procedural due process, and the detention is authorized by the Attorney General until the alien is removed or until the removal order is rescinded.

gold_text: In the meantime, petitioner’s continued detention is not in violation of his due process rights as long as his removal is reasonably foreseeable. Significantly, petitioner has provided no evidence that DHS will be unable to remove him within a reasonable time following the resolution of his petition for review. Detention during an appellate stay of removal, whether formal or in accordance with the Second Circuit forbearance policy, is not indefinite because the end of the litigation provides a definite end point. See Prieto-Romero v. Clark, 534 F.3d 1053, 1065 (9th Cir.2008) (alien’s lengthy detention not indefinite under INA § 236 where end point foreseeable with conclusion of litigation); Soberanes v. Comfort, 388 F.3d 1305, 1311 (10th Cir.2004) (alien’s detention during judicial review not indefinite because it has a “definite and evidently impending termination point”). Additionally, there is no institutional barrier to petitioner’s removal to Honduras. In recent years, DHS has successfully repatriated thousands of aliens to Honduras.
