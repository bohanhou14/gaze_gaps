The appellants, Bucky and Tina, argue that the District Court erred by denying their motion for judgment of acquittal and their motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence. They also argue that their indictments should have been dismissed due to the alleged violation of the Jury Selection Act and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution.

In regards to the argument for judgment of acquittal, we find that there was sufficient evidence to support their convictions. The outcome turned on the credibility of the witnesses, and the jury was entitled to believe Gipp's account of the events surrounding his stabbing.

Regarding the newly discovered evidence, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion for new trial. The new evidence, while potentially impeaching Gipp's credibility, would not likely have produced an acquittal.

Finally, we find that the appellants' claims of a violation of the Jury Selection Act and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments must fail. In Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357, 364, 99 S.Ct. 664, 668, 58 L.Ed.2d 579 (1979), the Supreme Court established that a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement can be shown by demonstrating that a distinctive group in the community is underrepresented in the venire. In Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 494, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 1281, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977), the Court held that a group is distinctive if it has a shared attribute that defines or limits its membership and shares a community of interest. The appellants have failed to demonstrate that the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community, or that the representation of this group in the venire is not fair and reasonable.

In conclusion, we affirm the District Court's denial of the appellants' motion for judgment of acquittal and their motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence. We also affirm the District Court's denial of their motion to dismiss their indictments.

Greene, 995 F.2d 793, 796 (8th Cir.1993). In order to establish a violation of the fair cross-section requirement, the defendant must prove: (1) that a distinctive group in the community was excluded; (2) that representation of the group in venires from which juries are selected is unfair and unreasonable in relation to the groupâ€™s numbers in the community; and (3) that the underrepresen-tation is due to systematic exclusion of the group. United States v. Garcia, 991 F.2d 489, 491 (8th Cir.1993). The evidence must demonstrate that exclusion is inherent in the jury-selection procedure used by the court. Ibid.
