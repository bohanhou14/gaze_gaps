Given these circumstances, NIC is prevented from attacking the confirmed plan post-confirmation. Under 11 U.S.C. § 1327(a), a confirmed plan binds both the debtor and all creditors. Courts have consistently upheld the principle that creditors who had notice of the confirmation proceedings but failed to object are bound by the plan's terms. In reference case 213 F.3d 318, it is emphasized that allowing a creditor to attack a confirmed plan would disrupt the finality and balance achieved during the bankruptcy process. Similarly, as observed in 230 F.3d 890, a debtor cannot challenge a confirmed plan collaterally if an objection was not raised before confirmation. 

The Seventh Circuit has made it clear that creditors must assert their rights before confirmation or risk being bound by the plan (984 F.2d 775). The doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, applies to confirmed bankruptcy plans, precluding any post-confirmation disputes that could have been raised earlier (905 F.2d 1107). Therefore, NIC's failure to object timely prohibits its current motion to modify the stay. The motion to modify the stay is thus denied, reinforcing that confirmed plans provide necessary finality and protection for all involved parties.

NIC must now adhere to the terms outlined in the confirmed chapter 13 plan of the debtors, as it is unequivocally bound by it according to existing jurisprudence and statutory guidelines.

gold_text: NIC is bound by the confirmed plan. Under section 1327(a), “[t]he provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan, and whether or not such creditor has objected to, accepted, or has rejected the plan.” 11 U.S.C. § 1327(a). It is therefore well-established “that a party with adequate notice of a bankruptcy proceeding cannot ordinarily attack a confirmed plan.” In re Harvey, 213 F.3d 318, 321 (7th Cir.2000); see also Adair v. Sherman, 230 F.3d 890, 894 (7th Cir.2000) (stating that “once a bankruptcy plan is confirmed, its terms are not subject to collateral attack”); In re Chappell, 984 F.2d 775, 782 (7th Cir.1993); In re Pence, 905 F.2d 1107, 1109-10 (7th Cir.1990).
