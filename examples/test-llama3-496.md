In the context of the legal cases, the issue of ex post facto is crucial in determining the constitutionality of a law. In Reference case 47 M.J. 370, the court held that the automatic total-forfeiture rule and the 14-day provision of Article 57(a)(1) violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Similarly, in Reference case 45 M.J. 567, the court found that the Article 57 amendment does not violate the ex post facto prohibition, as it does not increase the duration of the punishment.

In the case at hand, the issue of ex post facto arises in the context of the recent changes to Articles 57 and 58b of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The appellant argues that he was subject to ex post facto forfeiture of pay by these changes. However, the court cannot grant relief on this ground, as the changes to Articles 57 and 58b do not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.

In Reference case 47 M.J. 771, the court held that the military judge erred in denying the request for an evidentiary hearing to establish the admissibility of an exculpatory polygraph. Similarly, in the present case, the court finds that the military judge should have held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the polygraph examination was sufficiently reliable to present to the members for their consideration.

In conclusion, the court finds that the sentence of dismissal and fine is inappropriately severe for the offenses committed by the appellant. The court grants relief and vacates the sentence. The court also notes that the recent changes to Articles 57 and 58b do not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause and therefore does not grant relief on this ground. <answer>

gold_text: Appellant’s ex post facto arguments were resolved by the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in United States v. Gorsky 47 M.J. 370 (1997). We intend to apply that decision despite appellate government counsel’s argument that we should ignore our superior Court’s opinion and adhere to our decision in United States v. Pedrazoli, 45 M.J. 567 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.1997), which Gorski essentially reversed. See United States v. Plumb, 47 M.J. 771 (A.F.Ct.Crim. App.1997).
