After a thorough examination of the Thomases' claims, we affirm the dismissal of their breach of contract, wrongful attempted foreclosure, FDCPA, and RESPA claims. The Thomases' breach of contract claim fails due to their default on the mortgage payments and failure to cure the default. As per 550 U.S. 544, a plaintiff must show that damages would not have occurred but for the alleged breach, which is not the case here.

The Thomases' wrongful attempted foreclosure claim is also dismissed as it is based on conclusory allegations and lacks factual support. Moreover, the FDCPA claim fails because U.S. Bank and the Rubin law firm do not qualify as "debt collectors" under the statute. As per 556 U.S. 662, a person acquiring a debt after default is only a "debt collector" where that person otherwise meets the statutory definition.

The Thomases' RESPA claim is dismissed for lack of factual allegations indicating that U.S. Bank qualifies as a "servicer" of the Thomases' mortgage and for failure to show that its failure to respond to the February 18, 2014 letter caused cognizable damages. As per 12 U.S.C. § 2605, a loan servicer must respond to a Qualified Written Request within five days, and the Thomases failed to show that U.S. Bank's failure to respond caused them any actual or statutory damages.

In conclusion, we affirm the dismissal of the Thomases' claims against U.S. Bank and the Rubin law firm, as the claims lack merit and fail to meet the legal standards. The Thomases' pro se pleadings were liberally construed, and we recognize that they have a right to seek legal recourse. However, the dismissal is affirmed as the claims do not meet the requirements of the relevant statutes and case law.
