Routt attempts to invoke a broader interpretation of vicarious liability, akin to what the Second Circuit applied for copyright violations. Under the precedent set by Gershwin Publishing Corp. v. Columbia Artists Management, Inc., 443 F.2d 1159, 1162 (2d Cir. 1971), vicarious liability can be established if the defendant has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and a direct financial interest in such activities. However, as established in CAMI, mere financial benefit coupled with some oversight authority does not meet the stringent requirements for vicarious liability in copyright infringement cases (955 F.2d 1143). 

Moreover, similar to the scenario in the Perfect 10 cases, Amazon’s ability to terminate its Associates for non-compliance does not equate to having direct control over their infringing activities (Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 508 F.3d 1146, 1173). Further understanding from the ruling in NLRB v. Donkin’s Inn, 532 F.2d 138, 141 (9th Cir. 1976), suggests that apparent authority must be derived from Amazon’s authoritative actions, not just from provisions in agreements (124 F.3d 1094).

Given these precedents, Routt’s argument fails as she does not demonstrate that Amazon had the necessary control to stop the allegedly infringing conduct immediately, a critical component for establishing vicarious liability in copyright infringement cases.

gold_text: Vicarious liability under the Lan-ham Act requires “a finding that the defendant and the infringer have an apparent or actual partnership, have authority to bind one another in transactions with third parties[J or exercise joint ownership or control over the infringing product.” Visa, 494 F.3d at 807 (quoting Hard Rock Café Licensing Corp. v. Concession Servs., Inc., 955 F.2d 1143, 1150 (7th Cir.1992)). For the same reasons Amazon lacks the ability to supervise its Associates’ conduct, it likewise lacks joint ownership or control over its Associates’ infringing websites. Moreover, Amazon’s operating agreement with its Associates expressly disclaims the existence of any actual partnership and states that neither party shall have the ability to make or accept any offers or representations on the other’s behalf. Routt has not alleged any facts that would establish an apparent partnership or demonstrate that the infringing Associates had apparent authority to bind Amazon. See Unif. P’ship Act § 308 (1997) (“If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented by another as a partner, in a partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the purported partner is liable, to a person to whom the representation is made, if that person, relying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership.”); NLRB v. Dist. Council of Iron Workers, 124 F.3d 1094, 1099 (9th Cir.1997) (“Apparent authority arises from the principal’s manifestátions to a third party that supplies a reasonable basis for that party to believe that the principal has authorized the alleged agent to do the act in question.”). Routt therefore has failed to state a claim for vicarious liability under the Lanham Act.
