The defendants argue that their appeal was timely filed concerning the April 17, 1998 order and thus should be considered within the permissible timeframe. However, drawing on the precedent established in reference cases 724 F.2d 484 and 51 F.3d 42, the appeal must also adhere strictly to procedural requirements.

In 724 F.2d 484, it was emphasized that a new notice of appeal must be filed within the prescribed time following an order disposing of a motion. Campbell’s failure to file a new notice of appeal within thirty days of the district court’s relevant order rendered his subsequent request for an extension under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(5) invalid, as excusable neglect was not demonstrated.

Similarly, in 51 F.3d 42, the district court denied Clark’s motion to extend the appeal time due to the rigid interpretation of "excusable neglect," which almost never encompasses misunderstandings of the rules by counsel. These circumstances underscore that misinterpretations or delays due to counsel’s error rarely constitute sufficient grounds for an extension.

Given these precedents, we find that the defendants' late filing concerning the February 20, 1998, order cannot be justified by the extension granted following the April 17, 1998, order. Both the timing and rationale for the appeal fail to meet the rigorous standards outlined in the referenced cases. Consequently, the appeal regarding sanctions must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, reinforcing the principle that strict compliance with procedural timelines is mandatory.

gold_text: Defendants contend that their Motion for Reconsideration extended the time within which they could appeal the April 17, 1998 Order of Remand. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4), the timely filing of certain post-decision motions defers the start of the appeal period until disposition of the motion. The motions that will extend or toll the thirty-day time limit under Rule 4 include: 1) a motion under Civil Rule 50(b) (insufficient evidence for judgment); 2) a motion under Civil Rule 52(b) (to amend judgment or make additional findings of fact); 3) a motion under Civil Rule 60 (for relief from a judgment); 4) a motion for attorney’s fees by the prevailing party under Civil Rule 54; 5) a motion for new trial under Civil Rule 59(a); and 6) a motion to amend or alter judgment under Civil Rule 59. Defendants argue that we should treat their motion for reconsideration as a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend judgment. We cannot. Defendants’ motion for reconsideration sought only to have the monetary sanctions vacated and “such other and further relief to which Defendant may show themselves justly entitled.” Because the question of sanctions raised in defendants’ motion for reconsideration is collateral to the determination of the merits of the motion to remand, it does not amount to a Rule 59(e) motion triggering Rule 4(a)(4). See Campbell v. Bowlin, 724 F.2d 484, 488 (5th Cir.1984) (overruled on other grounds by United States v. Clark, 51 F.3d 42 (5th Cir.1995)). Therefore, the notice of appeal filed 66 days later did not vest this court with jurisdiction to review the sanction order imposed by the February 20, 1998 order of remand. Further, the notice of appeal is limited by its terms to the $2000.00 sanction order contained in the February 20, 1998 order, and so is not effective in appealing the $2000.00 sanction imposed by the April 17, 1998 order. We conclude that we have no jurisdiction to review the propriety of either sanction order and consequently must dismiss the appeal.
