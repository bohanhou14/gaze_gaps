In the context of tax law, the issue of proving the mailing of a tax return is crucial. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has held that the exceptions to the physical delivery rule available to taxpayers are limited to the two exceptions set out in 26 U.S.C. ยง 7502. Miller v. United States, 784 F.2d 728 (6th Cir.1986). These exceptions are the "mailbox rule" and the registration of mail as prima facie evidence of delivery on the date it was postmarked.

In the case at hand, the debtor's testimony that he timely mailed his tax returns to the IRS is not sufficient to prove the mailing of his tax returns. As the Sixth Circuit has held, courts have consistently rejected testimony or other evidence as proof of the actual date of mailing where the exception of section 7502 is not literally applicable. Deutsch v. Commissioner, 599 F.2d 44 (2nd Cir.1979).

Furthermore, the debtor's reliance on Jones v. United States, 226 F.2d 24 (9th Cir.1955), is misplaced, as that case was decided before the enactment of 26 U.S.C. ยง 7502. The court in that case did not consider the limited exceptions to the physical delivery rule set out in section 7502.

In conclusion, the testimony of the debtor is not sufficient to prove the mailing of his tax returns. The court must rely on the objective evidence of delivery, such as the postmark date or the certification of mailing, to determine whether the tax returns were filed in a timely manner. 909 F.2d 148.
