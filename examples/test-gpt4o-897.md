Petitioners contend that the forgiveness of debts should be seen as a distribution in liquidation without recognizable gain or loss under Section 112(b)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, as laid out in case 173 F.2d 461, the key issue is whether the gain was realized from the debt discharge rather than from the liquidation per se. The debt forgiveness lacked a business purpose and merely served as a means to convert ordinary income to capital gains, which supports the characterization of the forgiveness as a sham transaction. 

The forgiveness of debt did not constitute a distribution in liquidation as defined in Section 112(b)(6), which requires a complete cancellation or redemption of all stock (252 F.2d 693; 47 B.T.A. 213). The forgiveness was merely considered repayment of an obligation, resulting in ordinary income rather than capital gain (58 T.C. 825; Northern Coal & Dock Co., 12 T.C. 42). This interpretation aligns with the broader principles governing liquidating distributions (31 T.C. 891; Bratton v. Commissioner).

Thus, the forgiveness of accrued salaries, bonuses, and interest did not meet the requirements of Section 112(b)(6), and the resultant income from the debt discharge was ordinary income. Respondent's position, deeming the cancellation as inappropriate for tax recognition under these liquidation provisions, is upheld.

In circumstances where the amount distributed is less than the debt obligations of the corporation, so that no amount is available for distribution to the shareholders on account of their stock, it has been held that no liquidating distribution was made, thus rendering the liquidation provisions totally inapplicable. Jorden v. Commissioner, supra at 922; Iron Fireman Manufacturing Co. v. Commissioner, 5 T.C. 452, 462 (1945); Aldrich v. Commissioner, 1 T.C. 602 (1943); Glenmore Distilleries Co. v. Commissioner, 47 B.T.A. 213, 227 (1942); H. G. Hill Stores, Inc. v. Commissioner, supra. Similarly, where, as in the present case, a corporation is indebted to a shareholder-creditor for services rendered or for interest, amounts distributed by the corporation when it liquidates are taxable at ordinary income rates to the extent of the amount of the debt, and the excess is taxable at capital gains rates to the extent it exceeds their basis in the stock.
