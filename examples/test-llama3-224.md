The case presented involves a refinancing operation by a corporation, where it issued bonds with a bonus of common stock. The corporation claims that the bonds were sold at a discount, and therefore, it is entitled to amortize the discount over the life of the bonds. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction, stating that the bonds were sold at par for cash.

The court agrees with the board's finding that the bonds could not be sold at par and that the giving of the stock with the bonds amounted to a bonus that, in effect, was a discount. The court also agrees that the board's finding of the value of the stock, at the time it was given with the sale of the bonds, at $40 per share was supported by substantial evidence.

The court notes that the stock had some value, despite being surrendered by the stockholders to the corporation without cost to the corporation. In giving the stock with the bonds, the corporation sustained a loss, and the court holds that the board was correct in finding that there was an amount which the taxpayer was entitled to amortize over the life of the bonds. The court also cites Helvering, Commissioner, v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 293 U. S. 282, 55 S. Ct. 732, 79 L. Ed. 1343, which states that when the return is made on the accrual basis, expenses or obligations incurred by the taxpayer in connection with a bond issue, which are not discharged until the payment of the bonds at maturity, may properly be accrued or amortized over the period of the life of the bonds and allowed as annual deductions from gross income.

The court concludes that the board's finding of the value of the stock was not clearly erroneous and was based upon substantial evidence. The court also notes that the board's finding is not subject to review by the courts, as it exercises its independent judgment in reaching a conclusion of the character of the one here in question.

In summary, the court holds that the corporation is entitled to amortize the discount over the life of the bonds and that the board's finding of the value of the stock was supported by substantial evidence. The court's decision is based on the principles stated in Helvering, Commissioner, v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 293 U. S. 282, 55 S. Ct. 732, 79 L. Ed. 1343, and the court's inability to
