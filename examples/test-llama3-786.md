In considering an asylum applicant's claim, it is essential to evaluate the credibility of the applicant's testimony. The Board of Immigration Appeals ("BIA") has the authority to make an adverse credibility finding, and we must defer to its determination unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or without a rational basis. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).

In this case, the BIA found that the applicant, Lieke Loho, was not credible and denied her asylum claim. The BIA's finding was based on Loho's voluntary returns to Indonesia after visiting the United States, despite her claims of suffering persecution and having a well-founded fear of future persecution. See 336 F.3d 989.

The BIA's decision was supported by substantial evidence, and we must defer to its credibility findings and uphold the denial of Loho's asylum claim. See 348 F.3d 1153. Loho's voluntary returns to Indonesia undermined her testimony that she experienced past suffering and has a well-founded fear of future persecution.

In contrast to Loho's case, in Kamalthas v. INS, 251 F.3d 1279, 1282-83 (9th Cir.2001), we held that the standards for asylum and relief under the Convention Against Torture are distinct and should not be conflated. However, in this case, Loho's credibility findings were based on her voluntary returns to Indonesia, which were inconsistent with her claims of persecution and fear of persecution.

In conclusion, the BIA's adverse credibility finding in this case was supported by substantial evidence, and we must defer to its determination. Loho's voluntary returns to Indonesia undermined her credibility and supported the denial of her asylum claim. See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, 224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000) ("A failure to satisfy the lower standard of proof required to establish eligibility for asylum therefore necessarily results in a failure to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of deportation.").

gold_text: Because Loho’s asylum claim fails, she necessarily cannot satisfy the more stringent standard of proof required to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. See Farah v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Moreover, in light of the IJ’s adverse credibility finding, we are satisfied that substantial evidence supports denial of Loho’s claim under CAT. See Malhi v. INS, 336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that relief under CAT requires a showing that “it is ‘more likely than not’ that [the petitioner] will be tortured if returned to [his native land]” (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2))); see also Farah, 348 F.3d at 1157 (noting that “[the petitioner’s] claims under the Convention Against Torture are based on the same statements ... that the BIA determined to be not credible”).
