As we can see from the case, the plaintiff, Pamela Vadeboncoeur, seeks judicial review of the Commissioner's decision denying her application for Disability Insurance Benefits and Supplemental Security Income. The case involves a review of the Administrative Law Judge's (ALJ) decision, which found that the plaintiff was not disabled despite her numerous medical conditions.

The ALJ's decision is supported by substantial evidence, as required by law. The ALJ considered the plaintiff's testimony, medical records, and the vocational expert's testimony. The vocational expert testified that the plaintiff could perform sedentary work and could perform her past relevant work as a product hand assembler.

In determining whether the plaintiff could perform her past relevant work, the ALJ relied on the testimony of the vocational expert. The vocational expert stated that the plaintiff could return to her past work as a production assembler and that there would be a variety of hand-assembly positions that she could perform in the national economy. This testimony was unobjected to and the plaintiff's attorney did not cross-examine the vocational expert on this point.

The plaintiff argues that the ALJ's decision is not supported by substantial evidence, but this argument is unfounded. The ALJ's decision is supported by the vocational expert's testimony and the medical records, which show that the plaintiff is capable of performing sedentary work.

In addition, the plaintiff submitted new evidence to the Appeals Council, which was denied. The new evidence includes medical records from the plaintiff's hospitalizations for hernia repair. However, this evidence does not provide a basis for changing the ALJ's decision, as it only confirms the ALJ's statement of the plaintiff's condition and does not show that the plaintiff's RFC has changed.

In conclusion, the Commissioner's decision is affirmed, and the plaintiff's motion for remand is denied. The ALJ's decision is supported by substantial evidence, and the new evidence submitted by the plaintiff does not provide a basis for changing the decision.
