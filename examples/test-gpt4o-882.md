In assessing whether McGee's prior conviction under Iowa Code Sections 708.1 and 708.2(3) qualifies as a "crime of violence," we consider precedent from the Eighth Circuit. In United States v. Maid, 772 F.3d 1118 (8th Cir. 2014), the court concluded that "Assault While Displaying a Dangerous Weapon" under Iowa Code §§ 708.1(3) and 708.2(3) categorically qualifies as a crime of violence under USSG § 4B1.2(a)(1), as both "intentionally pointing any firearm toward another" and "displaying in a threatening manner any dangerous weapon toward another" constitute a "threatened use of physical force" (id. at 1120-21). Similarly, in United States v. Boots, 816 F.3d 971 (8th Cir. 2016), the court reaffirmed that a conviction under these Iowa statutes qualifies as a crime of violence, thereby justifying an enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) (id. at 975).

Applying this reasoning, McGee's conviction aligns with the court's rationale in Maid and Boots, confirming the district court's decision to enhance McGee's base offense level to 22 was appropriate. Therefore, the district court did not err in categorizing McGee's prior assault conviction as a violent felony under the force clause of U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)(1).

Boots, 816 F.3d 971 (8th Cir. 2016), we held that convictions for Assault While Displaying a Dangerous Weapon under Iowa Code §§ 708.1 & 708.2(3) "categorically qualified as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)(1)." 816 F.3d at 974. We explained that intentionally pointing a firearm at another person and displaying a dangerous weapon toward another in a threatening manner constitute, categorically, "a 'threatened use of physical force' under USSG § 4B1.2(a)(1)." Maid, 772 F.3d at 1121.
