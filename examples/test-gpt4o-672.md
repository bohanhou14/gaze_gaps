In Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60, the U.S. Supreme Court held that ordinances denying property rights based on race were unconstitutional as they violated the Fourteenth Amendment. This precedent was reinforced in Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U.S. 668, and Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, wherein the Court invalidated similar ordinances. Specifically, in Shelley v. Kraemer, the Court declared that state enforcement of racially restrictive covenants in property deeds was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Additionally, as stated in the Court's opinion, "The Fourteenth Amendment...entitles a colored man to acquire property without state legislation discriminating against him solely because of color" (68 S. Ct. 836).

The ordinances from the City of Birmingham, which prohibited Negroes from occupying residential properties in white-zoned areas, mirror the restrictive measures invalidated in these landmark decisions. Therefore, based on these established precedents, the zoning laws and supplementary ordinance No. 709-F of Birmingham are unconstitutional.

Given these authoritative decisions, the trial court's judgment that the Birmingham ordinances are unconstitutional and void as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment is firmly supported by the cited cases such as Buchanan, Harmon, and Shelley. Consequently, appellants' claims that these ordinances constitute a legitimate exercise of police power cannot withstand judicial scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment protections outlined in the aforementioned cases.

gold_text: In Buchanan v. Warley, supra, the Supreme Court in considering an ordinance of the City of Louisville, Which it held to be unconstitutional, said that Colored persons have the right to- purchase property and enjoy and use the same without laws discriminating against them solely on account of color. In an effort to avoid the impact of this decision appellants insist that the Buchanan case involved the right to dispose of property and not, as in the case at bar, the right of occupancy. The Supreme Court of Louisiana, in considering an ordinance of the City of New Orleans in the case of Tyler v. Harmon, 158 La. 439, 104 So. 200, 205, also attempted to' distinguish the Buchanan case on the same ground and found that the underlying reasons which prompted the Supreme Court to hold the ordinance of the City of Louisville unconstitutional were not pertinent to the ordinance of the City of New Orleans because there was nothing in the New Orleans ordinance forbidding “a white man to sell his property to a colored man, or forbidding a colored man to sell to a white man” in any community or neighborhood. On that basis, the Supreme Court of Louisiana held the ordinance of the City of New Orleans valid in so far as it forbad Negro tenants to occupy defendant’s cottages in a white community. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed, finding the citation of Buchanan v. Warley, supra, sufficient to support -its judgment. Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U.S. 668, 47 S.Ct. 471, 71 L.Ed. 831. The principle established in these cases was thereafter followed in City of Richmond v. Dean, 4 Cir., 37 F.2d 712; affirmed 281 U.S. 704, 50 S.Ct. 407, 74 L.Ed. 1128. And in the recent case of Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 11, 68 S. Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161, the Supreme Court in considering restrictions on the right of occupancy which had been created by private agreements again stated that legislation imposing restrictions on the right of occupancy solely because of color cannot be squared with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.
