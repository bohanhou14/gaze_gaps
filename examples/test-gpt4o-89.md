The principle at issue is whether WL Homes had sufficient rights in the JLH account to pledge it as collateral for the Wachovia loan. Under California law, consent from the collateral's owner can provide such rights. This is akin to the ruling in 208 B.R. 232, where corporate consent to use assets as collateral was inferred through the corporate officers’ actions. Here, JLH’s consent can be imputed based on the knowledge and actions of Wayne Stelmar, the president of JLH and CFO of WL Homes. His dual roles ensure that WL Homes had sufficient rights in the JLH account, thus validating Wachovia’s security interest (208 B.R. 232).

Additionally, the Bankruptcy Court’s use-and-control theory finds support in 618 F.2d 432, where control and use of assets by the debtor were deemed sufficient to establish security interest. Similarly, WL Homes's control over the JLH account complements the consent theory, giving Wachovia rights to enforce its interest in the account.

Therefore, both theories — consent and use/control — provide a valid basis for Wachovia's security interest in the JLH account. As such, we affirm the District Court's ruling.

IV.

In conclusion, we find that WL Homes had sufficient rights in the JLH account through both the consent of JLH and its control over the account to grant Wachovia a valid security interest. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court, relying on the principles established in 618 F.2d 432, 208 B.R. 232, and relevant state law.

gold_text: In Matter of Pubs, Inc. of Champaign, 618 F.2d 432, 435-38 (7th Cir.1980), the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit considered a situation in which two individuals who were also the officers of the debtor corporation promised their own equipment as collateral for a loan from the bank. The debtor corporation later filed for bankruptcy and the court held that the individuals had properly pledged the collateral and concluded that “[njotice to the director of a corporation is notice to the corporation and estops the corporation and its receiver from questioning the validity of a prior transaction.” Id. at 438. In Atchison, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, applying the Uniform Commercial Code, likewise held that the signature of the person who owned the collateral individually but pledged it on behalf of his corporation had manifested his consent to granting a security interest in the property. 832 F.2d at 1239-40 (“[E]ven if he did own the equipment, his signature for A & W was sufficient to infer his consent to its use as collateral.”). A United States Bankruptcy Court has applied Atchison to facts similar to those presented here — to a situation in which the individuals who owned the property pledged as security (a coin collection) signed the security agreement in his capacity as a corporate officer. In re 4-R Management, Inc., 208 B.R. 232, 237 (Bankr.N.D.Ala.1997). The court held that the owners’ individual signatures on the security agreement “was sufficient to infer corporate consent to use the coins as collateral.” Id. at 238.
