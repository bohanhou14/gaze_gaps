We review a district court's denial of a Rule 56(f) motion for abuse of discretion, applying the standard set forth in Wallin v. Norman, 317 F.3d 558, 564 (6th Cir.2003). In this case, Hickman requested additional discovery to determine the timing and location of Hickman's body when shot, as well as to depose a county official related to the administrative investigation and handling of excessive force complaints. In denying the motions, the district court found that the discovery sought was not relevant to the issues on appeal and that the motions were moot in light of its summary judgment ruling. We agree with the district court's assessment, as Hickman's motions were based on a misunderstanding of the record and did not present a genuine issue of material fact. Furthermore, the district court's denial of the motions did not constitute an abuse of discretion, as it was reasonable in light of the circumstances. Reference case 404 F.3d 418 supports this conclusion, as it holds that a district court may deny a Rule 56(f) motion if the discovery sought is not relevant to the issues on appeal. Therefore, we affirm the district court's denial of Hickman's motions for further discovery. Reference cases 538 F.3d 448 and 368 F.3d 881 also support this conclusion, as they demonstrate the deference afforded to a district court's

An abuse of discretion occurs when a district court “commits a clear error of judgment, such as applying the incorrect legal standard, misapplying the correct legal standard, or relying upon clearly erroneous findings of fact.” Info-Hold, Inc. v. Sound Merch., Inc., 538 F.3d 448, 454 (6th Cir.2008). To prevail on a Rule 56(f) motion, the plaintiff must “state with some precision the materials he hopes to obtain with further discovery, and exactly how he expects those materials would help him in opposing summary judgment.” Summers v. Leis, 368 F.3d 881, 887 (6th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). We typically will find that a district court has abused its discretion in denying such a motion if the court does so when no discovery has occurred. See CenTra, Inc. v. Estrin, 538 F.3d 402, 420-21 (6th Cir.2008); McKinley, 404 F.3d at 443.
