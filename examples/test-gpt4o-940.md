In resolving the contention regarding the combined trial and the potential prejudice resulting from the admission of statements by Dillon, we refer to established precedents ensuring the jury is presumed to follow judicial instructions. As emphasized in Opper v. United States, 348 U.S. 84, 95, and reaffirmed in the case at 352 U.S. 232, the theory of our trial system relies on the ability of the jury to follow clear instructions provided by the trial court. Here, the trial judge provided explicit admonitions to the jury, instructing them to consider Dillon’s statements solely in determining his guilt and not that of Endicott, Bartello, or Duggar.

There is no indication from the record that the jury disregarded these instructions, nor is there evidence of substantial prejudice against the appellants due to the joint trial. Given these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court did not err in its judgment. The joint trial under the given instructions does not amount to reversible error, aligning with the precedents set in the aforementioned cases.

gold_text: It is interesting to note that each judge except two in this circuit has written on the rule announced in Opper v. United States, 348 U.S. 84, 95, 75 S.Ct. 158, 99 L.Ed. 101 (1954). Each case holds that the trial court’s discretion is broad and its action will be upheld in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion. We find no clear abuse of discretion here. The cautionary instruction cured what might otherwise have been resulting prejudice. “We may * * * fairly proceed on the basis that the jury followed these instructions.” Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 232, 241, 77 S.Ct. 294, 299, 1 L.Ed.2d 278 (1957).
