In the context of a liberty interest, the Supreme Court has recognized a liberty interest "where a person's good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him." Roth, 408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. 2701. This interest is implicated when a government action "stigmatizes" an individual, causing a "stigma or other disability that would foreclose his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities." Id. at 573-74, 92 S.Ct. 2701.

In the case at hand, the plaintiffs argue that the defendant's statements about their alleged absenteeism stigmatized them and deprived them of their liberty interest. However, the district court correctly held that the statements did not rise to the level of a stigmatizing action that would implicate a liberty interest. Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 701, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976).

Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not provide any evidence that the defendant's statements were made in conjunction with their termination, which is a requirement for a liberty interest to be implicated. Chilingirian v. Boris, 882 F.2d 200, 205-06 (6th Cir.1989). Additionally, the plaintiffs did not demonstrate that the defendant's statements were made with the intent to stigmatize them, which is also necessary for a liberty interest to be implicated. Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991).

In conclusion, the plaintiffs' claim of deprivation of liberty interest lacks merit. The defendant's statements did not stigmatize the plaintiffs, and they did not demonstrate a liberty interest. The district court's decision to grant judgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendant is therefore affirmed.

gold_text: In order to establish a deprivation of a liberty interest in one’s reputation, a plaintiff must satisfy five elements- : (l)The stigmatizing statements must be made in conjunction with the plaintiffs termination from employment. Ludwig v. Bd. of Trustees of Ferris State Univ., 123 F.3d 404, 410 (6th Cir.1997).(2) The statements must be more than mere allegations of improper or inadequate performance, incompetence, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. Id. The statements must be “so charged with a moral stigma such as immorality or dishonesty” that they foreclose the plaintiff from seeking alternate employment. Baar v. Jefferson Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 311 Fed.Appx. 817, 826 (6th Cir.2009) (quoting Ludwig, 123 F.3d at 410). See also Martin v. City of Glasgow, 882 F.Supp.2d 903, 914 (W.D.Ky.2012) (finding there was no violation of a protected-liberty interest because police department press release did not “bear[] upon the [plaintiffs] immorality or dishonesty).” “A charge that merely makes a plaintiff less attractive to other employers but leaves open a definite range of opportunity does not constitute a liberty deprivation.” Chilingirian v. Boris, 882 F.2d 200, 205 n. 8 (6th Cir.1989).(3) The statements must be made public. Ludwig, 123 F.3d at 410.(4) The plaintiff must claim that the charges made against him were false. Id. Finally, (5) the public dissemination must have been voluntary. Id.
