**Generation:**

Phillips relies heavily on the doctrine of interference estoppel, arguing that Exxon is precluded from claiming the substituted metallocene catalysts due to its procedural inaction during the interference. This doctrine, as discussed in **Reference Case 803 F.2d 705**, emphasizes the necessity for a party to timely raise all relevant claims during the interference proceedings or face estoppel. The court in Kroekel ruled that because Kroekel did not address the patentability of other claims outside of claim 40 during the interference, he was estopped from pursuing them later.

Similarly, in **Reference Case 977 F.2d 1449**, the Board determined that Deckler suppressed his invention, thereby losing priority to Grataloup. Thus, Deckler could not later pursue claims that were patentably indistinguishable from the interference count. Here, however, Phillips' argument fails because Exxon was never without claims during the relevant proceedings, thus maintaining the chain of copendency required for claiming the substituted metallocene catalysts.

The district court correctly ruled that interference estoppel does not apply outside of PTO procedures to invalidate an issued patent. The procedural nuances in Exxon's case align more closely with those outlined in **977 F.2d 1449**, where patentably indistinguishable claims were barred, but here Exxon’s claims to substituted catalysts are distinct and separately evaluated. Consequently, Phillips' procedural error argument does not stand, and the interference estoppel defense is inapplicable.

gold_text: The district court observed that no court has recognized this ground of patent invalidity. Assuming that an irregularity occurred (although its nature is not clear to us) the district court ruled that a procedural lapse in an interference proceeding does not affect whether the claims are valid or enforceable under the laws of validity and enforceability. No court has held otherwise. See, e.g., Exxon Corp. v. Mobil Oil, No. H-96-3795 (S.D.Tex. Aug. 12, 1998) (holding that interference estop-pel is not a valid defense); Baxter Int’l Inc. v. Cobe Lab., Inc., No. 89 C 9460, 1991 WL 288828 (N.D.Ill. Dec. 26, 1991) (denying motion for summary judgment on interference estoppel issue due to genuine issues of material fact), recons, denied, 1992 WL 151894 (N.D.Ill. June 15, 1992); Chemetron Corp. v. Airco, Inc., 198 USPQ 119, 125-26, 1976 WL 21030 (N.D.Ill.1976) (questioning applicability of interference estoppel as invalidity defense). The two cases that Phillips cites in support of its argument, In re Deckler, 977 F.2d 1449, 24 USPQ2d 1448 (Fed.Cir.1992) and In re Kroekel, 803 F.2d 705, 231 USPQ 640 (Fed.Cir.1986), relate to prosecution within the PTO, not to the validity of an issued patent claiming subject matter found to be patentable. Neither Kroekel nor Deckler holds that a possibly imperfect interference procedure is a defense in an infringement action, whether the imperfection was due to the examiner, the applicant, or both.
