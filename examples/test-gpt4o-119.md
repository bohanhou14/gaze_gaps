In his appeal, Niland asserts that the erroneous jury instructions violated his federal constitutional rights, invoking a misapplication of clearly established law as articulated in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), Niland contends that the state court’s decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.

In reference to the erroneous jury instructions on malice, the court's assessment aligns with the precedent set by 521 U.S. 320, which emphasizes that procedural defaults are substantive grounds that must be considerably weighted. The district court, following the guidance of 529 U.S. 362, emphasized that state courts must ensure uniform interpretations of federal law to prevent geographical discrepancies in the application of justice. Therefore, applying the reasoning in these cases, the district court's scrutiny of the jury instructions did not reveal a fundamental unfairness that compromised the trial's integrity.

Furthermore, Niland's claim regarding consciousness of guilt instructions mirrors concerns articulated in 529 U.S. 362 about the necessary uniformity in federal law interpretations. The district court concluded that the provided instructions did not improperly shift the burden of proof, adhering to the due process requirements delineated by the Supreme Court.

Thus, we find no constitutional error in the district court's analysis and affirm its dismissal of Niland’s habeas petition.
