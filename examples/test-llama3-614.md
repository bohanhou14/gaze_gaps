The case at hand raises important questions regarding the primary jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission (FPC) in regulating natural gas transportation and the application of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The appellees, a natural gas pipeline company, refused to transport natural gas belonging to the appellant, citing a contract that obligated other parties to purchase most of the pipeline capacity.

The trial court correctly held that the appellant was required to first seek relief from the FPC before bringing an action in the District Court. This is in line with the principle of primary administrative jurisdiction established in cases such as Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co. (204 U.S. 426, 27 S.Ct. 350, 51 L.Ed. 553) and Michigan Consol. Gas Co. v. Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co. (173 F.2d 784).

The appellees argue that they did not have a schedule of rates on file with the FPC, which is a requirement under the Natural Gas Act. However, the amended complaint references a contract that was approved by the FPC, which discloses the rates and terms of transportation. This contract, along with other documents, reveals that the appellees did have a schedule of rates on file with the FPC.

The appellant argues that it would be futile to attempt to invoke the aid of the FPC because the appellees refuse to transport its gas. However, the Commission has the authority to require the appellees to file a tariff and can investigate and remedy any unfair or discriminatory practices.

In conclusion, the trial court correctly held that the appellant was required to first seek relief from the FPC before bringing an action in the District Court. The appellees did have a schedule of rates on file with the FPC, and the Commission has the authority to investigate and remedy any unfair or discriminatory practices.

gold_text: Appellant’s alleged cause of action based on the refusal of appellee to transport its gas is, in effect, a collateral attack upon an order of the Commission. Appellant’s real grievance concerns the contract made by appellees for carrying gas through their pipeline. We may take judicial notice of records and reports of administrative bodies. Greeson v. Imperial Irr. Dist., 9 Cir., 1932, 59 F.2d 529; Fletcher v. Jones, D.C. Cir.1939, 105 F.2d 58, certiorari denied 308 U.S. 555, 60 S.Ct. 116, 84 L.Ed. 467. In doing so we observe that the construction of the pipeline here involved was based upon a thirty-year contract whereby appellees obligated themselves to carry not only a minimum load factor of 91% of the pipeline’s capacity, but for its entire use if necessary. In re El Paso Natural Gas Co., 1946, 5 Federal Power Commission Reports 115. The Commission, after a public hearing, issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the pipeline upon the terms of which appellant complains. Appellees are bound to conform to the provisions of that contract unless relieved by the Commission. 15 U.S.C.A. § 717c (d). They could not carry appellant’s gas without violating their contract and the certificate of public convenience and necessity. The combination and conspiracy in restraint of trade, alleged in the amended complaint, is no more than criticism of appellees for conforming with the contract on file and approved by the Commission. Appellant cannot, by means of this suit for damages, indirectly annul the action taken by the Commission. Edward Chappell Co. v. Chesapeake & O. R. Co., D.C.N.Y. 1952, 110 F.Supp. 46, affirmed 2 Cir., 1953, 202 F.2d 149; Watab Paper Company v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 8 Cir., 1946, 154 F.2d 436.
