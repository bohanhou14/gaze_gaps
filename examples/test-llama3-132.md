We cannot conclude that the Board erred in affirming the OPM's decision, as the Board applied the correct legal standard and the evidence of record did not support Metz's claim. The Board's decision is consistent with the precedent set forth in 244 F.3d 1337, which states that the presumption of regularity applies to the mailing of a notice of appeal rights. Similarly, the Board's decision is consistent with the precedent set forth in 244 F.3d 1337, which states that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims did not err by applying the presumption of regularity to the mailing of a copy of a notice of appeal rights.

In the present case, the Board applied the correct legal standard and the evidence of record did not support Metz's claim. The Board's decision is consistent with the precedent set forth in 272 U.S. 1, which states that the President will be presumed to have known the material facts and to have acted in the light of them. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the Board erred in affirming the OPM's decision.

In conclusion, we affirm the Board's decision and hold that the OPM's denial of Metz's claim for disability retirement benefits under the CSRS is supported by the evidence of record and is consistent with the applicable legal standards. We cannot conclude that the Board erred in affirming the OPM's decision, as the Board applied the correct legal standard and the evidence of record did not support Metz's claim.

gold_text: Metz has not demonstrated “a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.” Lindahl, 470 U.S. at 791. First, the record reflects receipt of Metz’s coworkers’ affidavits by the AJ. We presume that the AJ reviewed that evidence, as she stated that she considered all the evidence of record. See Butler v. Principi, 244 F.3d 1337, 1340 (Fed.Cir.2001) (absent evidence to the contrary, public officials are presumed to have properly discharged their official duties) (citing United States v. Chem. Found., Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14-15, 47 S.Ct. 1, 71 L.Ed. 131 (1926)). Moreover, Metz has not produced evidence that the affidavits were not considered, except the inference by silence, which is insufficient. The failure of the AJ to specifically mention those affidavits in her opinion does not mean that they were not considered. Secondly, Metz’s contention that the Board’s disability decision was not focused on his case has no merit. The AJ carefully considered Metz’s particular medical evidence, including physician reports. See Metz I at 9-11. As explained above, we are not free to review the AJ’s factual determinations; we can only ensure that the administrative process was not irregular, and we affirm the Board’s decision because it was not.
