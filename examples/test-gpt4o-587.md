**Generation:**

Crawley contends that the restitution order improperly extends beyond the temporal scope of the indictment. He draws support from **United States v. Inman** (Reference case 411 F.3d 591), where it was determined that a restitution order should not exceed the temporal scope of the conduct charged. In that case, the court underscored that restitution under the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MVRA) should only cover conduct clearly delineated in the indictment.

Further, the **United States v. Wright** (Reference case 496 F.3d 371) elucidates that the court must pay heed to the specific time frame referenced in the indictment when calculating restitution. Wright argues that restitution should not encompass losses beyond the timeframe specified in the indictment. Here, because Crawley's indictment was aimed at specific periods of fraud, extending restitution beyond these periods would contradict the ruling in **Wright**, which reaffirmed that "restitution for the underlying scheme to defraud is limited to the specific temporal scope of the indictment."

Thus, Crawley’s argument merits consideration that restitution should be confined to the timeframe explicitly stated in the indictment, and any extension beyond should be deemed as error.

gold_text: Crawley contests the restitution of $121,478.86 (salary and pension from 2003 and the $20,000 kickback) because he claims that amount was not actually lost by Local 988. Under the Mandatory Victim Restoration Act (MVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, “[a] defendant ... is only responsible for paying restitution for the conduct underlying the offense for which he was convicted”. United States v. Wright, 496 F.3d 371, 381-82 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Inman, 411 F.3d 591, 595 (5th Cir.2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). When, as here, a fraudulent scheme is an element of the conviction, the court may award restitution for “actions pursuant to that scheme”, with the restitution for the underlying scheme to defraud being limited to the specific temporal scope of the indictment.
