ORDER GRANTING FEDERAL COUNTER-DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS and GRANTING LEAVE TO FILE AN AMENDED COUNTERCLAIM

In this case, the Court considered the City's motion to dismiss the Counterclaim, filed by the Federal Counter-Defendants. The City argued that the Counterclaim should be dismissed due to procedural bars, including res judicata, sovereign immunity, and failure to state a claim.

The Court held that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply, citing Wilson v. County of Orange, 881 So.2d 625 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004). The Court also held that the City's sovereign immunity does not extend to constitutional violations, citing Trianon Park Condominium Ass'n, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 468 So.2d 912, 918-920 (Fla.1985).

Regarding the City's argument that the Counterclaim fails to state a claim, the Court held that the Counterclaim adequately alleges constitutional claims, including claims for violations of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court also held that the Counterclaim adequately alleges a claim for regulatory takings under the Fifth Amendment, citing City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 721, 119 S.Ct. 1624, 143 L.Ed.2d 882 (1999).

The Court also held that the Counterclaim adequately alleges a claim for procedural due process, citing Doe v. Florida Bar, 630 F.3d 1336 (11th Cir.2011).

Therefore, the Court granted the Federal Counter-Defendants' motion to dismiss and granted leave to file an amended counterclaim.

gold_text: The notice necessary “to satisfy due process requires only that interested persons be given ‘notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.’ ” Mesa Valder rama v. U.S., 417 F.3d 1189, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)). Counter-Plaintiffs argue that they have been denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard, with defective notices under state law and the threat of arrest compounding the procedural due process violations. On a motion to dismiss, the Court must take the factual allegations regarding the allegedly deficient notices as true. See Amended Counterclaim, ¶¶ 49, 51, 52, 55. Though as plead, the present claim is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, after discovery, it will be up to the Court to determine as a legal matter whether the notice was constitutionally sufficient, a decision that cannot be made in this case solely upon the present pleadings.
