This stringent interpretation contrasts sharply with the intent of the 1963 amendments to Rule 25 and Rule 6(b), which aimed to inject flexibility and fairness into the substitution process. As noted in 379 F.2d 94 and 359 F.2d 292, the amendments were designed to eliminate the inequities and hardships caused by the rigid two-year limitation originally imposed. The Advisory Committee emphasized that the revised rules were to be liberally construed to allow courts discretion in extending the substitution period, recognizing the difficulties that could arise in promptly identifying and notifying the proper representative of the deceased. 

Given this context, the defendant’s counsel's suggestion of death, which lacked identification of a proper representative, failed to initiate the 90-day countdown. This interpretation aligns with the judicial precedent that courts should prioritize the equitable administration of justice over strict procedural formalities. Thus, the district court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs' action without granting the requested extension, especially considering the circumstances that inhibited timely substitution, such as the injury to plaintiffs' counsel and the ongoing legal processes in the probate court.

We, therefore, reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, ensuring that the substitution process adheres to the flexible and just principles intended by the amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
