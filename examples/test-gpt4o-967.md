This court’s determination aligns with the binding precedent within the Eleventh Circuit, affirming that the Alabama tort of bad faith refusal to pay is preempted by ERISA. As noted in reference case 279 F.3d 1289, the satisfaction of ERISA’s preemption criteria is paramount, and the common law action asserted here “relates to” an employee benefit plan. This conclusion is reinforced by pre-established cases within our circuit, such as Butero v. Royal Maccabees Life Ins. Co., 174 F.3d 1207, 1215 (11th Cir. 1999), which decisively held that ERISA preempts such state law tort claims (279 F.3d 1289). 

Further adherence to precedents like Amos v. Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Ala., 868 F.2d 430 (11th Cir.1989) and Belasco v. W.K.P. Wilson & Sons, Inc., 833 F.2d 277 (11th Cir.1987) leave no room for deviation; these cases uniformly establish the non-applicability of the state law saving clause under ERISA preemption (276 F.3d 1292).

Thus, in accordance with these precedents and the doctrine of complete preemption under ERISA, the court finds it apt to deny the Motion To Remand and retain the case within federal jurisdiction.

We have held on more than one occasion, in precedent binding on this Circuit that the saving clause does not apply to this tort.” Gilbert v. Alta Health & Life Ins. Co., 276 F.3d 1292, 1299 (11th Cir.2001). See also, Walker v. S. Co. Servs. Inc., 279 F.3d 1289, 1294 (11th Cir.2002); Butero v. Royal Maccabees Life Ins. Co., 174 F.3d 1207, 1215 (11th Cir.1999); Amos v. Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Ala., 868 F.2d 430 (11th Cir.1989); Belasco v. W.K.P. Wilson & Sons, Inc., 833 F.2d 277, 281 (11th Cir.1987). Consequently, bad faith tort claims are also preempted by ERISA.
