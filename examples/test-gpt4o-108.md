E. Amended Procedure Orders

Shekoyan challenges two unpublished district court orders regarding his attempt to submit non-standard affidavits in opposition to Sibley’s motion for summary judgment. The district court’s authority to deny leave to amend under Rule 15(a) is well-established, and we review such decisions for abuse of discretion (73 F.3d 418). For example, in Firestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1209 (D.C.Cir.1996), the court emphasized that leave to amend is "almost always" allowed to cure deficiencies in pleading fraud. However, undue prejudice to the opposing party could justify denial (73 F.3d 418).

Similarly, the Supreme Court in Browning-Ferris Industries v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257 (1989), underscored the importance of adhering to procedural norms. In this case, the district court struck the unnotarized affidavit and unsigned declaration, considering them non-compliant with established procedures (496 U.S. 384).

We find that the district court acted within its discretion, ensuring compliance with Rule 15(a) and relevant case precedents. Therefore, the procedural orders in question stand affirmed.

gold_text: Shekoyan also contests two procedural orders issued by the district court during the course of the litigation. The first is the district court’s refusal to permit Shekoyan to file a motion for summary judgment after the deadline for filing dis-positive motions. Order, Case No. 00-2519 (February 3, 2004) (summary judgment order). The second is the district court’s denial of Shekoyan’s motion for Rule 11 sanctions against Sibley’s lawyers. Order, Case No. 00-2519 (February 17, 2004) (Rule 11 Order). We review both orders for abuse of discretion. See Atchinson v. District of Columbia, 73 F.3d 418, 424 (D.C.Cir.1996) (reviewing denial of motion to amend complaint for abuse of discretion); Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990) (“[A]n appellate court should apply an abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of a district court’s Rule 11 determination.”). In the Rule 11 context, we note that a district court “would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” Id.
