Qualified immunity shields government officials from civil liability when their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. As established in reference case 66 F.3d 416, summary judgment on orders denying qualified immunity is appropriate where the defense is established as a matter of law or fundamental error in applying the law is committed.

The defendants claim qualified immunity on the grounds that their decision to deny the permit was objectively reasonable. According to 105 F.3d 106, if the law was unclear at the time of the defendants’ actions regarding the specific constitutional right, it was reasonable for the defendants to act as they did. Moreover, reasonable officials could disagree on whether such laws were violated, reinforcing the defense of qualified immunity.

Furthermore, as clarified in 93 F.3d 86, an appeal is permissible where the defendants accept the plaintiff's allegations as true for the purpose of the appeal and yet assert that their conduct met the standard of objective legal reasonableness as established by Harlow v. Fitzgerald.

Thus, the defendants in this case are entitled to qualified immunity because their actions did not contravene clearly established legal principles, and reasonable officials could certainly differ in their interpretation and application of the relevant legal provisions at the time of their actions. Accordingly, the Court grants the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.

gold_text: The defendants further move for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. Government actors who perform discretionary functions are protected from liability for civil damages where their conduct does not' violate a clearly established constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known. Doe v. Marsh, 105 F.3d 106, 109 (2d Cir.1997); Salim v. Proulx, 93 F.3d 86, 89 (2d Cir.1996); Lennon v. Miller, 66 F.3d 416, 420 (2d Cir.1995). Even where the plaintiffs rights and the scope of the officials’ permissible conduct are clearly established, the qualified immunity defense protects a governmental actor if it was “objectively reasonable” for the actor to believe that his actions were lawful at the time of the alleged unlawful conduct. Marsh, 105 F.3d at 109-10; Lennon, 66 F.3d at 420.
