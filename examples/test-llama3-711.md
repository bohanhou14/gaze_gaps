In light of the legal precedents, it is clear that the defendants' actions constitute unfair competition. The doctrine of equitable interference is well-established in cases such as Pillsbury-Washburn Flour-Mills Co. v. Eagle, 30 C. C. A. 386, 86 Fed. 608, and Gage-Downs Co. v. Featherbone Corset Co. (C. C.) 83 Fed. 213. These cases demonstrate that a trade name can be adopted as a trademark, and that unfair competition can occur when a party misrepresents the source or quality of a product.

The defendants' sale of professional "Satin-Set" hair spray without warning of its allegedly undesirable effect when used by untrained persons is likely to deceive the public and constitutes a misrepresentation. As the court held in Champion Spark Plug Corp. v. Sanders, 331 U.S. 125, 67 S.Ct. 1136, 91 L.Ed. 1386, a similar situation involving the reconditioning of used spark plugs, the kind of merchandising employed might enable dealers to "palm off" defendants' plugs as new ones and thus to mislead the public.

Furthermore, the defendants' actions are likely to cause injury to plaintiff's good will and reputation. As the court held in Carbonated Beverages, Inc. v. Wisko, 297 Mich. 80, 297 N.W. 79, actual deception of any member of the buying public is not necessary to establish unfair competition, it being sufficient if it appears that deception will be the natural and probable consequence of defendants' acts.

In conclusion, the defendants' actions constitute unfair competition and are likely to deceive the public, causing injury to plaintiff's good will and reputation. The court has a duty to grant injunctive relief to prevent such harm. See 220 Bagley Corp. v. Julius Freud Land Co., 317 Mich. 470, 27 N.W.2d 59.

gold_text: The defendants have relied on a host of cases to sustain their position that the plaintiff must show actual public deception and specific loss of trade in order to be entitled to injunctive relief, but this Court concludes that none of these decisions govern the instant case and that only the cases of United-Detroit Theaters Corp. v. Colonial Theatrical Enterprise, Inc., 280 Mich. 425, 273 N. W. 756; American Washboard Co. v. Saginaw Mfg. Co. (C.C.A.6), 103 F. 281, 50 L.R.A. 609; and California Apparel Creators v. Wieder (C.A.2), 162 F.2d 893, 174 A.L.R. 481, merit any discussion.
