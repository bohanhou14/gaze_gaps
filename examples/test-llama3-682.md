The case of Former Employees of Advanced Electronics, Inc. v. United States is a significant one in the realm of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA). The plaintiffs, three former employees of Advanced Electronics, Inc., sought certification for TAA and ATAA benefits under the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. The Department of Labor (Labor) denied their eligibility, concluding that the statutory requirements for eligibility had not been satisfied.

The court, exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(d)(1), reviewed Labor's determination. The court found that Labor's investigation was inadequate, as it failed to determine whether an increase in imports of printed circuit boards contributed importantly to the termination of the manufacturing operations of Advanced Electronics in Boston. The court noted that Labor's findings were supported by substantial evidence, but the investigation did not provide a complete picture of the cause of the decline in the Company's sales to the foreign customer.

The court relied on the principles set forth in 19 U.S.C. § 2272(a)(2)(A), which requires that increased imports of like or directly competitive articles contribute importantly to the employees' separation and to the decline in the sales or production of the employing firm. The court also cited Estate of Finkel v. Donovan, 9 CIT 374, 614 F.Supp. 1245 (1985), which held that the term "contributed importantly" suggests a direct and substantial relationship between increased imports and a decline in sales or production.

In conclusion, the court remanded the case to Labor, ordering it to reopen its investigation and issue a new determination grounded in appropriate findings of fact that are supported by substantial evidence. The court emphasized the importance of a thorough investigation in determining eligibility for TAA and ATAA benefits, citing the principles set forth in 19 U.S.C. § 2272(a)(2)(A) and Estate of Finkel v. Donovan, 9 CIT 374, 614 F.Supp. 1245 (1985).

gold_text: Estate of Finkel does not support defendant’s argument that “Labor was not obligated to investigate the American supplier’s imports because such imports, if they existed, would be insufficient to show the required connection between imports and AEI’s workers’ separation.” See Def.’s Mem. in Opp’n 6. Labor’s valid findings in this case (ie., those supported by substantial evidence), taken together, are not sufficient to rule out imports as an important causative factor. In Estate of Finkel, the Court of International Trade was not persuaded by plaintiffs’ argument that Labor should have considered (1) those customers who decreased purchases from the domestic producer and switched to imports, or to other domestic sources who had lowered their prices to compete with imports, and (2) the domestic producer’s inability to attract new customers due to increasing import penetration. Estate of Finkel, 9 CIT at 382-83, 614 F.Supp. at 1251-52. Plaintiffs argument in Estate of Finkel concerning customers who switched to imports was refuted by Labor’s finding that such switching was relatively insignificant. See id. at 383, 614 F.Supp. at 1252. The effect of domestic sources who lowered their prices to compete with imports and the effect of import penetration on the producer’s inability to attract new customers, both of which were characterized as indirect effects in the opinion in Estate of Finkel, are not analogous to what plaintiffs are alleging in this case. See id. at 382-83, 614 F.Supp. at 1251-52. Plaintiffs are alleging, in essence, that imports into the United States, after re-exportation, could have displaced the printed circuit boards the Company previously supplied to the foreign customer and that Labor’s investigation was inadequate because it did not consider this possibility. Pis.’ Remand Resp. 2-3. The court declines to adopt a construction of the Act under which Labor need never consider, in any circumstances, whether increased imports of a like or directly competitive article contributed importantly to a plaintiffs separation by causing the employer to lose business from a customer outside of the United States. Moreover, the Department has not indicated that it based its own decision on such a construction. Any construction of the Act must consider the remedial purpose of this statute and interpret its provisions so as to effectuate the statutory purpose. Woodrum, 5 CIT at 198, 564 F.Supp. at 832 (“It is true ... that the remedial nature of the [TAA] statute requires a liberal construction.”) (citing United Shoe Workers of Am. v. Bedell, 506 F.2d 174, 187 (D.C.Cir.1974)), af'd sub nom. Woodrum v. United States, 737 F.2d at 1576; see also Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336, 88 S.Ct. 548, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967) (stating that the Supreme Court is “guided by the familiar canon of statutory construction that remedial legislation should be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes”).
