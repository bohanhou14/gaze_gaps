The court grants the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claims of sexual harassment, sex discrimination, and retaliation. The plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim for relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The court holds that the plaintiff's allegations of sexual harassment and sex discrimination are insufficient to state a claim. The plaintiff's claims are based on the same allegations of sexual misconduct, which were investigated by the Department of Defense and found to be false. The plaintiff's allegations of sexual harassment and sex discrimination are therefore not supported by any evidence and are not sufficient to state a claim.

The court also holds that the plaintiff's allegations of retaliation are insufficient to state a claim. The plaintiff's allegations of retaliation are based on the defendant's alleged failure to investigate the plaintiff's complaints of sexual harassment and sex discrimination. However, the court holds that the defendant's failure to investigate the plaintiff's complaints does not constitute retaliation.

In conclusion, the court grants the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claims of sexual harassment, sex discrimination, and retaliation. The plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim for relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

gold_text: With respect to the sex discrimination and retaliation claims, a plaintiff must allege that he or she has suffered an adverse employment action. Loyd v. Phillips Brothers, Inc. 25 F.3d 518, 522-23 (7th Cir.1994) (sex discrimination); Reed v. Shepard, 939 F.2d 484, 492 (7th Cir.1991) (retaliation). In this case, both claims must fail because her allegations do not rise to the level of an adverse employment action.
