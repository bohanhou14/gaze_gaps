In addition to the points analyzed, it is crucial to recognize that uncertainties regarding jurisdiction must be resolved in favor of remand, as underscored by precedents. The principle articulated in the case 31 F.3d 1092 emphasizes that when there is any doubt, remand is preferred due to the inherent imbalance in the plaintiff's right to choose the forum and the defendant's right to remove. Specifically, the ruling in this case clarifies that "uncertainties are resolved in favor of remand" (31 F.3d 1092).

Furthermore, the analysis related to ERISA preemption from case 147 F.3d 1325 can be analogically applied to highlight that preemption claims must be clearly substantiated. In said case, the court concluded that no ERISA “plan” existed, which directed the case back to the state court (147 F.3d 1325). This demonstrates the necessity for defendants to present definitive evidence of fraudulent joinder, and not merely speculative assertions, to maintain federal jurisdiction.

The underpinning rationale from these cases substantively supports the conclusion that remand is warranted, as defendants have not met the stringent burden required to prove fraudulent joinder. Thus, the motion to remand is granted, aligned with the strict interpretation of removal statutes.
