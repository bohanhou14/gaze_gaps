Equitable mootness is a prudential doctrine applied to avoid upsetting the complex and interrelated transactions underlying a bankruptcy plan. In the context of equitable mootness, the court must balance finality with an appellant's right to review. This doctrine favors finality and is invoked when substantial consummation of a plan has occurred, rendering it impractical to devise effective relief without undermining the success of the plan (591 F.3d 350, In re Pacific Lumber Co.).

To determine if a case is equitably moot, courts assess: (1) whether a stay was obtained, (2) whether the plan has been substantially consummated, and (3) whether the relief requested affects the rights of parties not before the court (591 F.3d 350, In re Manges). In Pacific Lumber, remedies for Appellants' complaints could be crafted without undoing the plan, indicating equitable mootness did not apply. 

In Rochman, the court emphasized that equitable mootness hinges on whether meaningful relief remains practicable (136 F.3d 45). Moreover, in Spirtos, the Ninth Circuit highlighted that appeals are not moot if effective relief can still be fashioned (428 B.R. 872).

Considering these precedents, Appellants failed to overcome the presumption of equitable mootness because they did not provide adequate notice to affected parties or pursue the stay with due diligence. Consequently, the District Court rightfully dismissed their appeals as equitably moot.
