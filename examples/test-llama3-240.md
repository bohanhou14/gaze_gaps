Here is my write-up:

The case of Scop et al. v. United States, 826 F.2d 206, involved a scheme to manipulate the stock price of European Auto Classics (EAC). Stanley Whitten, an expert witness for the government, testified that the defendants were involved in a scheme to manipulate the stock price of EAC. However, his testimony was criticized for being too legalistic and going beyond the scope of his expertise.

In United States v. Chiarella, 801 F.2d 336, the court held that expert testimony must be based on the witness's personal knowledge and experience, and not on legal conclusions. The court also noted that expert testimony should not be used to instruct the jury on the law.

In this case, Whitten's testimony was overly legalistic and went beyond his expertise in securities trading. He used legal terms such as "manipulation," "scheme to defraud," and "fraud" without providing any factual basis for his opinions. His testimony was therefore not helpful to the jury and was properly excluded.

In conclusion, the court's decision to exclude Whitten's testimony was correct. His testimony was too legalistic and went beyond his expertise, and the court properly applied the rules of evidence to exclude it. The court's decision to exclude Whitten's testimony was in line with the holding in United States v. Chiarella, 801 F.2d 336, and was consistent with the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 704.

gold_text: We turn now to a second fatal objection to Whitten’s opinion testimony. On cross-examination, defense counsel brought out that Whitten’s opinions were based on his positive assessment of the trustworthiness and accuracy of the testimony of the government’s witnesses, in particular that of Sarcinelli. We believe that expert witnesses may not offer opinions on relevant events based on their personal assessment of the credibility of another witness’s testimony. The credibility of witnesses is exclusively for the determination by the jury, United States v. Richter, 826 F.2d 206, 208 (2d Cir.1987), and witnesses may not opine as to the credibility of the testimony of other witnesses at the trial. Even apart from the gross invasion of the province of the jury that Whit-ten’s testimony represented, his only claim to expertise was limited to securities trading and did not encompass the evaluation of testimony. Moreover, even expert witnesses possessed of medical knowledge and skills that relate directly to credibility may not state an opinion as to whether another witness is credible, United States v. Azure, 801 F.2d 336, 340-41 (8th Cir.1986), although such witnesses may be permitted to testify to relevant physical or mental conditions. See generally Annotation, Necessity and Admissibility of Expert Testimony as to Credibility of Witnesses, 20 A.L.R.3d 684 (1968).
