In reviewing the IRS's determination of the tax lien, the Court must apply the standard of review of "abuse of discretion." This standard is applicable where the validity of the underlying tax liability is not at issue. In this case, the Talens had previously challenged the underlying tax assessments and had an opportunity to dispute them at the administrative level. They had filed written protests disputing the assessments, which were considered by the Appeals Office and ultimately denied.

The IRS's determination to file a tax lien was based on the Talens' failure to present any collection alternatives or challenges to the appropriateness of the collection action. The Appeals Officer had reviewed the entire administrative record and determined that the assessments were properly and timely made. The Talens did not present any new information or alternatives for collection, and the IRS did not abuse its discretion in determining that the filing of the tax lien was the appropriate action.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court relies on the guidance provided by the Supreme Court in Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962), which states that an agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action. The Court also notes that the IRS's determination was not arbitrary or capricious, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(B).

Therefore, the Court grants the IRS's motion for summary judgment and determines that the IRS did not abuse its discretion in determining that the filing of the tax lien was the appropriate action.

Accordingly, the Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the IRS, but will determine whether the agency decision was based on the consideration, of relevant factors and whether there has been clear error.
