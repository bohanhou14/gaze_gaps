Movant requests an evidentiary hearing to support his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, the district court must hold an evidentiary hearing “unless the motion and files and records of the case show conclusively that the movant is not entitled to relief.” (28 U.S.C. § 2255; 410 F.3d at 131). The Third Circuit has established that failure to grant an evidentiary hearing when the case records do not conclusively resolve the issues constitutes an abuse of discretion (410 F.3d at 134; Solis v. United States, 252 F.3d 289, 294-95 (3d Cir. 2001)).

In this case, movant’s allegations and the records clearly demonstrate that his trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective. Movant’s arguments, including those about sentencing disparities, acceptance of responsibility, and uncalled character witnesses, do not meet the "reasonably low threshold" for habeas petitioners to merit an evidentiary hearing (432 F.3d 542, quoting McCoy v. United States, 410 F.3d 124). Given that the factual record provides a conclusive basis to deny the motion, an evidentiary hearing is unnecessary. 

Accordingly, the court will deny movant’s request for an evidentiary hearing.

gold_text: Section 2255 requires a district court to hold an evidentiary hearing on a § 2255 motion unless the “motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show” that the movant is not entitled to relief. 28 U.S.C. § 2255; see also United States v. Booth, 432 F.3d 542, 545-46 (3d Cir.2005); United States v. McCoy, 410 F.3d 124, 131 (3d Cir.2005); Rule 8(a), 28 U.S.C. foll. § 2255. As previously explained, the record conclusively demonstrates that movant is not entitled to relief because his arguments are without merit. Therefore, the court will deny movant’s § 2255 motion without an evidentiary hearing.
