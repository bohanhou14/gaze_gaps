IV.
In evaluating the defendants’ responses, we reference established jurisprudence. Summary judgment can withstand scrutiny only if based on substantial evidence that meets evidence admission standards (see 895 F.2d 46). The defendants offered Hugo’s interrogatory responses without corroborative evidence, characterizing this as inadmissible hearsay when challenging actual reliance on the intended misrepresentation (see 959 F.2d 521). Interrogatory answers must be grounded in personal knowledge and admissible facts; otherwise, they lack probative force (895 F.2d 46).

Hugo's statement, unsupported by substantive proof, fails to surmount this evidentiary threshold. The court’s reliance on the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act further underscores that badges of fraud, once proven, create a strong presumption of fraudulent intent, dismissible only by concrete evidence of contrary purpose (Tex.Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 24.005).

Given that the defendants’ asserted motives lack sufficient evidentiary backing and are limited to self-serving statements without substantive support, the district court’s summary judgment aligns with precedent and statutory mandates. Hence, the absence of genuine issues of material fact warrants affirming the district court’s judgment.

gold_text: . The record also contains answers to interrogatories and an affidavit by Marta in which she also states that her father insisted on the transfer. This Court, however, cannot consider her answers or affidavit with respect to this assertion because it is not clear that Marta has personal knowledge of any agreement between her brother and father with respect to this transaction. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); Akin v. Q-L Investments, Inc., 959 F.2d 521, 530 (5th Cir.1992); Garside v. Oseo Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir.1990). In the interrogatories, Marta did execute a statement declaring that she has personal knowledge of all facts contained therein, but her answers also state Hugo provided her with information to complete the answers. Given the inconsistencies of these statements and no comparable declaration of personal knowledge in the affidavit, this Court cannot consider those materials.
