Analyzing the legal cases, it is clear that the conditions of the shower area, including the stopped-up shower drain, plaster chippings from the ceiling, and worn-down grip strips, do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. In the case of McCollan v. United States, 443 U.S. 137 (1979), the Supreme Court held that a pretrial detainee's protection from punishment under the Fourteenth Amendment is not applicable to ordinary negligence claims. Similarly, in the case of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), the Court established that a pretrial detainee's protection from punishment under the Fourteenth Amendment requires a degree of harm, which is not present in this case.

Furthermore, the presence of black mold in the shower, without any allegations of harm, does not constitute an Eighth Amendment violation. In the case of Santiago v. Guarini, No. 03-4375, 2004 WL 2137822 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 20, 2004), the Court held that a toilet and sink leak in an inmate's cell, which caused a slip-and-fall injury, did not present a substantial risk to the inmate's safety and were not objectively serious conditions.

In conclusion, the conditions of the shower area and the presence of black mold in the shower do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation, and the plaintiff's claims of negligence are not actionable under ยง 1983. The Court will dismiss the plaintiff's federal claims without prejudice and decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. See 99 S. Ct. 2689 (1979).
