The appellants further argue that the district court's discretion to tax costs against in forma pauperis litigants should be exercised sparingly, citing concerns about deterring meritorious claims. They refer to Jones v. Bales, 58 F.R.D. 453, which underscores the broad discretion courts have in dismissing frivolous suits brought by indigent prisoners due to the lack of financial risks faced by such litigants. Nevertheless, the precedent set in Boyce v. Alizaduh, 595 F.2d 948, reaffirms that district courts possess "extremely broad" discretion under § 1915(d) to manage their dockets effectively. Consequently, adhering to the principle that costs should generally be assessed as in other cases under Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 54(d), we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's actions. The judgments of the district court, including the assessment of costs, are thus affirmed. 

AFFIRMED.

However, we adopt the district court’s reasoning that references to immunity from costs apparently “indicate the inability of a court or prevailing party to enforce a judgment against one who has no money rather than indicating any shield erected by the grant of in forma pauperis status.” 80 F.R.D. at 28.
