The case at hand involves the investigation of Delores M. Walker by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding her alleged tax evasion. The IRS conducted an undercover investigation, posing as a representative of a business investment group, and gathered evidence through deceit and trickery. Walker argues that the evidence obtained should be suppressed under the Fifth Amendment, citing United States v. Tweel, 550 F.2d 297 (5th Cir.1977), which held that the government may not utilize evidence obtained through deceit and trickery.

However, the court finds that the Fifth Amendment is not implicated in this case, as the IRS agent, James Lake, acted in an undercover capacity, not as an official agent of the government. United States v. Centennial Builders, Inc., 747 F.2d 678 (11th Cir.1984), supports this conclusion, holding that statements obtained in the course of undercover investigations do not fall within the traditional protection of the Fifth Amendment.

The court also notes that the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of undercover investigations in Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966), and that the government's power to initiate and utilize undercover investigations is not without bounds. Additionally, the court finds that the IRS had reason to investigate Walker and that Lake obtained specific approval for the Individual Information Gathering Assignment (IIGA) from his supervisor.

In conclusion, the court affirms the decision of the district court, finding that the evidence obtained in the undercover investigation was properly obtained and that no constitutional violation occurred. The court's decision is consistent with the principles established in reference cases such as 414 U.S. 70, 385 U.S. 511, and 385 U.S. 493.

She states that Lake lured her with promises to purchase her business at a time when she was most vulnerable and cites Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 94 S.Ct. 316, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (1973); Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511, 87 S.Ct. 625, 17 L.Ed.2d 574 (1967); and Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 562 (1967), in support of her position. Unlike the present case, custodial interrogation clearly occurred in each of those cases. Additionally, each of those defendants was confronted with a Hobson’s choice and thus the magnitude of the duress greatly exceeded that which defendant here alleges.
