In alignment with these principles, the key consideration is whether the circuit breakers were prepared in a manner that qualifies them as "packages" under § 4(5) of COGSA. As evidenced in Nichimen Company v. M.V. Farland, 462 F.2d 319 (2d Cir. 1972), the court emphasized that while the bill of lading description is not absolutely determinative, it is significant evidence of the parties’ intent. Furthermore, in Pannell v. The SS American Flyer, 451 F.2d 24, the importance of the bill of lading and its terms concerning on-deck cargo was underlined. 

Applying the rationale set forth in Aluminios Pozuelo Ltd. v. S.S. Navigator, 407 F.2d 152 (2d Cir. 1968), and the established importance of facilitating handling as a criterion for a "package," this Court finds that the partially crated circuit breakers meet the threshold for "package" status under § 4(5) of COGSA. The provision of some level of packaging, even if partial, supports this classification as it serves the purpose of facilitating transportation.

In conclusion, the existing legal precedents and the factual context firmly guide this Court to uphold the classification of the circuit breakers as "packages," thereby limiting the liability to $500 per package as stipulated in § 4(5) of COGSA.

gold_text: In other words packaging for protection, whether complete or partial, should be considered as constituting a package within § 4(5) of COGSA. The Court of Appeals has recognized that packaging may serve a dual purpose so that the existence of another purpose “does not necessarily negate the possibility that it is also packaging preparation made to facilitate handling in transportation.” Nichimen Company v.
