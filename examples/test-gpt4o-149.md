In deciding whether the district court's departure was permissible, we turn to the standards established in prior cases. For example, in *United States v. Diaz-Villafane*, 874 F.2d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 1989), the court emphasized that departures are atypical and justified only when specific criteria are met. This case sets a precedent that requires careful scrutiny of each step in the departure process. Furthermore, in *United States v. Rivera*, 994 F.2d 942, 950-52 (1st Cir. 1993), it was emphasized that departures must be substantively reasonable and grounded in sound fact-finding.

Applying these principles, the district court's interpretation of the customs tax guideline (U.S.S.G. ยง 2T3.1) to measure an alternative measure of harm aligns with such guided departures. However, the methodology should strictly adhere to the primary offense calculation before considering departures, ensuring that deviations are well-justified, as underscored in *United States v. Mendez-Colon*, 15 F.3d 188, 189 (1st Cir. 1994).

Given these precedents, the district court's departure to an adjusted offense level of 14 could be justified, provided the departure process is followed correctly. As established in *Reference case 53 F.3d 398*, each reason provided for the departure should be legally sustainable, factually supported on whole-record review, and substantively reasonable.

The decision to vacate and remand for resentencing follows these jurisprudential guidelines, reinforcing the necessity for the district judge to explicitly recognize and articulate the departure.
