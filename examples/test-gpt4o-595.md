In considering Naranjo's claim of sentencing entrapment, the district court erred in not making explicit findings. The Ninth Circuit has previously recognized that government conduct may indeed constitute sentencing entrapment warranting a downward departure (38 F.3d 1103). As stated in United States v. Staufer, sentencing entrapment occurs when a defendant predisposed to commit a minor offense is entrapped into committing a more severe crime (923 F.2d 607). The district court should have applied this principle rigorously.

The DEA's insistence on a higher quantity, despite Naranjo's demonstrated capacity and inclination for smaller deals, supports the argument for sentencing entrapment. Naranjo's genuine disinterest in dealing larger quantities, backed by multiple refusals and financial constraints, juxtaposes the DEA's aggressive tactics, thereby potentially inflating his culpability artificially.

Therefore, the absence of specific factual findings on sentencing entrapment, as mandated by Application Notes 12 and 17 to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1., and highlighted in Staufer, necessitates a remand for accurate reassessment. The district court must delineate its reasoning in determining the extent of Naranjo's predisposition and the DEA's influence on the transaction scale.
