In the case of Kreso v. United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the court affirms the decision of the Disciplinary Appeals Board ("DAB") to terminate the employment of Dr. Kreso. The DAB found that Dr. Kreso failed to attend to patients, neglected a patient by delaying care, and engaged in disruptive behavior.

The court reviews the DAB's decision under the highly deferential standard set out in 38 U.S.C. § 7462(f)(2), which requires that the decision be supported by substantial evidence. The court finds that the DAB's findings are supported by substantial evidence, citing cases such as Rosewitz v. Latting, 689 F.2d 175 (10th Cir.1982), and Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972).

The court also addresses Dr. Kreso's argument that the penalty imposed by the DAB was arbitrary and capricious. The court finds that the DAB's decision to terminate Dr. Kreso's employment was not arbitrary and capricious, citing cases such as Douglas v. Veterans Administration, 5 MSPB 313 (1981), and MacKay v. DEA, 664 F.3d 808 (10th Cir.2011).

Finally, the court addresses Dr. Kreso's argument that he was denied procedural due process. The court finds that Dr. Kreso was given adequate notice of the charges against him and was given an opportunity to present his side of the story, citing cases such as Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), and Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422 (1982).

In conclusion, the court affirms the decision of the DAB to terminate Dr. Kreso's employment. The DAB's findings are supported by substantial evidence, and the penalty imposed was not arbitrary and capricious. Dr. Kreso's due process rights were also not violated.

gold_text: Kreso asserts he was not allowed to cross-examine witnesses Patricia Lyman, Sylvia Murray, Karla Perkins, Kim Ator, Michael Blieden, Francis Keffler, Mark Phillips, Carlos Montoya, and Ann Jodway to expose “their inconsistencies, and bias.” Kreso does not explain who these witnesses are, at what stage in the proceedings they testified, or what he believes to be their alleged inconsistencies and biases. In discussing this claim, the district court concluded several of. these witnesses did not testify at the DAB hearing either because Kreso successfully had them removed from the witness list or because Kreso made no effort to obtain their testimony at the hearing. In his opening brief, Kreso does not identify the efforts he undertook to call the remaining individuals as witnesses at the DAB hearing, or how any such efforts were thwarted by the VA. See West v. Grand Cty., 967 F.2d 362, 369 (10th Cir.1992) (holding a due process claim failed because the plaintiff did not seek to require a witnesses’s attendance at a post-termination grievance hearing and was not “inhibited or restricted from doing so”). In his reply brief, however, Kreso asserts he supplied the VA with a witness list and the VA was responsible for securing the attendance of any witness on that list who was employed by the VA. Kreso references a letter his counsel sent to the chairperson of the DAB in which he requested that the VA make seven individuals available at the hearing. Of the seven names included in Kreso’s letter, only Ann Jodway is also mentioned in Kreso’s appellate briefing. Although Kreso argues he was denied the right to cross-examine Ms. Jodway to expose her biases, he does not identify any statements she made to the AIB or the DAB and it appears he, instead, considered her a character witness. See SIL-FLO, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1513-14 (10th Cir.1990) (setting out the well-established rule that this court does not sift through the record to find evidence supporting a party’s position). This court does not engage in speculation. Kreso’s due process argument as to Ms. Jodway fails because he has wholly failed to present any meaningful argument that this court can address. See Meder v. Okla. City, 869 F.2d 553, 555 (10th Cir.1989) (holding due process claim failed because plaintiff failed to explain “how confrontation and cross-examination would have changed the” outcome of his hearing), abrogated on other grounds by Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 59, 119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999).
