The petitioner’s approach mirrors the issues presented in Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, where the claim of actual innocence served as a gateway to bring forth constitutional errors. Crucially, Schlup emphasized that innocence claims must be coupled with substantive constitutional errors to merit habeas relief, notably highlighted in 513 U.S., at 315. Here, the petitioner provides two primary assertions in his second post-conviction motion: newly discovered evidence and improper sentencing due to a combative situation — issues which could potentially circumvent procedural bars if they demonstrate constitutional errors similar to those noted in Schlup's case.

Furthermore, in assessing procedural fairness, it is pertinent to consider Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, wherein the Supreme Court held that claims of actual innocence alone do not entitle petitioners to federal habeas relief unless paired with claims of constitutional violations, as clarified in 506 U.S., at 416. Jackson’s claim involving new evidence and incorrect offense variable scoring due to a combative situation could signify such constitutional claims, thus warranting careful judicial review.

Given these arguments, the Court will require a detailed analysis of the petitioner's assertions to determine if his claims indeed parallel the standards set in Herrera and Schlup cases, thereby justifying a departure from the typical statute of limitations constraints under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1).

Considering these precedents, the motion to dismiss based on untimeliness is denied, and the motion to hold the answer in abeyance is granted, ensuring the constitutional claims are adequately addressed pursuant to applicable legal standards.

gold_text: The respondent contends that the gravamen of the petitioner’s second motion presents a free-standing claim of actual innocence, which is insufficient to constitute a “federally cognizable claim” under Austin. The respondent cites Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993), for that proposition, and argues therefore that the petitioner’s post-conviction motion does not qualify as such under Section 2244(d)(1). In Herrera, the Supreme Court reviewed a lower court ruling that dismissed a death row inmate’s second habeas petition in which he claimed that it was not he, but his now-deceased brother, who had committed the murder in that case. The Court held that a claim of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence alone does not state a federal constitutional claim. Id. at 400, 113 S.Ct. 853. “Few rulings would be more disruptive of our federal system than to provide for federal habeas review of freestanding claims of actual innocence.” Id. at 401, 113 S.Ct. 853. The Court clarified its position in Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995), explaining that actual innocence claims are relevant in federal habeas proceedings not as independent claims for relief, but as a justification to overcome procedural obstacles to consideration of other federal constitutional violations that rendered a trial unfair. The Court distinguished between a freestanding, substantive claim of actual innocence and a procedural claim of actual innocence. See id. at 314, 115 S.Ct. 851.
