V.
Appellants also argue that the district court incorrectly dismissed their pendent state law claims. The district court's decision is supported by precedent. In United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726 (1965), the Supreme Court recognized that federal courts have discretion to try state claims under pendent jurisdiction when they accompany substantial federal claims. However, in the instant case, since all federal claims were dismissed, the district court appropriately declined to exercise jurisdiction over the appended state claims.

In a similar context, the case of 564 F.2d 1093 elucidates that state claims should be dismissed without prejudice if the federal claims are dismissed, allowing plaintiffs the opportunity to pursue their state law claims in an appropriate state forum. Accordingly, the district court's dismissal of the state claims without prejudice in this case enables the appellants to bring their claims before a state court if they choose to do so. Therefore, the judgment of the district court is consistent with established legal principles on pendent jurisdiction.

VI.
In conclusion, the district court's dismissal of the appellants' claims under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, Title VI, the National Health Planning and Resource Development Act, the federal "whistle blowing" statute, and related state claims are affirmed. The appellants' failure to demonstrate state or federal action, standing, and requisite factual support for their claims necessitated dismissal. The case is VACATED AND REMANDED for proceedings consistent with the principles discussed herein.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
