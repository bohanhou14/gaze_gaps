The case presents a situation where the plaintiff, Columbo, alleges that she suffered from mental illness, including paranoia, panic attacks, and depression, which rendered her incapable of managing funds, making decisions, or caring for herself. She claims that she was unable to contact an EEO counselor within the time period specified, citing her mental illness as the reason.

In Canales v. Sullivan, 936 F.2d 755 (2d Cir.1991), the court held that the question of whether a person is sufficiently mentally disabled to justify tolling of a limitation period is highly case-specific and requires an examination of all the circumstances of the case. Boos v. Runyon, 201 F.3d 178 (2d Cir.2000), further emphasized that the burden of demonstrating the appropriateness of equitable tolling lies with the plaintiff.

In this case, Columbo's conclusory and vague claim of mental illness does not meet the burden of demonstrating the appropriateness of equitable tolling. Moreover, the plaintiff's failure to provide any particulars or documentation to support her claim, such as a copy of the EEO complaint, raises serious doubts about her ability to manage her case and comply with the time limits.

Furthermore, the court in Colon v. Potter, 51 Fed.Appx. 43, 46 (2d Cir.2002), emphasized that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies in only "rare and exceptional circumstances." Given the lack of specificity and documentation provided by Columbo, the court finds that the doctrine of equitable tolling does not apply in this case.

Therefore, based on the lack of specificity and documentation provided by Columbo, the court finds that she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and dismisses her complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The court also denies Columbo's request for an extension of time to file an amended complaint.

Runyon, 201 F.3d 178, 184 (2d Cir.2000). The burden lies with the party seeking tolling to provide that it is appropriate. Colon, 51 Fed.Appx. at 46 (citing Chapman v. ChoiceCare Long Island Term Disability Plan, 288 F.3d 506, 512 (2d Cir.2002)). Because “mental illnesses are as varied as physical illnesses ... conclusory and vague claim, without a particularized description ... is manifestly insufficient to justify any further inquiry into tolling.” Boos, 201 F.3d at 185.
