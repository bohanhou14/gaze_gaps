OPINION OF THE COURT
The National Labor Relations’ Board (“Board”) seeks enforcement of its November 8, 1968, Order against respondents United Mine Workers, of America (“UMW”), United Mine Workers of America, District 2 (“District 2”), and United Mine Workers of America, Local 6796 (“Local 6796”). The Board found that respondents violated Section 8(b) (1) (A) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 158(b) (1) (A), by restraining and coercing employees of the Southern Labor Union (“SLU”) in their exercise of rights guaranteed in Section 7, 29 U.S.C. § 157.

The case involves two incidents: the SLU meeting scheduled for December 17, 1967, and the Mears Coal Company incident on January 30, 1968. In the first incident, UMW members and agents, including Simpson, the president of Local 6796, threatened non-strikers with loss of their jobs and physical harm, physically attacked one of the non-striking employees, and sabotaged the employer’s property. In the second incident, a crowd of over 75 men gathered at the Mears Coal Company plant, blocking the entrance and intimidating employees.

We approve the Board’s finding that respondents UMW, District 2, and Local 6796 violated Section 8(b) (1) (A). The evidence supports the Board’s finding that respondents were responsible for the incidents, and that their conduct was designed to restrain and coerce employees in the exercise of their rights. The cases of N.L.R.B. v. Taxicab Drivers Union, Local 777, 340 F.2d 905, 909 (7 Cir.1964), and N.L.R.B. v. Dressmakers Joint Council, International Ladies’ Garment Workers Union, AFL-CIO, 342 F.2d 988 (2 Cir.1965), enforcing 146 N.L.R.B. 559 (1964), are relevant to this case.

The Board’s finding of liability is supported by the evidence, and we find no merit in the contentions advanced by respondents to justify their conduct. The cases of N.L.R.B. v. Ford, 170 F.2d 735, 738 (6th Cir. 1948

The burning of the dynamited Mears Company office building was plainly action taken in consonance with the earlier made threats against the Company for employing SLU members. We concur in the Board’s finding that respondents UMW and District 2 are liable for this illegal conduct.
