In the case at hand, the defendant, Damon Lucky, was arrested for being a felon in possession of a firearm. During jury selection, Lucky refused to participate, stating that he would not change into civilian clothing or participate in jury selection until all pretrial motions were resolved. The court advised Lucky that his decision was unwise, but he persisted. The court subsequently found that Lucky had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to be present during jury selection.

The court's decision was supported by the reference case 506 U.S. 255, which held that a defendant's right to be present during trial may be waived if they voluntarily, knowingly, and without justification absent themselves from the trial. In this case, Lucky's actions were voluntary and intentional, and he refused to participate in jury selection despite the court's advisement.

Similarly, the reference case 208 F.3d 27 supported the court's decision. In that case, the court held that a defendant's right to be present during trial may be waived if the court properly exercises its discretion in finding that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived the right.

In conclusion, the court's decision to proceed with jury selection in Lucky's absence was justified, as he had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to be present during jury selection. The court's decision was also supported by the reference cases, which established that a defendant's right to be present during trial may be waived under certain circumstances.

gold_text: On the facts before us, the District Court did not err in concluding that Defendant waived his right to be present for jury selection and that continuing with jury selection was in the public interest. See Cuoco v. United States, 208 F.3d 27, 32 (2d Cir.2000); see also Crosby v. United States, 506 U.S. 255, 262, 113 S.Ct. 748, 122 L.Ed.2d 25 (1993) (noting that if a defendant fled after the start of trial, the defendant would know that the likely consequence would be that the trial would continue in his absence). Defendantâ€™s argument, therefore, fails.
