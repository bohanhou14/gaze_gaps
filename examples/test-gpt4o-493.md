The determination of when a tax is incurred is pivotal in classifying the priority of the tax claims. As established by In re Scrap Disposal, Inc., 24 B.R. 178, the date of accrual rather than the date of assessment controls. This principle was reiterated in United States v. Redmond, 36 B.R. 932, and further applied in In re Davidson Lumber Co., 47 B.R. 597. Here, the taxes incurred as of the fiscal year-end, February 23, 1991, are appropriately considered prepetition taxes and should not be granted administrative expense status under Section 503. 

This interpretation aligns with the analysis in In re Carlisle Court, Inc., 36 B.R. 209, which stated that claims relating back to pre-bankruptcy income tax liabilities were not incurred by the estate and hence, do not qualify as administrative expenses. Consequently, the prepetition taxes must be accorded seventh level priority under Section 507(a)(7), consistent with In re Scrap Disposal, Inc., 38 B.R. 765.

Therefore, the Court acknowledges the necessity to categorize the taxes based on their allocable income period, ensuring that prepetition taxes are treated with seventh level priority and postpetition taxes attain an administrative priority as ruled in In re Redmond, 57 B.R. 932.

Other courts have held that "[a] tax is incurred on the date it accrues, not on the date of assessment or the date it is payable.” In re Overly-Hautz Co., 57 B.R. 932, 937 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 1986) (citing United States v. Redmond, 36 B.R. 932 (D.Kansas 1984); In re Davidson Lumber Co., 47 B.R. 597 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1985); and In re Scrap Disposal, Inc., 24 B.R. 178 (Bankr.S.D.Calif.1982), aff’d 38 B.R. 765 (Bankr.9th Cir. BAP 1984)). In Overly-Hautz, the claim was for excise taxes for tax years which occurred entirely prepetition. 57 B.R. at 937.
