The provided references are legal cases that discuss the jurisdiction and appealability of bankruptcy court orders. In the case of In re Zahn, the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of the Chapter 13 plan due to the failure to include distributions from the non-filing husband's individual retirement account (IRA). The court ruled that the plan was not final and appealable, citing In re Fichen, 2 F.3d 299, 300 (8th Cir.1993), which states that an order is not final unless it effectively terminates the proceeding on the merits.

However, the court in In re Zahn acknowledged that the order became final after the bankruptcy court entered its order dismissing the case, citing In re Bentley, 266 B.R. 229, 233 (B.A.P. 1st Cir.2001). The court also referred to In re Parque Forestal, Inc., 949 F.2d 504, 508 (1st Cir.1991), which held that a district court's appellate order was final and appealable even if the underlying bankruptcy court order was not final at the time it was appealed.

In the context of the provided references, the court in In re Zahn concluded that the bankruptcy court's order denying confirmation of the plan was final and appealable, and that the debtor has standing to appeal the order. The court cited In re Farmland Indus., Inc., 397 F.3d 647, 650 (8th Cir.2005), which states that a party has standing to appeal a bankruptcy court order if they are an aggrieved party, which in this case, the debtor was.

The court also referred to In re Pleasant Woods Assoc. Ltd. P'ship, 2 F.3d 837, 838 (8th Cir.1993), which held that the rejection of a debtor's proposed plan may yet be considered on appeal from a final judgment either confirming an alternative plan, or dismissing the underlying petition or proceeding. The court in In re Zahn concluded that the confirmation of the plan was a final order and it was appealable, citing In re Farmland, 397 F.3d at 650, and In re Broken Bow Ranch, 33 F.3d 1005, 1008 (8th Cir.1994).

In conclusion, the references provided demonstrate that the bankruptcy court's order denying confirmation of the plan was final and

gold_text: Concerned that orders denying confirmation “never receive appellate review” because they are not considered final orders, the BAP invites us to revisit the current state of the law in this circuit regarding the finality of such orders. We decline the BAP’s invitation. Under Eighth Circuit law, which is consistent with the views of other circuits, an order denying confirmation of a plan, which does not dismiss the case, is not a final order and cannot be appealed. See Lewis, 992 F.2d at 772 (holding a “bankruptcy order, which neither confirms a plan nor dismisses the underlying petition, is not final”); see also In re Groves, 39 F.3d 212, 214 (8th Cir.1994); and In re Pleasant Woods, 2 F.3d at 838; see also, for example, In re Watson, 403 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.2005); In re Massey, 21 Fed.Appx. 113, 114 (4th Cir.2001); and In re Lievsay, 118 F.3d 661, 662-63 (9th Cir.1997). Such orders leave the way open for negotiations and approval of a modified plan. Because a debtor can obtain meaningful relief either by amending her plan or, as in this case, objecting to her own amended plan and appealing the amended plan’s confirmation, we do not see the need to alter our precedent that an order denying confirma tion, without dismissal of the case, is not an appealable final order.
