In the case at hand, we find that the May agreement, the memorandum, and the August agreement provided for the petitioner to purchase the stock of Mr. Gottlieb and to sell it to Mr. Glassman and Lester Mittleman. The evidence offered by the petitioner falls short of constituting strong proof that their true agreement was other than that set forth in such written agreements, as stated in Ullman v. Commissioner, 264 F. 2d 305 (C.A. 2, 1959), affirming 29 T.C. 129 (1957).

The petitioner denies that he realized any gain as a result of Mr. Glassman's withdrawal from the arrangement. However, when in 1963, Mr. Glassman left the employ of the corporations, he had paid $60,600 toward the purchase of stock which was to cost $105,000; only $40,783 was returned to him. The petitioner offered no satisfactory evidence to support his contention that the amount returned to Mr. Glassman represented the fair market value of his interest at that time. As far as we can determine, the amount of $19,817 remained in the hands of Mr. Gottlieb as partial payment of the petitioner's obligation under the May agreement.

In reference case 50 T.C. 273, the court held that a gain resulting from an adjustment of a purchase price should be taxable as a capital gain. However, in the present case, the gain resulting from Mr. Glassman's withdrawal from the arrangement is taxable as ordinary income, as stated in reference case 32 T.C. 1188.

Moreover, the memorandum specified that Mr. Glassman was to pay a total of $105,000 for a 25-percent interest in the corporations. Until he paid the full amount, he was not to be a stockholder in the corporations. The powers given to him by the memorandum with respect to such stock were provided in order to expand his involvement in the business. There is no evidence that title and possession of the stock were to be his before he had paid in full for his entire interest.

In reference case 32 B.T.A. 156, the court held that a payment made by a vendor as liquidated damages for the vendee's default in performing a contract was taxable as ordinary income. Similarly, in the present case, the gain resulting from Mr. Glassman's withdrawal from the arrangement is

gold_text: In our opinion, tMs case is distinguishable from Lowe. Here, no sale took place; there was merely a contract by the petitioner to sell stock to Mr. Glassman. The gain realized by the petitioner in 1963 resulted from the operation of paragraph 3 of the memorandum. Under that provision, if Mr. Glassman did not remain with the cor porations until be completed paying for bis interest in the stock, only a portion of the payments made by him were to be returned to him. In effect, the portion not returned to Mr. Glassman constituted liquidated damages payable as a result of bis failure to complete the purchase of Stock under the memorandum. On a number of occasions, we have held that such gain does not result from the sale or exchange of a capital asset and therefore must be treated as ordinary income. Harold S. Smith, 50 T.C. 273 (1968), affirmed per curiam 418 F. 2d 573 (C.A. 9, 1969); Ralph A. Boatman, 32 T.C. 1188 (1959); A. M. Johnson, 32 B.T.A. 156 (1935).
