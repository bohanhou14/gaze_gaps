In its defense, Swanee contends that it should not be held liable for the violation since it acted without explicit knowledge of the benefit conferred upon Grand Union. However, the principles established in reference case 344 U.S. 33 underscore the necessity for litigants to raise objections during administrative proceedings to provide agencies an opportunity for correction. The failure to do so precludes challenges before the courts, thereby underscoring Swanee's inaction in addressing these concerns timely.

Furthermore, in reference case 334 U.S. 37, the Supreme Court emphasized that regulatory bodies must be granted the primary role in determining potential competition injury issues, thus reinforcing the Commission’s authority to make determinations about Section 2(d) violations. The factual parallels in these citations substantiate the ratification of the Commission’s conclusions about Swanee’s violations.

Therefore, while Swanee’s actions were not egregious or recurrent, their singularity and premature cessation do not absolve the legal breach. The guiding precedents affirm the Commission's stance but caution against overly broad injunctions unrelated to the specific violations adjudicated.

gold_text: It is true that Swanee did not object to the order during the proceedings below and that orderly appellate review of administrative decisions usually requires that such objections be made. See United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, 1952, 344 U.S. 33, 73 S.Ct. 67, 97 L.Ed. 54. Swanee did object to the order, however, in its petition to review, and at the time this was filed, the Commission could have modified its order if it had so wished. See 15 U.S.C.A. § 21(b). Moreover, the order as written is so broad that, under the new enforcement provisions of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.A. § 21), the duty of enforcing the prohibitions of Section 2(d) as to Swanee is shifted from the Commission to the federal courts, which may in the future be forced to decide the very issues that Congress has entrusted the Commission to determine. See F. T. C. v. Morton Salt Co., 1948, 334 U.S. 37, 68 S.Ct. 822, 92 L.Ed. 1196. Proper judicial administration requires that the order be modified, and we therefore hold that the order should be limited to the particular practice found to violate the statute.
