The district court did not err in dismissing Moser's claims for intentional interference with contract. Under California law, a claim for intentional interference requires evidence that the defendant's intentional acts induced a breach or disruption of the contract (525 F.3d 822). Moser failed to provide admissible evidence linking the appellees to any such disruption. Similar to the case with Park Place and Freddie Mac, where testimony based on hearsay was deemed insufficient (525 F.3d 822), Moser's claims lacked substantiation.

Further, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Moser’s negligence claim. Plaintiffs in such cases must establish proximate cause, demonstrating that the defendant's actions were the foreseeable cause of the harm (567 F.3d 554). Just as the unforeseeable and extraordinary nature of the suicide in the referenced case led to dismissal (567 F.3d 554), Moser's assertions failed to show how the appellees’ actions foreseeably caused his alleged damages.

We affirm the district court’s application of the Eleventh Amendment and qualified immunity principles. Similar to how California school districts were deemed immune from § 1983 claims (567 F.3d 554), Moser’s claims against state actors also fall within the protection of Eleventh Amendment immunity. This independent legal basis further supports the summary judgment in favor of the appellees.

In summary, Moser's inability to present substantial and credible evidence for his claims, along with the proper application of immunity doctrines, justifies the district court’s decisions in these aspects.

gold_text: The district court erred in finding Moser’s claims against Triare time-barred. Because Moser did not sue Triare for defamation, his other tort claims do not merge into a defamation claim. A two-year statute of limitations applies to Mos-er’s timely claims against Triare. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 335.1, 339. However, the district court properly granted summary judgment for Triare. With respect to intentional interference with contract, Moser has failed to show that Triare took intentional acts to induce breach. Family Home & Fin. Ctr., Inc. v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 525 F.3d 822, 825 (9th Cir.2008). Additionally, Moser has not shown proximate causation. Allen v. Powell, 248 Cal.App.2d 502, 56 Cal.Rptr. 715, 718 (1967); Mayes v. Bryan, 139 Cal.App.4th 1075, 44 Cal.Rptr.3d 14, 25 (2006) (holding that a “substantial factor” creates a force that is in continuous and active operation up to the time of the harm). Nor can Moser show that the settlement agreement would have been performed, but for Triarc’s approval of the disclosure. Dryden v. Tri-Valley Growers, 65 Cal.App.3d 990, 135 Cal.Rptr. 720, 725 (1977). With respect to the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, Moser has not shown that Triare engaged in outrageous conduct. Corales v. Bennett, 567 F.3d 554, 571 (9th Cir.2009); Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 6 Cal.4th 965, 25 Cal.Rptr.2d 550, 574, 863 P.2d 795 (1993) (holding outrageous conduct exceeds all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community). Moser also has failed to show that he suffered severe emotional distress. Girard v. Ball, 125 Cal.App.3d 772, 178 Cal.Rptr. 406, 414 (1981) (holding severe emotional distress is of “such substantial quantity or enduring quality that no reasonable man in a civilized society should be expected to endure it”).
