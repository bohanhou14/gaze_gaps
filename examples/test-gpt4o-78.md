**Generation:**

In evaluating defendant's challenge to the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, we look to the guidelines set forth in U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1, which requires a willful obstruction or impediment of justice. According to United States v. Stroud, the term “willfully” necessitates a mens rea requirement, implying that the defendant must have had a specific intent to obstruct justice (893 F.2d 504, 507 (2d Cir.1990)). This intent is further echoed in United States v. Defeo, which emphasizes that the defendant must consciously act with the purpose of obstructing justice (36 F.3d 272, 276).

Defendant's argument that her failure to appear was due to drug use, lacking conscious intent to obstruct justice, does not align with the definition of willful obstruction under § 3C1.1. Additionally, as observed in United States v. Aponte, certain conduct such as intentionally failing to appear at judicial proceedings is inherently obstructive, and can warrant enhancement even if the specific purpose was not to obstruct justice (31 F.3d 86, 88). Given that failing to appear for a scheduled judicial proceeding directly falls under obstructive conduct, the district court did not err in applying a two-level enhancement for obstruction under § 3C1.1.

Therefore, considering the precedents and the circumstances of the defendant's actions, we find the district court's application of the enhancement justifiable and affirm its judgment.

gold_text: An adjustment under § 3C1.1 “is appropriate only upon a finding that the defendant had the ‘specific intent to obstruct justice, i.e., that the defendant consciously acted with the purpose of obstructing justice.’” United States v. Defeo, 36 F.3d 272, 276 (2d Cir.1994) (citation omitted). However, we have held that “[cjertain conduct ... such as intentionally failing to appear as required at judicial proceedings, is so inherently obstructive of the administration of justice that it is sufficient that the defendant willfully engaged in the underlying conduct, regardless of his specific purpose.” United States v. Reed, 49 F.3d 895, 900 (2d Cir.1995). For instance, in Defeo, we held that “[f]light from pretrial services between conviction and sentencing warrants an obstruction enhancement.” 36 F.3d at 276.
