Long further contends that the search of the 1997 Chevy Blazer, parked in the OC Store lot, violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The Blazer was registered to Nancy Big Eagle and Freedom Long, not Jason Long. Under established precedent, Fourth Amendment rights are personal and cannot be asserted vicariously. See Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 133-34 (1978). To challenge a search, Long must demonstrate a personal, reasonable expectation of privacy in the Blazer. See Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 88 (1998); United States v. Gomez, 16 F.3d 254, 256 (8th Cir. 1994).

Based on the evidence, Long failed to show such an expectation of privacy. Similar to the passengers in Rakas who could not challenge the search of an automobile's glove compartment, Long had no documented ownership or possessory interest in the Blazer. See Rakas, 439 U.S. at 148-49. Consequently, Long lacks standing to contest the search (Reference case: 379 F.3d 524).

Even absent a standing issue, the district court found the search valid under the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, as recognized in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (1984). The facts indicate that Officer Spargur and his team acted within the scope of the warrant in good faith (Reference case: 605 F.3d 604). Considering precedents and the evidential lack of ownership documents, we affirm the district court’s decision.

Therefore, any evidence obtained from the Blazer remains admissible, and the officers' actions did not violate Long’s Fourth Amendment rights (Reference case: 739 F.3d 391).

gold_text: Long also challenges the officers’ search of the Blazer parked in the OC Store’s public parking lot. “Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights that may not be asserted vicariously.” United States v. Barragan, 379 F.3d 524, 529 (8th Cir.2004). “To mount a successful motion to suppress, an accused must first establish that he personally has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the object that was searched.” United States v. Stringer, 739 F.3d 391, 396 (8th Cir.2014). Long admits he did not own the Blazer, and Long has provided no evidence suggesting he had any constitutionally protected connection to the vehicle or its contents. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 605 F.3d 604, 609 (8th Cir.2010) (deciding a defendant who “neither owned nor drove the [searched vehicle] and was only an occasional passenger therein” could not challenge the search of the vehicle). Long thus has shown no reasonable expectation of privacy in the Blazer and cannot now contest the search of the vehicle. See id.
