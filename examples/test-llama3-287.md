To answer the question, I'd like to analyze the case of Griffin v. Warden, Lebanon Corr. Inst., 748 F.3d 741 (6th Cir. 2014). In this case, the petitioner, Griffin, claimed that his guilty plea was involuntary because his attorney's ineffective assistance rendered the plea unknowing and unintelligent. The district court dismissed the petition, finding that the state court's adjudication was not an unreasonable application of Supreme Court case law.

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision, citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), which established the two-prong test for determining ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that Griffin failed to show that his attorney's performance was deficient or that he was prejudiced by the performance.

The court noted that Griffin's attorney admitted that he was "stuck" with pleading to what he "probably" believed was wrong, but did not have any other option because he felt he could not take the case to trial. The court also observed that Griffin's counsel stated that he would have loved to do things differently, but the State of Ohio refused to amend the charges or strike a plea based on the same issues discussed by the trial court.

In contrast, the court in McGowan v. United States, 788 F.3d 510 (6th Cir. 2014), found that a defendant's guilty plea was involuntary because his attorney's ineffective assistance rendered the plea unknowing and unintelligent. The court held that the trial court's finding of ineffective assistance was not clearly erroneous and that the defendant had failed to show that the trial court would have been willing to sentence him in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement.

In another case, Hodges v. United States, 727 F.3d 517 (6th Cir. 2013), the court rejected a defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, finding that the defendant failed to show that his attorney's performance was deficient or that he was prejudiced by the performance. The court noted that the defendant's attorney had advised him of the potential consequences of pleading guilty and that the defendant had understood the terms of the plea agreement.

In conclusion, the courts have consistently held that a defendant's guilty plea is involuntary if his attorney's ineffective assistance renders the plea unknowing and unintelligent. However, the courts have also emphasized the importance of considering

gold_text: First, it was not an unreasonable application of federal law to give more weight to petitioner’s contemporaneous expressions of unwillingness to proceed to trial— in the context of the trial court inquiring whether he wished to pursue a trial on the affirmative defense, no less — than a subsequent repudiation made after an adverse ruling and an opportunity to second-guess the decision. See McGowan v. Burt, 788 F.3d 510, 517 (6th Cir.2015), cert. denied — U.S. —, 136 S.Ct. 415, 193 L.Ed.2d 328 (2015) (mem.) (“[CJonsonant with Strickland’s cautionary note about a defendant’s natural tendency to second-guess his attorney’s assistance after an adverse judgment, the state court scrutinized [the petitioner’s] asserted misunderstanding in light of what was said at the time he rejected the plea offer without the distorting effects of hindsight.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Hodges v. Colson, 727 F.3d 517, 539 (6th Cir.2013) (“A self-serving statement ... filed as a required part of [the petitioner’s] verified petition for post-conviction relief, cannot establish a reasonable probability that [he] would have pled not guilty but for the advice of counsel, where all objective evidence points unequivocally to the contrary.”).
