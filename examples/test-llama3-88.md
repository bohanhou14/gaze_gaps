The case at hand, Sierra Club and Citizens for Clean Air and Water v. United States, et al., concerns the validity of a land exchange between the United States and two public utility companies, Toledo Edison Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. The plaintiffs argue that the exchange was improper and unauthorized, and seek a declaration that it is void and must be set aside as a nullity.

The defendants, including the Secretary of the Interior, move to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of sovereign immunity and lack of jurisdiction. The court agrees with the defendants, citing Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682 (1949), which holds that a court lacks jurisdiction to declare the validity of a transaction involving the sovereign.

The court also notes that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) does not apply to this case, as the exchange was committed to the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior by law. Furthermore, the court rejects the plaintiffs' argument that the Secretary's decision was arbitrary and capricious, citing the principle that an officer's decision is not invalid merely because it is incorrect, as long as it is within the scope of their statutory authority. See Ogletree v. McNamara, 449 F.2d 93 (6th Cir. 1971).

The court also references other cases, such as Hawaii v. Gordon, 373 U.S. 57 (1963), and Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609 (1956), which support the principle of sovereign immunity. Additionally, the court notes that the relief requested by the plaintiffs cannot be granted by merely ordering the cessation of the conduct complained of, but will require affirmative action by the sovereign or the disposition of unquestionably sovereign property, citing Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., supra.

In conclusion, the court dismisses the complaint, holding that it lacks jurisdiction to declare the validity of the land exchange and that the relief requested by the plaintiffs cannot be granted. The court's decision is supported by the principles of sovereign immunity and the Administrative Procedure Act. See also 370 F.2d 529, 417 F.2d 1310, 370 F.2d 686, 226 F.2d 416.
