In examining whether the debts in question are sufficiently related, it is prudent to refer to other relevant cases. For instance, in *In re Hill* (referenced in 161 B.R. 824), it was determined that both the mortgage and reserve accounts being consumer debts met the same class standard, which guided our present classification. The decision emphasized the necessity for debts to belong to a similar class without delving deeply into their minute specifics, reinforcing the notion that the classification test is primarily used to distinguish consumer from business transactions. 

Furthermore, in *In re Johnson* (9 B.R. 713), the courts similarly segregated consumer debts from business debts, implying that consumer credit, even in varying forms like open-end and closed-end agreements, can be perceived as belonging to a single class. This is consistent with the Wisconsin approach which suggests that the relatedness requirement, while rigorous, places significant focus on the nature of consumer versus business obligations.

Lastly, the decision in *217 B.R. 527* showcases the importance of adherence to procedural propriety and underscores how the absence of adverse or harassing actions by a creditor can influence judicial perceptions of good faith dealings in bankruptcy adjudications. Here, Blackhawk Credit Union's compliance with established statutes and lack of adversarial conduct could play a significant role in determining the fairness of extending the dragnet clause over the credit card debt.

Thus, based on the given facts and the guiding principles from these cases, it can be inferred that the James' credit card debt falls within the same class of obligations as the car loan and is sufficiently related to justify the application of Blackhawk’s dragnet clause.

gold_text: In addition to Swanson, at least two other cases have considered similar issues. See In re Robinson, 217 B.R. 527 (Bankr.E.D.Tex.1998) (Sharp, C.J.); In re Phillips, 161 B.R. 824 (Bankr.W.D.Mo.1993) (Koger, C.J.). In Robinson, the debtors received a credit card in 1989 from a credit union. 217 B.R. at 529. In 1991, the debtors purchased a Ford truck and took a secured car loan from a dealership. Id. at 529. The security interest was then assigned to the same credit union that had issued the credit card. Id. at 529, 532. The security agreement contained a cross-collateralization clause for all other debts between the parties. Id. at 529. In light of the fact that the dealership and not the credit union was listed as the creditor on the loan agreement and the security agreement, “the vehicle and [credit card] debts were not between the same parties” and the dragnet clause was not valid. Id. at 532. In Phillips, the debtor had granted a purchase money security interest in a mobile home to a credit union. 161 B.R. at 825. The security agreement for the mobile home contained a dragnet clause. Id. At the time of the bankruptcy petition, the debtor also had a credit card balance of $1,142.83 on a card issued by the same credit union. Id. Chief Judge Koger stated that “Missouri, perhaps because of its more commercial orientation and less debtor oriented background, has not engaged in such anti dragnet comments [as have some other states].” Id. at 826. Even so, in holding the dragnet clause enforceable, Chief Judge Koger went on to state that “This Court need not consider whether Missouri would apply the classification test because both the mobile home loan and the [credit card] account are consumer debts, secured by consumer goods, and can be classified as the ‘same class’ under the Johnson standard.” Id. at 827 (citing Third Nat’l Bank v. Johnson, 9 B.R. 713 (Bankr.M.D.Tenn.1981)).
