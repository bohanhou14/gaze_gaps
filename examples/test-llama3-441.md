MEMORANDUM DECISION ON NON-DISCHARGEABILITY CLAIMS
In these adversary proceedings, four limited partners of Belle Isle Limited Partnership ("BI") brought claims against the general partners, Edward LeRoux, Jr., Albert Curran, and Summit Investment and Development Corporation, seeking to establish that certain debts owed to them are non-dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523.

The debtors, LeRoux and Curran, argue that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations and that the plaintiffs have not established the necessary intent to deceive. However, the court finds that the allegations of fraud are sufficient to establish the necessary intent to deceive, citing In re Jackson, 89 B.R. 308 (Bankr.D.Mass.1988). Furthermore, the court accepts as true all well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, including the allegations of fraud and the intent to deceive. See Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984).

The court also finds that the plaintiffs have established that the debts were obtained by false pretenses, false representations, or actual fraud, as required by 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(2)(A). Specifically, the court finds that the defendants' representations in the offering memorandum and supplement were false, and that the plaintiffs relied on these representations to their detriment. See In re Roberts, 82 B.R. 179, 184 (Bankr.D.Mass.1987).

Therefore, the court holds that the debts owed to the plaintiffs are non-dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(2)(A).

gold_text: Defendants assert that this claim cannot be maintained because Plaintiffs did not allege that Debtors’ alleged fraud involved moral turpitude or intentional wrong. In re Snyder, 101 B.R. 822, 835 (Bankr.D.Mass.1989); In re Jackson, 89 B.R. 308, 312 (Bankr.D.Mass.1988). They allege that the fact that Plaintiffs did not plead that partnership funds were intentionally misappropriated or used for an illegitimate purpose is fatal.
