In support of the judgment, it is pertinent to reference case law that reinforces the principles of bank liability when surrendering bills of lading contrary to instructions. In 184 F.2d 731, the court affirmed that the determination of attorney’s fees by the trial judge was not an abuse of discretion and highlighted the non-mandatory nature of statutory impositions of such fees. This rationale can be applied by analogy to the present case, where the discretionary actions of NBA in handling the bills of lading must be scrutinized for reasonable care.

Furthermore, the case underscores the importance of following statutory provisions and directives in collections and remittances. The wrongful delivery of bills of lading by NBA, as established by precedent, aligns with the established liability for conversion detailed in Zollman, Banks and Banking (§ 5504). The analogy drawn in the instructive remarks from 184 F.2d 731 elucidates the principles that wrongful surrender implicates a bank’s accountability, as seen in the Hibernia Bank & Trust Co. v. Bank of Topeka (C.A.5) 288 F. 41 decision.

Thus, adopting the precedents from 184 F.2d 731 and consistent case law, the court asserts NBA’s liability due to lack of ordinary care in the misguided release of documents against express instructions, affirming the awarded judgment and costs.

gold_text: The plaintiff prays for interest on the amount of the judgment from June 1, 1960. The allowance of interest prior to judgment in diversity cases is governed by state law. The interest statute of Alaska provides that the rate of interest shall be six per cent per annum on moneys after the same become due and upon moneys due upon a settlement of matured accounts from the date the balance is ascertained. But such interest may not be allowed on unliquidated claims; and it is further held that interest may not be allowed where liability for the claim is not determined until the date of trial. Columbia Lbr. Co. v. Agostino, 9 Cir., 184 F.2d 731. Chirikoff Island Cattle Corp. v. Robinette, Alaska, 372 P.2d 791. Therefore interest may not be allowed except after judgment.
