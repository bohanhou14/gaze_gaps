In assessing the procedural issues, it is imperative to underline the dual function of the defendant's answer as seen in Berkey Technical Corp. v. United States, 71 Cust. Ct. 275, 380 F. Supp. 786 (1973). The purpose of pleadings, as clearly outlined, is to narrow the issue and focus on matters in controversy (71 Cust. Ct. 275). As such, the Customs Court exercises its discretion prudently to expedite the trial process and maintain procedural simplicity (77 Cust. Ct. 92, 380 F. Supp. 786).

With respect to answering allegations in broad terms, it is acknowledged that a general denial can suffice if the complaint itself is drafted in general terms (71 Cust. Ct. 275, 380 F. Supp. 786). The significant point here is the obligation of the defendant to make its answer precise only to the degree required by the specificity of the complaint (424 F. Supp. 112).

The pivotal aspect overlooked by the appellant in this case is the necessity of addressing evidentiary considerations directly in the pleadings rather than raising them post-trial, a principle reinforced in analogous cases (77 Cust. Ct. 92; 380 F. Supp. 786). Consequently, these principles support the court’s dismissal of the appellant’s late procedural and constitutional contentions for being outside the pleadings framework.
