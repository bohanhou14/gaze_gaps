The petitioners argue that their conduct is protected under the Petition Clause in a manner similar to the protections offered in Scientology of California v. Cazares, 707 F.2d 1020. However, in that case, the discussion focused on the broader freedom of expression without a direct conflict of interest like in the present case. Furthermore, petitioners' reliance on Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, and United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, is misplaced. The Supreme Court in these cases was concerned with efforts to influence governmental action, not self-interested negotiations under a fiduciary duty to the public. Unlike the political misrepresentations allowed in 404 U.S. 508, the petitioners' actions were not permissible "political expression" but a misuse of their official roles to secure personal benefits, which is prohibited by Illinois conflict-of-interest laws. Thus, their First Amendment claims fail to override the compelling state interest in preventing official misconduct and ensuring the integrity of public office.

gold_text: As noted, the First Amendment right to petition the courts is not absolute: it does not extend a right to use the courts for fraudulent or unlawful purposes. As the Ninth Circuit noted in Mayer v. Wedgewood Neighborhood Coalition, 707 F.2d 1020, 1023 (9th Cir.1983): “While normally protected by the first amendment, the invocation of administrative or judicial proceedings may be tortious and actionable if employed for a purpose that is unlawful and is other than and in addition to the goal sought openly in the proceeding itself.” Believing their situation within an exception to this rule, petitioners draw analogy to corporations that petition courts for anti-competitive purposes and are excepted from the operation of the antitrust laws under the doctrine set forth by the Supíneme Court in Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr, 365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d 464 (1961), and United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S.Ct. 1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965). However, as the Supreme Court made clear in California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 92 S.Ct. 609, 30 L.Ed.2d 642 (1972), the Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not exempt from the antitrust laws fraudulent appeals to judicial, administrative, or legislative bodies. The petitioners in California Motor Transport instituted state and federal proceedings to resist and defeat applications by competitors in the trucking business to acquire operating rights or to transfer or register those rights. 404 U.S. at 509, 92 S.Ct. at 611. In defense of antitrust claims, they appealed to the shelter of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. The Supreme Court rejected this appeal on the ground that Noerr-Pennington does not protect fraudulent or “sham” litigation:
