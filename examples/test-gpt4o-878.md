The Court must determine whether the obligations in question were intended as support or constituted a property settlement. In reference to the case (381 F.2d 168), it is established that payments designated as property settlements can still be treated as alimony if there is default, highlighting the importance of examining the underlying intentions and circumstances. Similarly, in case (8 B.R. 428), the substance of the obligation is paramount over its label, allowing the Court to consider the realities of support needs versus property distribution.

In this context, while the Debtor argues that home-related expenses and car payments are purely part of a property settlement, the Court must consider whether these obligations were intended to provide necessary support for the Defendant and the children. The Defendant’s limited income and the Debtor’s former role as the primary earner indicate that such support is necessary. Consequently, if these obligations are deemed necessary for the basic livelihood and maintenance of the former spouse and children, they should not be discharged in bankruptcy under § 523(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code.

Thus, the evidence compels a conclusion that the maintenance obligations for the marital home and the car payments are in the nature of support. As such, the Debtor’s obligations cannot be discharged and will persist despite the bankruptcy filing.

gold_text: The provision of the Code excepting from the overall protective provision of the general discharge obligation for alimony, maintenance or support of a wife or children continues the historical approach which always afforded to spouses or children some form of protection against future adversities which they face when the family unit is destroyed. The public policy behind this approach is clear and is based on the proposition that the former spouse rather than society should be responsible for the maintenance and support of members of the family unit which is destroyed through divorce. Factors which may be considered to characterize payments provided for in a divorce decree for purposes of determining dischargeability include whether the obligation terminates on the death or remarriage of the recipient or donor spouse, Adler v. Nicholas, 381 F.2d 168 (5th Cir. 1967); whether the payment appears to balance disparate incomes, In re Walder, 2 BCD 1205 (W.D.Wise.1976), In re Massimini, 8 B.R. 428 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Penn.1981); whether the obligation is payable in installments over a substantial period of time, In re Smith, 436 F.Supp. 469 (N.D.Ga.1977) and whether there are children who must be supported, In re Woods, 3 BCD 750 (7th Cir. 1977).
