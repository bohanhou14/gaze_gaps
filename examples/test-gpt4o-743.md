we are bound to follow the established legal principles regarding damages stemming from breach of contract. Specifically, the concept of proximate cause and reasonable foreseeability dictates that the Defendant is liable for only those damages that were reasonably foreseeable and proximately caused by their breach of the agreement. As correctly noted in 101 B.R. 856, such damages need not be proven with mathematical precision but must demonstrate a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.

In the case at hand, the Plaintiffs have failed to present sufficiently detailed and precise evidence to establish damages related to the lost profits from the new business with certainty. Therefore, while there is a clear entitlement to the advance of the second $50,000 under the contract terms, the broader claim for consequential damages totaling $331,121.33 lacks a sufficient evidentiary foundation. This is consistent with the findings in cases like 96 B.R. 507, where the necessity for showing proximate cause was emphasized.

Consequently, the Plaintiffs’ remedy is limited to specific performance requiring the Defendants to remit the remaining $50,000, with an additional $5,000 per week penalty for delayed remittance, aligning with the principles outlined in related case law.
