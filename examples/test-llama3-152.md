In the case at hand, the court must consider whether the state's failure to disclose the identity of an informant and the failure to disclose bargains made for the testimony of two witnesses violated the petitioner's fifth and fourteenth amendment rights. The court notes that the United States Supreme Court has held that "the federal habeas remedy extends to state prisoners alleging that unconstitutionally obtained evidence was admitted against them at trial" (Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217 (1969)). The court also notes that the Supreme Court has held that "the exclusion of illegally seized evidence is simply a prophylactic device intended generally to deter Fourth Amendment violations by law enforcement officers" (Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465 (1976)).

The court finds that the state's failure to disclose the identity of an informant did not violate the petitioner's fifth and fourteenth amendment rights. The court notes that the petitioner failed to show that the informant's identity was material to his defense (Horton v. United States, 609 F.2d 216 (1980)). The court also notes that the state's failure to disclose bargains made for the testimony of two witnesses did not violate the petitioner's fifth and fourteenth amendment rights. The court finds that the petitioner failed to show that the bargains were material to his defense (Horton v. United States, 609 F.2d 216 (1980)).

In conclusion, the court finds that the state's failure to disclose the identity of an informant and the failure to disclose bargains made for the testimony of two witnesses did not violate the petitioner's fifth and fourteenth amendment rights. The court affirms the denial of habeas corpus relief.

gold_text: The Magistrate did not review any claims made by petitioner in regard to the allegedly illegal search of the car incident to his arrest which culminated in the introduction of the two pistols into evidence at the trial. Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976) bars review of the petitioner’s Fourth Amendment claims. The Court finds that the petitioner had opportunities for full and fair litigation of his Fourth Amendment challenges in the state court proceedings, thus this Court is barred from re-examining these claims in a habeas corpus proceeding. See, Williams v. Brown, 609 F.2d 216, 218 (5th Cir. 1980). Petitioner’s assertion that Stone v. Powell was wrongly decided in no way alters this Court’s views on its applicability to this case. Therefore the search and seizure claims of petitioner may not form a basis for a grant of the writ of habeas corpus.
