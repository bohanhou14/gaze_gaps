The case at hand, Memorandum Opinion, presents a motion for relief from the automatic stay filed by Movant Capitol City Savings Association under the disjunctive provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 362(d)(1) and (2). The Debtor, Playa Development Corporation, argues that its legal claims against Movant should be considered by the court in its discretion to refuse relief and that granting relief would amount to a violation of the absolute priority rule.

The court has previously held that the burden of proof is on the Debtor to show that the property is necessary for an effective reorganization, and that the Debtor must demonstrate a reasonable possibility that a successful rehabilitation or liquidation can be accomplished within a reasonable period of time and that the property in question will contribute to this effect (In re Koopmans, 22 B.R. 395, 398). The court has also held that reorganization embraces both rehabilitation and liquidation efforts and that under § 362(d)(2)(B), property may be necessary either to an “effective rehabilitation” or to an “effective liquidation” (In re Terra Mar Associates, 3 B.R. 462, 466).

In this case, the court finds that the Debtor has not met its burden of proof to show that the property is necessary for an effective reorganization. The evidence presented by the Debtor is conclusory and lacks specificity, and the court is left to speculate as to the likelihood of a successful reorganization (In re Dublin Properties, 12 B.R. 77). The court also notes that the Debtor has not presented any evidence to support its claims that the property will contribute to the success of its reorganization efforts (In re Jug End in the Berkshires, Inc., 46 B.R. 892).

In conclusion, the court finds that the Debtor has not met its burden of proof to show that the property is necessary for an effective reorganization, and therefore grants the motion for relief from the automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. § 362(d)(2) (In re Shriver, 33 B.R. 176).

gold_text: 3.23 The Debtor in this case has also at least alluded to the idea that the Movant cannot do more with the subject properties than is now being done or attempted to be done by the Debtor. This Court is not aware of any requirement that the creditor explain what it intends to do with the property if it is successful in vacating the stay. The mere fact that a secured creditor would do nothing more than Debtor with the property does not mean Debtor should be allowed to keep the property. In re Greiman, 45 B.R. 574, 583 (Bankr.N.D. Iowa 1984), citing In re BBT, 11 B.R. 224, 230 (Bankr.Nev.1981).
