After reviewing the case, it appears that the state court's decision to strike Hansbrough's notice of appeal does not constitute an independent and adequate state procedural rule. The court's action was not firmly established and regularly followed, as there is no Alabama rule or law that a voluntary dismissal of an appeal is with prejudice so as to bar a subsequent appeal. Additionally, there is no Alabama case holding that post-trial motions have no tolling effect if a notice of appeal has already been filed when the motions are denied.

As stated in Barr v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 146, 149 (1964), "state procedural rules 'not strictly or regularly followed' may not bar our review." The Supreme Court has also held that a state court's application of its decision in Sparks to the case before us does not even remotely satisfy the requirement of James that an adequate and independent state procedural bar to the entertainment of constitutional claims must have been "firmly established and regularly followed." See 466 U.S. 341 (1984).

Furthermore, the state court's decision to strike Hansbrough's notice of appeal was not a "plain statement" of why the appeal was stricken, as required by Harmon v. Barton, 894 F.2d 1268, 1271 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 832, 111 S.Ct. 96, 112 L.Ed.2d 68 (1990). Therefore, federal review of Hansbrough's claim is not barred, and the court should address the claim.

In conclusion, the state court's decision to strike Hansbrough's notice of appeal does not constitute an independent and adequate state procedural rule, and federal review of his claim is not barred. The court should therefore address the merits of Hansbrough's habeas petition.
