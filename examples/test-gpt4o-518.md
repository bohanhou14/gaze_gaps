**Generation:**

Engler’s failure to address the procedural due-process claim in response to Arnold’s motion effectively waives the argument. As articulated in prior cases, “[i]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived” (125 F.3d 989, 995-96). This principle has consistently been upheld, as exemplified in cases such as Wilson v. First Houston Inv. Corp., where the failure to substantiate arguments was deemed a waiver (759 F.3d 601). Because Engler did not develop this claim in his response, we decline to address it further. Thus, we affirm the district court’s dismissal.

For the reasons stated, including the lack of sufficient factual details and waived arguments, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment in favor of Arnold.
