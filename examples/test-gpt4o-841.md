In 846 F.2d 448, the court clarified that an employer must explain its actions when a protected employee is released, especially if younger employees are retained. This aligns with Oxman's case, where it was necessary for the employer to justify its non-discriminatory reasons adequately.

Similarly, in 769 F.2d 1215, the court noted that statistics alone are insufficient to establish age discrimination unless the discrepancies are substantial. Here, it was emphasized that decisions based on legitimate economic factors do not automatically indicate age discrimination. Matthews, in that case, failed to demonstrate that his termination was directly caused by age bias, which parallels our scenario where Montgomery Ward's reorganization was cited as the reason for Casbier's termination.

In light of these precedents, revisiting the summary judgment against Casbier is justified. The initial ruling overlooked the genuine availability of positions and the legal obligation to address the age discrimination claim comprehensively. Therefore, a detailed examination considering the legal updates and factual corrections is warranted.

Thus, the reconsideration of the judgment against Casbier should proceed, as the summary judgment appears to have rested on an incomplete assessment, inconsistent with the principles outlined in 846 F.2d 448 and 769 F.2d 1215.
