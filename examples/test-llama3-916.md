The provided references are legal cases that discuss the concept of mistake of fact in the context of military law. In case 10 U.S.C.M.A. 122, the court held that the accused was not entitled to an instruction on mistake of fact because he did not claim a mistake with regard to the victim's consent. Instead, he vigorously asserted that the victim had consented to the act.

In case 27 C.M.R. 196, the court found that the accused was acquitted of the charge in connection with which the requested instruction was given, and therefore, any possibility of prejudice was dispelled.

Case 8 M.J. 598 discusses the concept of mistake of fact in the context of rape. The court held that the evidence presented in the case did not support the accused's contention that the victim impliedly consented to his advances. The court also found that the accused did not request an instruction on mistake of fact and therefore, was not entitled to one.

In conclusion, the provided references demonstrate that the concept of mistake of fact is relevant in the context of military law, particularly in cases involving allegations of rape. However, the accused must establish a mistake with regard to the victim's consent in order to be entitled to an instruction on mistake of fact.

gold_text: In a supplemental assignment of error the defense contends the government failed to establish that the prosecutrix was not the wife of the accused. The non-marital status between the victim and the accused at the time of the act is an essential element of rape. United States v. Williams, 40 C.M.R. 521 (A.B.R.1969). Penetration and the accusedâ€™s identity are also essential elements that may be established by circumstantial evidence. United States v. Stephens, 14 C.M.R. 321 (A.B.R.1954); United States v. Hunter, 6 C.M.R. 349 (1954). Further, that standard of proof in a circumstantial evidence case is no higher than one proved by direct evidence. United States v. Jones, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 122, 27 C.M.R. 196 (C.M.A.1959). While there is no direct testimony that the accused and the prosecutrix were not husband and wife, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence that they were not. Thus, we find that this element of the offense is established beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Guilford, 8 M.J. 598 (A.C.M.R.1979); See also State v. Twyford, 186 N.W.2d 545, 85 S.D. 522 (1971).
