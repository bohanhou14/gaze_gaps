In reviewing the Plan Administrator's decision, we must consider whether the Administrator's interpretation of the plan was legally correct and whether the Administrator abused its discretion. Referring to Wildbur v. ARCO Chemical Co., 974 F.2d 631, 637-638 (citations omitted), we note that a court must determine the legally correct interpretation of the plan. If the Administrator did not give the plan the legally correct interpretation, the court must then determine whether the Administrator's decision was an abuse of discretion.

In this case, the Plan Administrator, Newman, determined that Elizabeth's accident occurred while she was traveling to work, thus excluding it from coverage under the Plan. The district court concluded that Newman's decision was legally incorrect and an abuse of discretion. However, upon reviewing the case, we find that Newman's interpretation of the plan was reasonable and not an abuse of discretion.

The Plan explicitly excludes coverage for injuries sustained during travel to and from work, and Elizabeth's job description required her to be available at all hours, including evenings and weekends. While Elizabeth was responding to an alarm at the store, this was part of her regular job duties, and not a deviation from her normal commute. Thus, we find that Newman's decision to deny coverage was not an abuse of discretion.

In contrast, the cases cited by the district court, such as Duffer v. American Home Assurance Co., are distinguishable because they involved policies with limiting language, such as "commutation" or "everyday," which was not present in the Plan at issue here. Therefore, we reverse the district court and render judgment in favor of the defendants, finding that Newman's decision to deny coverage was not an abuse of discretion.
