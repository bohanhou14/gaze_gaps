We are left, therefore, to scrutinize whether the broader interpretation of the statute, as urged by the prosecution, holds under the prevailing legal standards. Pertinent to this discussion is the principle elucidated in United States v. Eaton, 144 U. S. 677, 687, 12 Sup. Ct. 764, 36 L. Ed. 591, where it was stated that administrative regulations cannot prescribe a criminal offense unless explicitly authorized by statute. This principle is reinforced by Todd v. United States, 158 U. S. 278, 282, 15 Sup. Ct. 889, 39 L. Ed. 982, emphasizing that criminal statutes cannot be extended by intendment.

Further, in Hadden v. The Collector, 5 Wall. 107, 111, 18 L. Ed. 518, it was noted that adjudicating based on governmental policy can lead to subjective interpretations, which is not a solid foundation for judicial decisions. We must also consider Smith v. Townsend, 148 U. S. 490, 497, 13 Sup. Ct. 634, 37 L. Ed. 533, which mandates a strict construction of penal statutes. Similarly, France v. United States, 164 U. S. 676, 17 Sup. Ct. 219, 41 L. Ed. 595, underscores that convictions must be grounded in clear statutory language rather than judicial interpretation.

In conclusion, referencing 26 L. Ed. 187 and 34 L. Ed. 1054, where the judgments were affirmed under clear statutory contexts and existing legal principles addressing fraud, it is evident that the indictment's second count cannot be sustained under section 4746, unless it clearly aligns with its statutory intent limited to pension matters. Therefore, the second count is quashed.

gold_text: We come then to consider how we shall understand the section in this particular: “pertaining to any other matter within the jurisdiction * * * of the Secretary of the Interior.” The indictment charges that the false filings, declarations, affidavits, certificates, papers, and writings used in each particular entry was a matter and proceeding before the register and receiver within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior. The register and receiver are not subordinate officers to the Secretary, in the sense that they act for him and perform duties incumbent on him. They are not his agents. They hold office under appointment by the President. They discharge duties fixed on them by statute. Their findings in some cases are final; in others there is a right of appeal to the Commissioner of the Band Office and from his rulings to the Secretary. What is meant by “jurisdiction” as here used? Its prime conception is one of power. When used in a political sense, it means governmental authority; such as when we say, the federal government has jurisdiction over navigable waters and interstate commerce, such as when we say,, a state has jurisdiction over affairs purely local. The section does not use the phrase “within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior” in that sense. That would smack too much of that imperialism, when the spirit of the Caesars brooded over a vast -empire, from whose capital city an impending hand reached out to its remotest confines. The word “jurisdiction,” must be here used in its legal sense, meaning authority to hear and determine a cause. Daniels v. Tearney, 102 U. S. 415, 418, 26 L. Ed. 187; Simmons v. Saul, 138 U. S. 439, 454, 11 Sup. Ct. 369, 34 L. Ed. 1054. But in determining whether the Secretary had authority to hear and determine the matters charged to have been presented to the register and receiver, other statutes must be considered. He could not of his own motion take the matter then pending in the local land office to himself for decision. It could only reach him, if at all, by a process of appeal, as provided by statute. It is not charged that the matter was appealed to him. Indeed, it was tacitly admitted in argument that the matters progressed no further than where they were first lodged in the local land office with the register and receiver. In no event is jurisdiction acquired by a court or officer on whom the law confers the power, until the power so given is exercised or invoked by an interested party. To hold that the Secretary had jurisdiction of the matters charged in the indictment would be to liken jurisdiction in its legal sense to jurisdiction in its political sense, which cannot be done under this statute. I think it clearly appears that the matters charged in the indictment were not within the jurisdiction of the Secretary as contemplated in section 4746.
