In this case, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not adequately demonstrated that Dr. Adler's actions rise to the level of deliberate indifference required to sustain a constitutional claim under § 1983. As explicated in relevant case law, negligence and carelessness do not equate to the requisite state of mind for such claims (511 U.S. 825). The standard necessitates a showing of conduct that exhibits deliberate indifference to a serious medical need, characterized by a mental state akin to criminal recklessness (111 F.3d 1364). Given that Plaintiff alleges Dr. Adler was distracted and inadvertently failed to order the prescription refill, this reflects a lapse that, while possibly negligent, does not meet the threshold of "deliberate indifference" as set forth by the applicable legal standards. Consequently, Defendant’s Motion To Dismiss is granted with respect to Dr. Adler.

gold_text: In his Opposition to Defendants’ Motion, Plaintiff cites three cases. (See Opp. at unnumbered 3.) However, none of these cases suggests a different result, and two of the cases actually support Defendants’ Motion. First, Plaintiff cites Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), in which the Supreme Court outlined the prevailing legal standard for the deliberate indifference analysis. See id. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970 (deliberate indifference requires that a prison official must “know[] of and disregard^ an excessive risk to inmate health or safety” and “must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and ... must also draw the inference”). However, the Court has applied the Farmer standard for deliberate indifference in this case, and because the plaintiff in Farmer did not allege inadequate medical care, the case is not otherwise relevant. Plaintiff cites two other cases in which the plaintiffs claimed inadequate medical care, but in both of those eases, the courts dismissed the claims after finding that the plaintiffs did not satisfy the subjective prong. See Gutierrez v. Peters, 111 F.3d 1364, 1374 (7th Cir.1997) (dismissing a claim where the prison doctor’s incorrect diagnosis resulted in a two-week delay in treatment, but plaintiff was “promptly and comprehensively treated” once the mistake was corrected); Crayton v. Quarterman, No. 08-CV68, 2009 WL 3740650, at *4 (N.D.Tex. Nov. 6, 2009) (dismissing claim where prison officials allegedly exacerbated plaintiffs injuries by ignoring his medical condition, but plaintiff ultimately received “prompt and appropriate attention”). Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants’ Motion To Dismiss Plaintiffs § 1983 claims without prejudice.
