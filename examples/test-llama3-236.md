In this case, we see that the defendants have moved for summary judgment or vacatur of the preliminary injunction, claiming that the plaintiff's claims are moot. However, the court finds that the defendants' voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not make the case moot (W.T. Grant Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897 (1953)).

Furthermore, the court notes that even if the defendants have abandoned the tender offer, they still hold Fund stock in violation of § 12(d)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (S.E.C. v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946)). Additionally, the court finds that there are still factual issues to be resolved regarding the completeness of the defendants' retreat from the tender offer and whether an agreement or understanding is in place between the defendants regarding the disposition of their Fund shares (S.E.C. v. Joiner Corp., 421 U.S. 837, 95 S.Ct. 1960, 44 L.Ed.2d 331 (1975)).

In conclusion, the court denies the defendants' motions for summary judgment and vacatur of the preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiff's claims are still viable and that there are factual issues to be resolved (Clemente Global Growth Fund, Inc. v. Pickens, 705 F.Supp. 958, 967-69 (S.D.N.Y.1989)).

gold_text: The Grace Global defendants have embraced the question raised by the SEC and elevated it to a legal conclusion. They contend that Grace Global, like GPGAP before it (and the organized investment group before GPGAP), does not issue securities and therefore cannot, as a matter of law, be an investment company. As the SEC observed in its brief, general partnership interests “usually are not securities, but may be under certain factual circumstances.” SEC Brief at 14 (emphasis in original). A general partnership interest may be deemed a security when “the partnership interest ... satisfies] the Howey test.” Hirsch v. duPont, 396 F.Supp. 1214, 1220 (S.D.N.Y.1975), aff'd, 553 F.2d 750 (2d Cir.1977). In SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946), the Supreme Court, in defining “investment contracts” for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, stated: “[t]he test is whether the scheme involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.” Id. at 301, 66 S.Ct. at 1104. In a later exposition of the subject, the Supreme Court observed: “[t]he touchstone [of Howey ] is the presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” United Housing Found., Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 852, 95 S.Ct. 2051, 2060, 44 L.Ed.2d 621 (1975). If a triable issue exists regarding whether any putative general partnership interest in Grace Global derives its profits through the endeavors of others, summary judgment may not be employed.
