The reference cases mentioned in the write-up are crucial in understanding the legal context of the appeal. In the case 53 F.3d 398, the court departed downward from the Sentencing Guidelines due to the defendant's criminality. The court used the three-pronged test to justify the departure: whether the reason for departing was lawfully grounded, whether the finding was sustainable on whole-record review, and whether the degree of the departure was reasonable. Similarly, in the case 874 F.2d 43, the court departed downward from the Sentencing Guidelines due to the defendant's role in the offense.

In the present case, the court considered the Departure Guidelines and the Environmental Offense Guideline to determine the appropriate sentence for the defendant. The court noted that the Departure Guidelines provide for a departure when the offense is atypical, and the Environmental Offense Guideline provides for a base offense level of 6. The court also considered the tax loss table, which was used to calculate the excise tax loss.

The court concluded that the defendant's sentence should be vacated and remanded for re-sentencing. The court noted that the district judge had departed downward from the Sentencing Guidelines, but the departure was not justified. The court also noted that the tax loss table was not applicable in this case, as the defendant did not intend to evade taxes.

Overall, the reference cases provided important guidance for the court in determining the appropriate sentence for the defendant. The court considered the Departure Guidelines, the Environmental Offense Guideline, and the tax loss table to determine the appropriate sentence, and ultimately vacated the defendant's sentence and remanded for re-sentencing.
