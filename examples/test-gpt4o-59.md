**Generation:**

Our conclusion is reinforced by precedent cases. In Afro-American Publishing Co. v. Jaffe, the court held that defamatory content must be construed in the manner that the average reader would understand it (278 F.2d 23). In this case, the defamatory nature of Lowery’s letter is evident, as it questions appellant’s professional and personal integrity within his community. Furthermore, as underscored in the case at 132 F.2d 734, even expressions of unfavorable opinions, when stated as fact, can meet the criteria of defamation if they imply false factual assertions. Here, the allegations about appellant’s refusal to sell the house and failure to make payments, even when attributed to Mrs. Olinger, are susceptible to defamatory interpretation. These statements necessitate factual verification, placing them squarely within the jury’s purview. Therefore, the issues at hand demand further judicial examination to ascertain both the factual accuracy and the defamatory impact of the published letter.

So ordered.
