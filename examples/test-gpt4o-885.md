Mandell asserts that his claim for attorney’s fees should be considered an allowable expense under PACA trust principles. Nonetheless, PACA does not provide explicit authorization for such an expense. Reference case 222 F.3d 132 emphasizes that the primary purpose of PACA is to protect sellers of perishable agricultural commodities by ensuring full payment (Idahoan Fresh v. Advantage Produce, Inc., 157 F.3d 197, 199 (3d Cir.1998)). Likewise, in reference case 165 F.3d 1, the court identified that PACA trust protections are strictly construed to benefit unpaid sellers, and deviations for delayed payments outside the statutory limit were not permissible. Therefore, permitting attorney’s fees out of PACA trust assets could impair the statutory protection intended solely for sellers.

Further, reference case 132 B.R. 632 underscores that the PACA trust’s purpose is to prioritize unpaid suppliers over other creditors, noting that any financing arrangements that divert trust assets are contrary to the public interest (7 U.S.C.S. § 499e(c)(1)). The trust must protect these assets until full payment is rendered to the sellers. Thus, using the trust assets to pay Mandell's fees would conflict with the stringent requirements set forth under PACA.

Conclusively, even though ordinary principles of trust law might allow a trustee to incur necessary expenses, the language and purpose of PACA do not support the allocation of trust assets for attorney’s fees. Thus, the ruling of Magistrate Judge Peck that Mandell’s lien is unenforceable should be affirmed.

gold_text: Courts have recognized that the intent of Congress in enacting PACA’s trust provision was to provide unpaid produce sellers with greater protection from the risk of default by buyers. Endico Potatoes, 67 F.3d at 1067; In re Kornblum, 81 F.3d at 283 (Congress enacted the trust provision “to broaden the protections afforded to produce suppliers”). See also Tanimura & Antle, Inc. v. Packed Fresh Produce, Inc., 222 F.3d 132, 135-136 (3rd Cir.2000); Hiller Cranberry Products, Inc. v. Koplovsky, 165 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1999); In re Southland + Keystone, 132 B.R. 632, 639 (9th Cir. BAP, 1991) (PACA “was established by Congress to protect sellers and suppliers of perishable agricultural commodities until full payment of sums due have been reeeived”)(internal quotations omitted). Allowing a defunct PACA trustee to pay other creditors with PACA funds before the seller is paid in full would frustrate this purpose, and would be contrary to the language of PACA and its accompanying regulations. PACA trust beneficiaries are entitled to full payment before trustees may lawfully use trust funds to pay other creditors.
