The equal protection challenges brought by Sweet and Henderson against the Oregon forcible rape statute must be viewed in the context of relevant case law. Notably, State v. Elmore, 24 Or.App. 651, 546 P.2d 1117 (1976) dismissed an equal protection challenge by applying minimal scrutiny, which has since been superseded by the intermediate scrutiny standard in Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 97 S.Ct. 451 (1976). This shift underscores that gender-based classifications must serve important governmental objectives and be substantially related to achieving those objectives.

The hallmark case Michael M. v. Superior Court, 25 Cal.3d 608, 601 P.2d 572 (1979), affirms that gender-based statutory regulations surrounding sexual offenses can withstand intermediate scrutiny, provided they meet the requisite legal thresholds (ref. 625 F.2d 216). Similarly, State v. Rundlett, 391 A.2d 815, 822 (Me. 1978), upheld different penalties for male offenders against females, aligning with established judicial practices against claims of sex discrimination (ref. 607 F.2d 495).

Additionally, the rejection of statistical and societal assumptions about gender roles in People v. Mackey, 46 Cal.App.3d 755, 120 Cal.Rptr. 157 (1975), casts doubt on the efficacy of older reasoning that favored minimal scrutiny (ref. 564 F.2d 602).

Despite these precedents, Sweet and Henderson must exhaust state remedies as mandated by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b). The court affirms that exhaustion requirements are not dispensable, recognizing the state's role in initially addressing constitutional challenges to its statutes. Accordingly, Sweet and Henderson’s petitions remain procedurally premature.

gold_text: . Subsequent to State v. Elmore, those courts which have applied the standard enunciated in Craig to gender-based statutory rape provisions have reached contrary results. Compare United States v. Hicks, 625 F.2d 216 (9th Cir. 1980) and Meloon v. Helgemoe, 564 F.2d 602 (1st Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 950, 98 S.Ct. 2858, 56 L.Ed.2d 793 (1978), with Rundlett v. Oliver, 607 F.2d 495 (1st Cir. 1979) and State v. Gray, 122 Ariz. 445, 595 P.2d 990 (1979). We note that the Supreme Court has recently granted certiorari in a case in which a state statutory rape provision was upheld by a 4 to 3 vote of the California Supreme Court. Michael M. v. Superior Court, 25 Cal.3d 608, 601 P.2d 572, 159 Cal.Rptr. 340 (1979), cert. granted, 447 U.S. 904, 100 S.Ct. 2984, 64 L.Ed.2d 853 (1980).
