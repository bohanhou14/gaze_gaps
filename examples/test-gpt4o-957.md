Plaintiff's argument that the unsafe and deteriorating conditions of the shower area created a sufficient basis for a ยง 1983 claim does not hold. In *Baker v. McCollan*, the Supreme Court (443 U.S. 137, 99 S. Ct. 2689) clarified that the negligence of officials leading to unintended harm does not constitute a constitutional violation. Specifically, the Court stated that "the Due Process Clause is simply not implicated by a negligent act of an official causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property." This precedent underscores that actions arising from mere negligence, such as failure to repair, do not meet the threshold for a Fourteenth Amendment violation.

Moreover, the presence of slippery floors in prisons has been repeatedly deemed insufficient to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. As discussed in *Davis v. Superintendent Somerset SCI*, similar slip-and-fall claims have been considered under negligence rather than constitutional violations, reiterating that ยง 1983 is not a mechanism to address ordinary negligence claims.

Given these precedents, Plaintiff's allegations regarding the conditions of the shower area, including the presence of black mold, do not rise to a constitutional violation. The claims suggest, at most, negligence by prison officials, insufficient to state a ยง 1983 claim. Therefore, Plaintiff's claims under ยง 1983 are dismissed without prejudice, affirming that ordinary negligence claims should be pursued under state tort law.
