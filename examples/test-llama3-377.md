OPINION

In the case of United States v. Looney, No. 95-XXXXXXXX, the accused, Looney, was convicted of unpremeditated murder under Article 118(3) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The specification alleged that Looney murdered Private First Class (PFC) C by stabbing him in the chest with a knife. The military judge found Looney guilty, except for the words "by stabbing him in the chest with a knife," substituting the words "by engaging in an act inherently dangerous to another, to wit: stabbing PFC [C] in the chest area with a knife."

On appeal, Looney argued that the specification was insufficient to support his conviction because it did not identify the theory of unpremeditated murder that the government was proceeding under. Looney cited United States v. Russell, 47 M.J. 412 (1998), which held that a specification must provide sufficient notice of the offense charged to enable the accused to prepare a defense.

The court held that the specification was sufficient to provide notice of the offense charged because it alleged that Looney engaged in an act inherently dangerous to another, which is a necessary element of unpremeditated murder under Article 118(3). The court also noted that the language used in the specification was similar to that used in the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), which defines unpremeditated murder under Article 118(3) as an act "inherently dangerous to another" that shows "wanton disregard for human life."

The court also rejected Looney's argument that the military judge's findings were insufficient to support his conviction. The court held that the evidence presented at trial supported both the specific intent and wanton act theories of unpremeditated murder, and that the military judge's findings were sufficiently detailed to support the conviction.

In conclusion, the court held that the specification was sufficient to provide notice of the offense charged, and that the military judge's findings were sufficiently detailed to support the conviction. The court also rejected Looney's argument that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.
