The principle that transfers made within a three-year period before death are presumed to be in contemplation of death has been firmly established in judicial precedent (326 U.S. 630). The court in City Bank Farmers Trust Co. v. McGowan, 323 U. S. 594, 599, asserted that the "thought of death" must be the "impelling cause of the transfer.” Further, in United States v. Wells, 283 U. S. 102, it was established that contemplation of death encompasses motives similar to testamentary dispositions.

In the case of George F. Metzger, the gifts made were argued by the plaintiff to be motivated by the decedent's intention to support his children during his lifetime, rather than as a substitute for a testamentary disposition. The gifts to Herbert Metzger and Anna May Timmons appear to reflect lifetime objectives, such as fostering familial relationships and ensuring financial stability for newly married children, rather than being prompted by the decedent’s imminent death.

Additionally, the decedent’s behavior, health condition, and familial history support the lack of testamentary intent. George F. Metzger had no prior heart condition diagnosis and remained active until his death, further indicating the gifts were driven by living motives. This aligns with the principle elucidated in the reference case (326 U.S. 630) that the burden lies on the plaintiff to establish living motives, which, after reviewing the totality of facts, appears convincingly met.

Given the evidence, the conclusion stands that the gifts in question were driven by the decedent’s life-centric concerns, not contemplation of death, thus should not be included in the gross estate for tax purposes.
