4. Admissibility of Prior Criminal Acts in Entrapment Defense

The key issue here involves the permissible scope of rebuttal evidence once the defense of entrapment has been introduced. McClain argues that the court erred by admitting hearsay testimony regarding his predisposition to commit the offense. As established in reference case 198 F.2d 795, prior criminal acts can be admissible to show intent, general scheme, or predisposition when entrapment is raised. This principle aligns with the ruling in Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, where the court allowed the introduction of an accused's previous criminal acts to counter the entrapment defense.

Additionally, citing reference case 211 F.2d 513, predisposition and criminal design of the defendant are considered relevant. The court has consistently recognized that the defense of entrapment permits a searching inquiry into the defendant’s conduct and predisposition. Thus, prior criminal activities related to drugs are admissible to rebut McClain's entrapment claims.

In light of these precedents, the trial court did not err in admitting testimony that indicated McClain’s predisposition, which included past conduct and statements that he was a good outlet for cocaine. This evidence was crucial in responding to McClain’s entrapment defense and aligns with established judicial practice.

gold_text: Our own decisions are not in very good array. In Carlton v. United States, 9 Cir., 1952, 198 F.2d 795, 797, we held that the defendant’s “record of previous convictions of similar or related criminal offenses, both misdemeanors and felonies ” are admissible as “rebuttal evidence after the defendant has introduced a defense of entrapment.” (p. 797; emphasis in original.) Trice v. United States, 9 Cir., 1954, 211 F.2d 513, is similar to Washington v. United States, supra, in holding that hearsay evidence that Trice was an opium dealer was admissible, not to prove the truth of the hearsay, but to prove the good faith of the government agent. (211 F.2d at 516-518) It bears emphasizing that defense counsel in Trice did not object. This is not a holding that such evidence is admissible to prove Trice's predisposition.
