In evaluating the validity of the detectives' actions under the Fourth Amendment, it is imperative to consider the precedent set forth in United States v. Watson (423 U.S. 411) regarding warrantless searches and the reasonable grounds required for such actions. The Court in Watson held that warrantless searches are permissible if they are conducted under the authority of a statute that provides reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a felony. In this case, Tate's suspicious activity, coupled with his interaction with known narcotics dealers in a high-narcotics activity area, provided sufficient grounds for the detectives to conduct an investigatory stop.

Additionally, the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Robinson (414 U.S. 218) justifies a search incident to a lawful arrest, emphasizing the need to disarm the suspect and preserve evidence. When Tate and his companion were found in possession of a stolen vehicle, the arrest was lawful, and the ensuing search was incidental to that arrest.

Furthermore, parallels can be drawn to the scenario in United States v. Sifuentes (504 F.2d 845). In Sifuentes, officers were justified in conducting an inventory search based on departmental regulations. Similarly, in Tate's case, departmental procedures to check the vehicle's registration due to the circumstances met the criteria for a lawful investigatory stop.

Therefore, considering Watson's warrantless search doctrine, Robinson's search incident to arrest, and the regulatory compliance seen in Sifuentes, the detectives' actions in stopping and subsequently arresting Tate were constitutionally sound under the Fourth Amendment.

gold_text: There can be no question that the detectives had probable cause to arrest the defendant when the response to their request for a license check reported that the Monte Carlo was listed as stolen. There was no need for a warrant since the detectives arrested the defendant for a felony in a public place. United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 418, 423-24, 96 S.Ct. 820, 825, 827-28, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976). Therefore, the search of the defendantâ€™s person incident to the arrest was reasonable. United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 472, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). Likewise, the seizure of evidence from the Monte Carlo was proper because the items seized were in plain view. United States v. Sifuentes, 504 F.2d 845, 848-49 (4th Cir. 1974).
