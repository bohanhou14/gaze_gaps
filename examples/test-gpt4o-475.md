The concept of "firm resettlement" plays a critical role in determining eligibility for asylum. According to 8 C.F.R. § 208.15 and cited in 162 F.3d 1227, an alien is considered firmly resettled if they received an offer of permanent resident status, citizenship, or another form of permanent resettlement in a third country prior to arriving in the United States. This principle is echoed in the precedent cases mentioned, such as *Rosenberg v. Woo* (402 U.S. 49), where the Supreme Court emphasized that firm resettlement precludes an asylum claim unless exceptional circumstances exist.

In *Woo*, the Court found that asylum laws were intended to provide refuge for those without any safe haven, stressing that those who have found stable resettlement elsewhere do not meet this criterion (402 U.S. at 55-56). This notion was reaffirmed by the Ninth Circuit in *Yang v. INS*, which held that "Congress intended to give relief to individuals ‘subject to persecution in their homelands’," and that firm resettlement for aliens negates this intent (79 F.3d 932, 939).

Moreover, the Eighth Circuit in *Farbakhsh v. INS* (20 F.3d 877) reiterated that an alien’s brief, necessary stop in a country does not constitute firm resettlement unless it interrupts the flight from persecution and establishes meaningful ties. These precedents collectively support the Board’s decision in Ali’s case: her established life and legal status in Denmark denote firm resettlement, which precludes her asylum eligibility in the U.S.

Therefore, given the firm resettlement doctrine’s consistent application across cases and circuits, the Board's determination in Ali's situation is neither “manifestly contrary to law” nor an abuse of discretion.

Another country may have allowed only a temporary and not a permanent refuge. But where the duration and circumstances indicate that the asylum seeker may remain in the third country, then it is incumbent upon him to show the contrary.”); cf. Farbakhsh v.
