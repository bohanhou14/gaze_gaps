 <answer> Based on the provided references, it appears that the plaintiffs have framed their claim as a breach of contract, alleging that a written employment (re-enlistment) contract between the U.S. Air Force and Mr. Beauchamp was breached, resulting in $1,000,000 in damages. The plaintiffs contend that the defendant, the U.S. Air Force, failed to provide accurate information regarding mobile home space in California, which induced them to move their mobile home to an unsuitable location.

The court has jurisdiction over this claim under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1491, as it arises primarily from a contractual undertaking. The court finds that the alleged tortious conduct, consisting of the sponsor's provision of false and misleading information regarding mobile home space in California, establishes a definite connection between the alleged tortious conduct and the contractual obligation owed to Mr. Beauchamp by the Air Force.

However, the court holds that the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because the re-enlistment agreement did not contain any promises or representations regarding suitable mobile home space in California. The court notes that the plaintiffs' reliance on AFR 35-35, which provides for sponsorship and individualized assistance to incoming members, is misplaced, as this regulation does not mandate money damages.

In United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 2967-68, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983), the Supreme Court held that the Tucker Act does not create any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages. The court further notes that the absence of precedent supporting a claim for money damages arising from alleged breaches of enlistment agreements is indicative of the "peculiar nature" of enlistment agreements, which are governed by statutory rights rather than common law principles of contract law.

In Larionoff v. United States, 650 F.2d 264 (1981), the court held that money damages are not an available remedy for the government's breach of an enlistment contract, as authorization for money paid to soldiers must come directly from Congress or its duly authorized agency.

Based on the foregoing, the court concludes that the plaintiffs' claim is not sufficient to support a claim for money damages, and therefore, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted. <answer>
