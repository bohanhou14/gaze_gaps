The present case invokes critical jurisprudence established in prior rulings, notably Steele v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 323 U. S. 192, and Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, 323 U. S. 210. Both cases elucidate the Railway Labor Act's imposition on labor organizations to represent all employees in a craft, devoid of racial discrimination. Similarly, in 186 F.2d 473, it was found that contracts distinguishing between promotable and nonpromotable firemen adversely impacted Negro firemen, enforcing racial discrimination in promotion practices.

The history reveals that the Railroad's pre-Act racial segregation and discrimination in terms of employment and benefits led to the contested retirement provisions. Despite the collective bargaining agreement facilitated by IARE, the reduction in the mandatory retirement age to 65 for black firemen, while white counterparts were permitted to work until 70, echoes inequitable treatments addressed in Steele and Tunstall. Moreover, these earlier cases stress that historical discrimination, if perpetuated post-Act, constitutes a violation of Title VII.

In evaluating the Railroad’s claim of compliance with the Railway Labor Act, the court, drawing parallel reasoning from 414 F.2d 73, rejected the notion that adherence to intra-union settlements safeguards against Title VII scrutiny.

Thus, the discriminatory effects resulting from pre-Act practices, amplified by the age 65 retirement provision, trapped black firemen in a status quo condemned by earlier jurisprudence. This court rightly found in favor of the plaintiffs, remedying the perpetuation of discriminatory practices. The District Court's judgment is thereby affirmed, consistent with established precedent.
