"The employee [ ] carries the burden of showing that a particular accommodation rejected by the employer would have made the employee qualified to perform the essential functions of the job.” Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 954 (8th Cir.1999); accord Stafne v. Unicare Homes, 266 F.3d 771, 774 (8th Cir.2001). The only evidence in the record regarding this device is Brooks’s blind estimation that it costs around $100. (Brooks Dep. 60-61.)
