In this case, the court is concerned with a freedom of choice plan in the Noxubee County School District, where parents were given the option to enroll their children in either white or Negro schools. The court finds that appellees, who are school officials and local residents, engaged in a pattern of interference and coercion aimed at depriving Negro citizens of their constitutional right to enroll their children in an integrated school system.

The court cites reference case 372 F.2d 836, which held that the Constitution requires public school systems to integrate students, faculties, facilities, and activities. The court also references 380 F.2d 385, which emphasized the importance of cooperation between the judiciary and the other branches of government in achieving school desegregation.

The court finds that appellees' conduct was motivated by a desire to maintain the status quo and prevent integration. They used various tactics, including intimidation, threats, and economic pressure, to persuade Negro parents to withdraw their children from white schools. The court concludes that such conduct is not protected by the First Amendment and that injunctive relief is necessary to counteract the harassment and retaliation against Negro citizens.

The court reverses the decision of the District Court and orders injunctive relief against all appellees except Dinsmore and Hurst. The court's decision is guided by the principles of reference cases 372 F.2d 836 and 380 F.2d 385, which emphasize the importance of integrating public schools and preventing interference with the exercise of constitutional rights.
