The case of Wicker v. Board of Education of Knott County, Kentucky presents a complex issue of preclusion and abstention. The plaintiff, Wicker, was appointed as the Superintendent of Schools and Secretary of the Board of Education for Knott County, Kentucky. He was removed from office by the Board, alleging that he was not operating the school system's financial affairs properly. Wicker filed a lawsuit in federal court, alleging that his removal was without legal cause and in violation of his First Amendment rights.

The district court granted the defendants' motion to abstain, citing Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941). Wicker then filed a reservation of federal issues in the state court, stating that he intended to return to federal court to litigate his reserved claims. The state court issued a decision, holding that the Board had the authority to remove Wicker for cause.

On appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that Wicker's reservation of federal issues preserved his right to return to federal court. The court also held that the state court's decision had no preclusive effect on Wicker's federal claims, as the state court did not decide the issues of political bias and lack of legal cause.

The court cited England v. Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners, 375 U.S. 411 (1964), which held that a party may forestall a conclusion that he elected not to return to federal court by filing a reservation of federal issues in state court. The court also cited Lurie v. State of California, 633 F.2d 786 (9th Cir. 1980), which held that a party's intent to litigate federal claims in federal court, as expressed in a reservation, is a critical factor in determining whether the party has preserved his right to return to federal court.

In conclusion, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that Wicker's reservation of federal issues preserved his right to return to federal court and that the state court's decision had no preclusive effect on his federal claims. The court's decision is consistent with the doctrine of England v. Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners and Lurie v. State of California. (References: 383 F.2d 358, 753 F.2d 50)

United Kentucky Bank, Inc., 753 F.2d 50, 53 (6th Cir.1985) (interpreting Kentucky law). Applying that standard, it is clear that the state courts here neither actually nor necessarily determined whether the Board was motivated by political bias.
