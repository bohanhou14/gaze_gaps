The Center argues that the copyright registrations for the Songs relied upon by Ergo are void and invalid as a matter of law. The Defendants assert that since Ellstein and Manger assigned the copyright in "Yidl Mitn Fidl" to Lefkowitch, who subsequently published and registered the song with the United States Copyright Office under the Copyright Act of 1909, their reversionary interest was validly renewed by Sylvia Ellstein in 1966. However, for Ergo to establish copyright infringement, two elements must be demonstrated: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements that are original (see Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361). Ergo relies on a chain of title that is inadequately documented, raising doubts about the authenticity and validity of the claimed ownership.

Furthermore, the Center emphasizes that the Songs were created under the “work for hire” doctrine of the 1909 Act, which presumes ownership by the commissioning party, Green. As no contrary agreement has been satisfactorily evidenced, the ownership should revert to Green and, by extension, to the Center as per their January 1990 Agreement. Without meeting the burden of proof to demonstrate a valid chain of title as required by law (see 49 F.3d 807), Ergo's claims of copyright infringement lack the requisite substantiation.

Thus, the Center’s motion for partial summary judgment on the basis of invalid copyright registrations holds firm, swaying the balance in favor of their rightful ownership and dismissal of Ergo’s claims under 17 U.S.C. § 106.

See Feist Publications v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 1295-96, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991); CMM Cable Rep, Inc., 97 F.3d at 1512 (1st Cir.1996); Accusoft Corp. v.

It is the first prong of the suit requirement which here proves fatal to Ergo’s claim.
