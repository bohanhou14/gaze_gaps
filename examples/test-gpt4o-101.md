According to the defendants, EMT Hodson's affidavit contradicted her prior deposition testimony. Indeed, affidavits that conflict with prior sworn testimony may be stricken to avoid creating sham issues of fact to defeat summary judgments. This principle aligns with the precedent in Visser v. Packer Eng’g Assocs., 924 F.2d 655, 659 (7th Cir. 1991), which asserts that "testimony about matters outside their personal knowledge is not admissible." The district court has the discretion to strike such affidavits, as upheld in Zayre Corp. v. S.M. & R. Co., Inc., 882 F.2d 1145, 1150 (7th Cir. 1989).

Further, the inconsistency of Hodson’s affidavit with her earlier deposition renders it unreliable as probative evidence, backing the trial judge's decision to strike it. This is underscored by Timmons’s case in the 75 F.3d 290 reference, where the court rejected an affidavit for not qualifying as expert evidence under Daubert and highlighted the critical nature of consistent testimony to establish causation.

In summary, the district court correctly exercised its discretion to exclude both Dr. Lafferty’s expert testimony and EMT Hodson’s affidavit, considering their respective failures to meet the reliability and consistency standards mandated by Rule 702 and Daubert principles.

gold_text: The defendants moved to strike the affidavit from consideration during the summary judgment determination, and the trial court agreed and granted the motion to strike. The court found that Hodson’s affidavit was inadmissible because it “clearly contradicted” her prior deposition testimony. The judge relied on Unterreiner v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 8 F.3d 1206, 1210 (7th Cir.1993), which held that “[a] party cannot claim a lack of general knowledge about a subject and later make a statement which requires detailed knowledge about the same subject.” We review a district court’s decision to strike an affidavit for an abuse of discretion. See Buckner v. Sam’s Club, Inc., 75 F.3d 290, 292 (7th Cir.1996).
