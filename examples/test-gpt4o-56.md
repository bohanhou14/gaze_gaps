Mrs. Swenson also requests an award of attorney’s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d). According to precedent, obtaining a remand for reconsideration is insufficient to qualify as a prevailing party for the purposes of the EAJA (867 F.2d 1209; 28 U.S.C. § 2412 et seq.). However, we find that the Secretary’s position was not substantially justified, given the failure to specify reasons for discounting Swenson’s symptom testimony and the inconsistencies in the vocational expert’s evidence. This aligns with the district court's requirement to determine justification under 867 F.2d 1209 (Pierce v. Underwood). Therefore, the district court should consider awarding attorney’s fees (844 F.2d 664; REVERSED and REMANDED).

We reverse the district court's judgment and remand for payment of benefits and a determination on attorney’s fees consistent with our findings.

gold_text: Swenson requests attorney’s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412 (1982 & Supp. IV 1986). It allows prevailing plaintiffs in these cases to recover fees “unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified_” 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A); Hammock v. Bowen, 867 F.2d 1209, 1216 (9th Cir.1989). Swenson prevailed on the merits. See, e.g., Gregory v. Bowen, 844 F.2d 664, 667 (9th Cir.1988). Whether the Secretary’s position was substantially justified will be determined by the district court. Pierce v. Underwood, — U.S. —, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2547, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988); Hammock, 867 F.2d at 1216. We remand to that court to determine that matter.
