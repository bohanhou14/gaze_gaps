The consideration of multiple litigations and the possibility of simplifying judicial processes are crucial aspects outlined in precedent cases, which provide relevant guidance here. In Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co., 342 U.S. 180, the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of wise judicial administration and conservation of judicial resources. The Court counseled against rigid mechanical solutions and recognized an ample degree of discretion must be left to the lower courts. This perspective supports a single, comprehensive resolution to prevent duplicative litigations where possible.

Similarly, in the case referenced as 225 F.2d 603, it was noted that an injunction to prevent the initiation of actions in other forums could be justified if deciding the primary action could resolve the issues comprehensively. Such principles apply directly to the current dispute between Puritan Sportswear and Fashions. 

Applying these precedents, denying the preliminary injunction is consistent with promoting judicial efficiency and avoiding redundant litigation. Moreover, the motion for a stay of the action in California is supported by the rationale that all relevant issues can be adequately addressed in the present forum, ensuring all parties involved in the Eastern district case are comprehensively bound by a single, clear adjudication.

All the issues arising out of the controversy between the parties can and should be resolved in the action first started in this district. In the exercise of my discretion all further proceedings in the action commenced in the Southern District of California will be stayed pending the determination of the case at bar. See Kerotest Mfg.
