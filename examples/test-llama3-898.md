Based on the provided cases, we can analyze the scenario presented in the question. In the case of 439 U.S. 410, the court held that a plaintiff must show that the exercise of his constitutionally protected conduct played a "substantial" role in the employer's decision not to rehire him. The court also stated that the employer is entitled to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision even in the absence of the protected conduct.

In the case presented, Dr. Vargas was removed from his position as Head of the Department of Physiology due to political and national origin reasons. The reasons given by Dr. Nydia de Jesús for Dr. Vargas' removal were just a pretext to remove him from his position. The court finds that Dr. Vargas was subjected to harassment and discrimination due to his national origin and political beliefs. The court also finds that the protection of Dr. Vargas' constitutional rights outweighs any harm that could be vested upon the defendant.

According to the case of 429 U.S. 252, the court held that for a plaintiff to prove an individual claim of discriminatory treatment, whether under the Constitution or under Title VII, a plaintiff must prove purposeful discrimination. In this case, Dr. Vargas has met the burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination, and the burden shifts to the defendants to articulate some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employee's rejection. However, the explanation offered by Dr. Nydia de Jesús is not credible, and the court finds that Dr. Vargas was removed for national origin reasons.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of the cases presented, it is clear that Dr. Vargas was subjected to harassment and discrimination due to his national origin and political beliefs. The court finds that the protection of Dr. Vargas' constitutional rights outweighs any harm that could be vested upon the defendant, and that he was removed from his position for national origin reasons. <answer>
