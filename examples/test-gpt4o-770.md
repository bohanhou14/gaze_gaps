8. Collins argues that his previous criminal acquittal precludes this forfeiture action under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. However, this contention fails. In **465 U.S. 354**, the Supreme Court asserted that collateral estoppel does not apply where there is a difference in the burden of proof between criminal and civil proceedings. An acquittal in criminal court only proves reasonable doubt, not innocence, and thus does not prevent subsequent civil forfeiture actions.

9. Further reinforcing this principle, in **409 U.S. 232**, it was noted that the acquittal of criminal charges often does not resolve all relevant issues in civil forfeiture cases, especially when intent is an essential element in the criminal case but not in the civil forfeiture.

Based on the foregoing, the Government's civil forfeiture action here is not barred by Collins's previous acquittal. The probative evidence, such as the large sum of cash, the canine alert, and Collins's implausible explanations, meet the threshold of probable cause necessary to proceed with forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. § 881(a). Hence, Collins’s arguments on collateral estoppel and double jeopardy are insufficient to negate the Government’s action.

gold_text: 8. Civil forfeiture actions are independent of criminal proceedings. Thus, the Government is not required to show that the claimant was convicted of a crime related to the seized property. Likewise, an acquittal or dismissal of criminal charges does not affect the Government’s ability to pursue a civil forfeiture action, even if the civil forfeiture arises from the same activity.
