F. Failure to Grant a Mistrial

Defendants Patsy and Samuel Mays argue that the District Court's refusal to grant a mistrial based on alleged cumulative errors warrants reversal of their convictions. They claim the cumulative effect of these errors rendered their trial fundamentally unfair, thereby violating their Sixth Amendment rights. 

The Supreme Court has consistently held that claims of cumulative error must be evaluated based on their effect on the fairness of the trial process. In *United States v. Agurs*, 427 U.S. 97, the Court emphasized that prosecutorial misconduct should be measured by its impact on the trial's fairness, not the culpability of the prosecutor (cf. 466 U.S. 648). Similarly, in *Chambers v. Mississippi*, 410 U.S. 284, and *Avery v. Alabama*, 308 U.S. 444, the Court did not presume that external constraints on counsel inherently affected the trial’s fairness.

Additionally, the Court in *Morris v. Slappy*, 461 U.S. 1, underscored the need for deference to trial courts regarding scheduling issues, recognizing the complexities they face (cf. 466 U.S. 648). Therefore, absent a showing of actual prejudice that affects the trial's outcome, cumulative error claims are typically insufficient to warrant a mistrial.

On the issue of prejudice from the alleged errors, the standard set forth in *Chambers* and *Avery* guides our assessment. Defendants have not demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the sidebar comments, admission of hearsay, or delay in counsel appointment materially impacted the trial's fairness. The overwhelming evidence of guilt further supports this conclusion, as highlighted in our earlier discussions of each claimed error's impact individually.

Hence, based on the principles established in prior cases, we find that the District Court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial. The totality of the circumstances does not rise to the level of reversible cumulative error. Accordingly, the convictions of both defendants Patsy and Samuel Mays are AFFIRMED.

But for delay in appointing counsel to violate the Sixth Amendment, the defendant must generally prove prejudice. United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 658, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2046, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984)(“Absent some effect of challenged conduct on the reliability of the trial process, the Sixth Amendment guarantee is generally not implicated.”); Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 54, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 1982-83, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970)(“[W]e are not disposed to fashion a per se rule requiring reversal of every conviction following tardy appointment of counsel_”). Having failed to show prejudice by the nearly five-month delay before he was appointed new counsel, Samuel Mays is not entitled to reversal of conviction on this ground.
