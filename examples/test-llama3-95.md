In the case at hand, the plaintiff, Scott, is suing the defendants, Hire, for allegedly infringing on her copyrighted play, "Discretion". The plaintiff claims that the defendants' play, "Conditional Surrender", is a copy of her original work.

To establish copyright infringement, the plaintiff must prove that the defendants' play was copied from her copyrighted work and that the defendants unlawfully appropriated protected material from her work. The plaintiff argues that there are similarities between the two plays, including similar plots, characters, and settings.

However, the defendants argue that the similarities are not sufficient to establish copyright infringement. They point out that the plays are significantly different in terms of sequence, characterization, characters, scenes, settings, and style of writing.

The District Court found that the two plays are "two entirely different plays" and that there is no evidence or proof of direct access or even the possibility of access to the plaintiff's play by the author or producers of "Conditional Surrender".

In this case, the plaintiff's claim is similar to the case of 153 F.2d 893, where the court found that the defendant's work was not a copy of the plaintiff's work, but rather an independent creation. The court also noted that the doctrine of unconscious plagiarism is not applicable in this case.

Additionally, the plaintiff's claim is also similar to the case of 154 F.2d 480, where the court found that the similarity between the two works was not sufficient to establish copyright infringement. The court noted that the similarity was due to the use of a common source and that the works were not substantially similar.

In conclusion, based on the evidence presented, it appears that the defendants' play "Conditional Surrender" is not a copy of the plaintiff's copyrighted play "Discretion". The District Court's finding that the two plays are "two entirely different plays" and that there is no evidence or proof of direct access or even the possibility of access to the plaintiff's play by the author or producers of "Conditional Surrender" supports this conclusion.
