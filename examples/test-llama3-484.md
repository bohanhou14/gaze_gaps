The court in Schwinn vs. Goodyear (1969) 408 F.2d 1187, affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment, concluding that the design patent for a bicycle seat was invalid for obviousness. The court held that the design was not novel, as it was substantially anticipated by the prior art, and further, that it was not patentably distinct. The court relied on the Johnson case (1949) 300 F.2d 942, which established that a design patent must be novel and patentably distinct.

The court also relied on the case of In re Laverne (1966) 356 F.2d 1003, which held that the determination of patentability in design cases must finally rest on the subjective conclusion of each judge. The court concluded that the design was obvious in overall appearance, and that the presumption of validity under 35 U.S.C. ยง 282 was not conclusive.

In reaching its conclusion, the court considered the similarity in overall appearance between the patented design and the prior art, and found that the design was not patentably distinct. The court also considered the commercial success of the design, but did not find that it was a relevant factor in determining patentability.

In a similar vein, the court in Goodyear vs. Schwinn (1964) 300 F.2d 942, considered the novelty and patentability of a design patent for a tire valve stem. The court held that the design was not novel, as it was substantially anticipated by the prior art, and further, that it was not patentably distinct.

Finally, the court in In re Bigelow (1952) 194 F.2d 550, considered the patentability of a design for a lamp, and held that the design was not novel, as it was substantially anticipated by the prior art, and further, that it was not patentably distinct.

In conclusion, the court in Schwinn vs. Goodyear (1969) 408 F.2d 1187, followed the same reasoning as the courts in the other cases, and held that the design patent for a bicycle seat was invalid for obviousness. The court relied on the Johnson case (1949) 300 F.2d 942, and the cases of In re Laverne (1966) 356 F.2d 1003, and In re Bigelow (195
