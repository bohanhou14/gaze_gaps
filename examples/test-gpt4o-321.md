Appellants contend that the district court's decision disregards their allegations and fails to address genuine issues of material fact. Notably, they assert that the Council's failure to fully investigate the grievances led to an arbitrary and perfunctory settlement, as outlined in Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 190 (1967). The Court in Vaca emphasized that a union violates its duty if its processing of a grievance is "arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith."

However, the district court reviewed all submissions and found no substantial evidence of Council hostility post-Jones’s tenure or materially deficient procedures. This parallels the reasoning in Early v. Eastern Transfer, 699 F.2d 552, 556 (1st Cir.1983), where the absence of specific indicators in affidavits negated claims of unfair representation due to inadequate investigation.

Additionally, appellants’ assertion of the Council's bad faith resulting from the lack of communication does not constitute sufficient grounds for reversal, as per the standard in Findley v. Jones Motor Freight, Inc., 639 F.2d 953, 959 (3d Cir.1981). The district court's analysis remains consistent with the principles established in Hayes v. New England Millwork, 602 F.2d 15, 19 (1st Cir.1979), requiring specific allegations of arbitrariness or perfunctory grievance handling.

Hence, plaintiffs' failure to present concrete evidence of arbitrary or discriminatory actions by the Council affirms the district court's summary judgment. The reasoning found in the detailed assessments of 595 F.2d 890 and 386 U.S. 171 supports this conclusion, underscoring the necessity of genuine material facts to challenge a summary dismissal effectively.

gold_text: One final issue is whether summary judgment should have issued before plaintiffs’ interrogatories, seeking information about the extent of investigation of the grievances by the Council, were answered. Wholly apart from the conclusory nature of plaintiffs’ argument that such information would be significant, appellants never sought to invoke Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f). They did not file an affidavit to obtain a continuance to undertake needed discovery nor did' they in any way indicate that lack of discovery was an issue. They cannot now raise it for the first time. Johnston v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 595 F.2d 890 (1st Cir. 1979). Because we find no genuine issue as to unfair representation, summary judgment also was appropriate in favor of the employer, Greyhound. Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 187, 192-94, 87 S.Ct. 903, 915, 917-18, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967).
