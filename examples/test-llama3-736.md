ORDER DENYING MOTION TO TRANSFER
The Court is presented with a motion to transfer a case to the Western District of New York, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a), based on a forum-selection clause contained in the Xerox Corporation Long-Term Disability Income Plan ("LTD Plan"). The LTD Plan, an "employee welfare benefit plan" under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1), provides that any action in connection with the Plan may only be brought in Federal District Court in Monroe County, New York.

The Court notes that the forum-selection clause is enforceable, citing Rodriguez v. PepsiCo Long Term Disability Plan, 716 F.Supp.2d 855, 860 (N.D.Cal. 2010), and Smith v. Aegon USA LLC, 770 F.Supp.2d 809, 812 (W.D.Va.2011). These cases hold that enforcement of forum selection clauses is not inconsistent with the terms or policy rationales of ERISA. The Court also finds that the Ninth Circuit's decision in Grosz-Salomon v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1154, 1160 (9th Cir.2001), is instructive, as it explains that a participant's cause of action accrues on the date the claim is denied, not on the date the benefits were first granted.

In light of these authorities, the Court denies the motion to transfer the case to the Western District of New York. The case will proceed in this District, in accordance with the forum-selection clause.

M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407, U.S. 1, 15, 92 S.Ct. 1907, 32 L.Ed.2d 513 (1972); Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U.S. 585, 593-94, 111 S.Ct. 1522, 113 L.Ed.2d 622 (1991) (finding venue selection clauses to be binding even if the contract in question was not negotiated). In Laasko, a district court in the Central District of California found that the specific forum selection clause at issue in this case was not fundamentally unfair and did not contravene public policy. 566 F.Supp.2d at 1023-24. In fact, the court stated “enforcement of the forum selection clause in this case actually advances one of the purposes of ERISA by ‘bringing a measure of uniformity in an area where decisions under the same set of facts may differ from state to state.’ ” Id. at 122 (citing Bird v. Shearson Lehman/American Express, Inc., 926 F.2d 116, 122 (2d Cir.1991)). This district has similarly found that “limiting claims to one federal district encourages uniformity in the decisions interpreting that plan, which furthers ERISA’s goal of enabling employers to establish a uniform administrative scheme” Rodriguez, 716 F.Supp.2d at 861 (internal citations omitted).
