As we have seen in the reference cases, the requirements on small and new political organizations are different from those of established parties. In Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U.S. 431 (1971), the Court recognized the importance of allowing some preliminary showing of support before printing a political organization's candidate on the ballot. Similarly, in American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U.S. 767 (1974), the Court held that a 1% petition requirement was a reasonable way to regulate the number of candidates on the ballot and avoid confusion and frustration of the democratic process.

In the present case, North Carolina's May 17 petition-filing deadline, combined with the two percent signature requirement, may impose a modest burden on Plaintiffs' ability to form new parties and nominate candidates. However, we must balance this burden against the state's interest in ensuring that "order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the democratic processes." McLaughlin v. N.C. Bd. of Elections, 65 F.3d 1215, 1221 (4th Cir.1995). North Carolina has insulated not a single potential voter from the appeal of new political voices within its borders. The state's interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot and avoiding confusion and frustration of the democratic process is sufficient to justify the limitation imposed on Plaintiffs' rights.

In contrast to the March 20 filing deadline in Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983), which the Court held unconstitutional, North Carolina's May 17 deadline falls after the state's May primary. This makes a significant difference in the burden imposed on Plaintiffs. Furthermore, Plaintiffs have ample time and opportunity to collect the reasonable number of required signatures, which reduces the burden on them.

In conclusion, we affirm the district court's decision upholding the May 17 petition-filing deadline. While it may impose a modest burden on Plaintiffs, it is a reasonable requirement that advances the state's interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot and avoiding confusion and frustration of the democratic process. The deadline is narrowly tailored to achieve this goal and does not violate Plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

gold_text: To support its choice of a May 17 deadline, North Carolina relies on its general interest in regulating the election process. There is “an important state interest in requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization’s candidate on the ballot&emdash;the interest, if no other, in avoiding confusion, deception, and even frustration of the democratic process at the general election.” Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U.S. 431, 442, 91 S.Ct. 1970, 29 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). States are not required “to make a particularized showing of the existence of voter confusion, ballot overcrowding, or the presence of frivolous candidacies prior to the imposition of reasonable restrictions on ballot access.” Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, 194-95, 107 S.Ct. 533, 93 L.Ed.2d 499 (1986). 'Indeed, states have an interest “in ensuring -orderly, fair, and efficient procedures for the election of public officials.” See S. C. Green Party, 612 F.3d at 759. This interest necessarily requires the imposition of some cutoff period “to verify the validity of signatures on the petitions, to print the ballots, and, if necessary, to litigate any challenges.” See Am. Party of Tex. v. White, 415 U.S. 767, 787, n. 18, 94 S.Ct. 1296, 39 L.Ed.2d 744 (1974).
