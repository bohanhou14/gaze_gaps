The threshold for granting a new trial based on insufficiency of the evidence is high, requiring that the verdict be "against the great weight of the evidence" or that it results in a "seriously erroneous" outcome (115 F.3d 676, Venegas v. Wagner, 831 F.2d 1514, 1519 (9th Cir.1987)). Jensen contends that the district court's evidentiary rulings prejudiced her case, meriting a new trial. It is important to note that evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion and should not be reversed absent some prejudice (City of Long Beach v. Standard Oil Co., 46 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.1995); 64 F.3d 1323). Upon review, there is no substantial showing that the evidentiary rulings substantially prejudiced Jensen to an extent that warrants a new trial (United States v. 99.66 Acres of Land, 970 F.2d 651, 658 (9th Cir.1992); United States v. Dunn, 946 F.2d 615, 617 (9th Cir.1991)).

Furthermore, Jensen failed to demonstrate that the jury's verdict was against the great weight of the evidence. Given the jury’s role in resolving conflicting testimonies, the district court’s decision to deny a new trial adheres to the principle of giving due deference to the jury's findings (115 F.3d 676; Venegas v. Wagner, 831 F.2d 1514, 1519 (9th Cir.1987)).

Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jensen's motion for a new trial.

gold_text: A jury verdict should ordinarily be set aside only when it is against the “great weight” of the evidence or it is clear that the jury has reached a “seriously erroneous result.” EEOC v. Pape Lift, Inc., 115 F.3d 676, 680 (9th Cir.1997) (quoting Venegas v. Wagner, 831 F.2d 1514, 1519 (9th Cir.1987)). When a new trial is sought on the basis of erroneous evidentiary rulings, a new trial is warranted only if those erroneous rulings substantially prejudiced the moving party. See Ruvalcaba v. City of Los Angeles, 64 F.3d 1323, 1328 (9th Cir.1995).
