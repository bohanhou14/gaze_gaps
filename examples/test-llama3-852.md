The defendant National City Bank moves for the dismissal of the amended complaint under Rules 56 and 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on five grounds. The third and fourth counts, in the alternative, are addressed to this moving defendant.

The motion for summary judgment on the ground that the claims are barred by limitation is denied. The cases cited by the defendant, such as Brick v.

Henry, 1897, 152 N.Y. 529, 539, 46 N.E. 837.

Fairmont Creamery Co., 8 Cir., 1943, 139 F.2d 318, 322; Standard Rolling Mills, Inc., v. National Mineral Co., D.C.E.D.N.Y.1942, 2 F.R.D. 236, 237. This burden the defendant has not sustained.
