**Generation:**

In this case, the Debtors did not present any special circumstances that could legitimately rebut the presumption of abuse under § 707(b)(2). According to the precedent set in the reference case 362 B.R. 846, to rebut the presumption of abuse, the Debtors must demonstrate "special circumstances," such as a serious medical condition or active duty in the Armed Forces. The Debtors have neither shown evidence of such special circumstances nor provided an alternative justification for their significant income adjustments.

Moreover, in reference case 364 B.R. 640, it is outlined that even if no presumption of abuse arises under § 707(b)(2), a case can still be dismissed under § 707(b)(3) based on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the debtor's financial situation demonstrates abuse. In light of the revised financial figures and a lack of credible special circumstances, the Court finds the Debtors failed to rebut the presumption of abuse effectively.

Thus, the totality of the evidence underscores a finding of abuse under § 707(b)(1) and § 707(b)(2). Based on the calculations and the supporting case law, the Debtors' Chapter 7 case stands to be dismissed.

It is therefore ORDERED that the Motion of the United States Trustee to Dismiss the Debtors' Chapter 7 case is GRANTED, effective immediately.

But as this Court has also noted, § 707(b)(2)(B) “goes on to set this bar extremely high, placing it effectively off limits for most debtors.” In re Wright, 364 B.R. 640, 642 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2007).
