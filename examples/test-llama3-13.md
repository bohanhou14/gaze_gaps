The cases provided are reference cases for legal proceedings. Case 348 U.S. 19 is a landmark case that discusses the concept of negligence in the context of a ship collision. In this case, the court held that the respondent was negligent in permitting Chinese passengers to board the ship, which led to the petitioner contracting polio. The court found that it was reasonable to infer that the Chinese passengers were the carriers of the polio virus and that they contaminated the petitioner.

Similarly, Case 235 F.2d 741 discusses the concept of trial de novo and the importance of the trial court's findings. The court holds that the trial court's findings are not clearly erroneous and that the owners of both vessels are appealing the decision.

In analyzing the case at hand, we can apply the principles discussed in these reference cases. In the present case, the Anita D and the Velma Lykes collided in the Houston Ship Channel. The trial court found both vessels at fault for the collision. We agree with the trial court's decision, but we arrive at it through a different route.

The situation presented to the Anita D and the Velma Lykes was not a crossing situation, but rather a situation that required caution and prudence. Both vessels were aware of the possibility of collision and failed to take necessary precautions. The Anita D knew that the Velma Lykes might take the Houston fork of the channel and would thereby place herself on a collision course with the Anita D. Similarly, the Velma Lykes knew that when she came to the vee, she would adjust her course to run the Houston Ship Channel and would thereby place herself on a collision course with the Anita D.

In conclusion, the case at hand is a classic example of a situation that requires caution and prudence. Both vessels were aware of the possibility of collision and failed to take necessary precautions. The trial court's decision is affirmed, and the owners of both vessels are found liable for the collision.
