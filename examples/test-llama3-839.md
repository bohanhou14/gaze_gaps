The case at hand involves a dispute between Addison Airport of Texas, Inc. (“AATI”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) regarding attorney’s fees. AATI argues that it is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (“EAJA”) based on the government’s unsuccessful defense of its position.

The court first addresses whether the FDIC’s position was substantially justified. In International Woodworkers of America v. Donovan, 792 F.2d 762, the court held that the government’s position must be justified to a degree that would satisfy a reasonable person. In this case, the FDIC’s arguments were not supported by the estoppel letter and were therefore not substantially justified.

The court then turns to the issue of attorney’s fees. In Aston v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 808 F.2d 9, the court held that fees for paralegal and law clerk time are recoverable under the EAJA. The court awards AATI attorney’s fees at a rate of $97.50 per hour, which is based on the consumer price index for services in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

In conclusion, the court finds that the FDIC’s position was not substantially justified, and therefore AATI is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees under the EAJA. The court awards AATI attorney’s fees at a rate of $97.50 per hour for 139.1 hours of expended time.
