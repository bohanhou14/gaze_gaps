The cases mentioned in the reference articles have different scenarios and legal issues, but they all share the common theme of understanding the laws and regulations related to detaining individuals, imposing penalties, and licensing professionals.

In the case of Volksen, the court found that the district court's ruling was supported by clear and convincing evidence, as the government presented overwhelming evidence that Volksen was a narcotics trafficker. The court also noted that the government's evidence went beyond the rebuttable presumption against pretrial release and found that Volksen did not present evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption.

In the case of 411 U.S. 356, the court held that the civil penalty prescribed in the regulation was not unconstitutional, as it was modest and the prohibited conduct was clearly set out in the regulation. The court also noted that Congress did not intend to tailor civil penalty provisions to deal precisely with each step that the agency would find necessary.

In the case of 526 F.2d 319, the court held that the regulation 42 C.F.R. ยง 252.10 was constitutional, as it did not discriminate against nursing home administrators and did not impinge upon powers reserved to the state under the Tenth Amendment. The court also noted that the due process and equal protection doctrines do not constitute an absolute ban on classifications.

In the case of Cullen Drive-In Grocery, the court held that the permanent disqualification of the store was warranted, as the store had violated the Food Stamp Act by acquiring food stamps of a value in excess of $100.00 by unlawful purchase for cash. The court also noted that the regulation 7 C.F.R. ยง 278.6(f) prohibited a civil money penalty in lieu of permanent disqualification.

In conclusion, the cases mentioned in the reference articles demonstrate the importance of understanding the laws and regulations related to detaining individuals, imposing penalties, and licensing professionals. The courts have consistently held that the regulations and laws are constitutional and warranted, as they are meant to ensure public safety and protect the rights of individuals.

Because this contention is only stated as a conclusion and is not briefed at all we need not address it. United States v. Volksen, 766 F.2d 190, 193 (5th Cir.1985).
