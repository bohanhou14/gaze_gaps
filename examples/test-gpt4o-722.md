Under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3585(b), a defendant is entitled to credit towards the service of a term of imprisonment for any time spent in official detention prior to the commencement of the sentence. The key issue here is whether the 126 days the defendant spent in Community Treatment Centers (CTCs) should be credited towards his revocation sentence. The term "official detention" has been interpreted in various circuits. For instance, in 967 F.2d 1397, the Court held that time spent in a treatment center can be considered "official detention" for the purposes of section 3585(b), suggesting that restrictive conditions in such facilities are akin to incarceration. 

Similarly, the case of Brown v. Rison, 895 F.2d 533 (9th Cir. 1990), supports this interpretation by noting that the degree of restriction in some treatment facilities can equate to custody, thus warranting credit towards the sentence. However, for such credit to apply under section 3585(b), the detention must have been prior to the commencement of the sentence and must be a result of the offense for which the sentence was imposed. Given that the defendant's time in CTCs was served as a condition of supervised release after completion of his initial term of imprisonment, it does not fulfill the criteria of section 3585(b) for the revocation sentence. Consequently, defendant's petition for credit for CTC time against his revocation sentence must be denied.

Therefore, based on these precedents and the statutory requirements, the motion and petition are denied.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
