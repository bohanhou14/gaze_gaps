In the case of United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277, the court held that a corporation and its officers can be held liable for violating the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Similarly, in the case of United States v. Burns, the court held that a corporation and its officers can be held liable for violating the Securities Act and the mail fraud statute.

In the case of United States v. Burns, the defendant, J. Phil Burns, was found guilty of violating the Securities Act and the mail fraud statute. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction of Burns on each of the 15 counts of which he was found guilty and sentenced.

The court also held that the rejection of the offered testimony as to the attitude, habits, and customs of Burns in regard to prayer was proper. The court further held that the curtailment of the examination relative to the satellite company was reasonable action by the court to prevent the lengthening of the trial by an exploration of collateral issues.
