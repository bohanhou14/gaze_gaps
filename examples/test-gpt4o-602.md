Gelman further argues that Illinois public policy necessitates excess insurers to cover losses when an underlying insurer becomes insolvent. However, similar claims have been unpersuasive in previous cases. In Zurich Ins. Co. v. Heil Co., 815 F.2d 1122, the court concluded that the plain language of the policy dictates the extent of coverage, clearly stating that the primary insurer's failure, whether due to insolvency or other issues, does not necessitate the excess insurer's "drop down" to cover underlying losses.

Moreover, in the case cited at 851 F.2d 957, the court emphasized that when an insurance contract clearly delineates coverage limits and requirements, these terms must be respected unless explicitly stated otherwise. The court noted that policies which did not explicitly account for insolvency in their terms generally did not impose liability on the excess insurer to "drop down."

In this instance, Hudson's policy with Gelman unequivocally limits Hudson’s liability to losses between $21 and $25 million, contingent upon the payment or liability of the $21 million by underlying insurers. Without an ambiguous or specific provision addressing insolvency, Hudson’s obligations remain unchanged. Hence, public policy does not override the unambiguous contract terms between Hudson and Gelman.

Thus, the district court's summary judgment for Hudson is affirmed, as there is no contractual ambiguity or overriding public policy necessitating Hudson to "drop down" due to Mission's insolvency.

gold_text: We find more appropriate a comparison with our decision in Zurich Ins. Co. v. Heil Co., 815 F.2d 1122 (7th Cir.1987). In a case applying Wisconsin law, we distinguished MacNeal’s “amount recoverable” language from an insurance contract with language similar to the Hudson-Gelman agreement. Relying on the “plain language” of the contract, we held that the excess insurer was not required to “drop down” to provide coverage for the insolvent underlying insurer. We reached a similar decision applying Indiana law in U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. Charter Financial Group, 851 F.2d 957 (7th Cir.1988). We again distinguished MacNeal because of the “amount recoverable” language, and found that the excess insurer need not “drop down,” stating that
