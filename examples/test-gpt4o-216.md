Saavedra relies on these cases to argue that pre-death pain and suffering damages should be considered part of a general maritime survival action. However, the Supreme Court's decision in Zicherman (498 U.S. 19), addressing the Warsaw Convention and DOHSA, forecloses such claims under American law, including nonpecuniary damages like pre-death pain and suffering. The Court in Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618 (1978), also clarified that congressional statutes limit recoverable damages in wrongful death suits to pecuniary losses, precluding nonpecuniary damages.

Given these precedents, Saavedra's contention that general maritime law supplements DOHSA is not tenable in this context. Saavedra’s failure to introduce evidence of Korean law at trial further undermines this theory. Consequently, the district court’s awards for pre-death pain and suffering and survivor’s grief are vacated, conforming to the controlling statutes and Supreme Court rulings.

Lastly, we affirm the district court’s application of prejudgment interest at the 52-week T-Bill rate prior to the judgment, as no abuse of discretion is evident.

gold_text: If Evich I and Evich II were the only relevant precedents, Saavedra’s argument for pre-death pain and suffering damages would be persuasive; however, several subsequent Supreme Court decisions, culminating with Zicherman, undoubtedly preclude such relief. The first is Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 98 S.Ct. 2010, 56 L.Ed.2d 581 (1978), where the Court held that because DOHSA bars nonpecuniary damages, DOHSA may not be supplemented with a general maritime wrongful death action for nonpecuniary damages, specifically loss of society damages. The Court explained that “when [Congress] does speak directly to a question, the courts are not free to ‘supplement’ Congress’ answer so thoroughly that the Act becomes meaningless.” Id. at 625, 98 S.Ct. at 2015. The Court applied similar logic in Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19, 34-36, 111 S.Ct. 317, 326-328, 112 L.Ed.2d 275 (1990), holding that since the survival action created by the Jones Act bars recovery for loss of future earnings, a supplemental survival action under general maritime law, allowing recovery for loss of future earnings, is impermissible. Miles therefore overruled Evich II, insofar as Evich II allowed a general maritime survival action for loss of future earnings. Davis, 27 F.3d at 430. Finally, in Zicherman, the Court rejected the view, adopted by the Second Circuit, that general maritime law ordinarily governs domestic actions brought under the Warsaw Convention, stressing that the Warsaw Convention does not “empower [the courts] to develop some common law rule — under general admiralty law or otherwise — that will supersede the normal federal disposition.”
