In the case of Clement A. Evans & Co., Inc. v. William J. McAlpine, Jr., et al., the court did not instruct the jury on the concept of due diligence as a defense to the plaintiff's claim. However, the court did charge the jury that the plaintiff had a duty of reasonable diligence to discover the existence of the alleged fraud. This is similar to the concept of due diligence discussed in reference case 361 F.2d 260, where the court held that a plaintiff must show that it exercised due diligence in discovering the alleged fraud.

In another reference case, 298 F. Supp. 66, the court held that a plaintiff must show that it had knowledge of facts sufficient to excite its inquiry and that the peculiar circumstances of the case were sufficient to impose upon the plaintiff a duty of reasonable diligence.

In the present case, the court's charge to the jury was that if the plaintiff had knowledge of facts sufficient to excite its inquiry and failed to exercise this duty, then the jury should return a verdict for the defendants. This is consistent with the views expressed in City National Bank of Fort Smith, Ark. v. Vanderboom, 422 F.2d 221 (8th Cir. 1970), where the court held that a plaintiff must show that it exercised due care in light of all facts effectively imposing a duty of reasonable investigation.

In conclusion, the court's charge to the jury in the present case was consistent with the concept of due diligence discussed in reference cases 361 F.2d 260 and 298 F. Supp. 66, and the views expressed in City National Bank of Fort Smith, Ark. v. Vanderboom, 422 F.2d 221 (8th Cir. 1970).
