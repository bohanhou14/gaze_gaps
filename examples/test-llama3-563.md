The cases of 327 U.S. 173 and 90 L. Ed. 603 are relevant to the discussion of whether the construction of small water dams, or "water retarding structures," falls under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The FLSA establishes a fair minimum wage and the maximum hours that a person can work at that wage.

In the case of 327 U.S. 173, the Supreme Court held that the employees engaged in the construction of a dam to furnish water to a municipality were not covered under the FLSA. The court concluded that the construction of the dam was not "in commerce" or "directly essential to the production" of goods for commerce. This case is relevant to the present dispute, as it suggests that the construction of small water dams, like the ones at issue, may not be considered "commerce" or "directly essential to the production" of goods for commerce.

In the case of 90 L. Ed. 603, the Supreme Court held that the employees engaged in the construction of a multiple-purpose dam were not covered under the FLSA. The court concluded that the construction of the dam was not "in commerce" or "directly essential to the production" of goods for commerce. This case is also relevant to the present dispute, as it suggests that the construction of small water dams, like the ones at issue, may not be considered "commerce" or "directly essential to the production" of goods for commerce.

In light of these cases, it appears that the construction of small water dams, like the ones at issue, may not be considered "commerce" or "directly essential to the production" of goods for commerce. Therefore, it is unlikely that the employees engaged in the construction of these dams are covered under the FLSA. The cases of 327 U.S. 173 and 90 L. Ed. 603 provide significant guidance in this regard, and their holdings are relevant to the present dispute.
