OPINION
The case at hand involves a discovery dispute between plaintiff and defendant Lufthansa. Lufthansa claims that it is prohibited from producing documents and information from its German offices without the prior approval of the German Ministry of Transport. The court has framed the problem in terms of assisting individual plaintiffs in their suits against corporate defendants, noting that discovery is not a one-way proposition (329 U.S. 495).

The court has rejected Lufthansa's arguments that it should not be required to produce documents prior to a resolution of jurisdiction and the issue of what, if any, aspects of the complaint state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The court has also rejected Lufthansa's claims of de facto immunity and its argument that the German Ministry's refusal to permit discovery is a defense to a discovery request.

The court has noted that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany has rendered the Hague Convention ineffective in the context of this proceeding. The court has concluded that the Hague Convention does not constitute the exclusive means by which plaintiff may secure discovery from Lufthansa, and that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure may be applied (437 U.S. 340).

The court has ordered Lufthansa to make applications to the German Ministry of Transport as required by its German permit to comply with all of plaintiff's discovery requests. The court has also deferred entry of an order on plaintiff's motion to compel for an additional thirty days to allow the German authorities to decide whether they wish to provide cooperation within the spirit of the Hague Convention and of comity between nations.

In conclusion, the court has held that Lufthansa is required to comply with plaintiff's discovery requests and has rejected Lufthansa's claims of de facto immunity and its argument that the German Ministry's refusal to permit discovery is a defense to a discovery request. The court has also deferred entry of an order on plaintiff's motion to compel for an additional thirty days to allow the German authorities to decide whether they wish to provide cooperation within the spirit of the Hague Convention and of comity between nations.

There is likewise no merit to specific objections made regarding the depositions of Reinhardt Abraham, Lufthansa’s vice chairman, and Herbert Culman, its former chairman.
