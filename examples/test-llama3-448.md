In reviewing the case, it is essential to consider the principles set forth in reference cases such as 346 U.S. 86, 313 U.S. 177, and 368 U.S. 81. These cases emphasize the importance of expert discretion in administrative decisions and the limited role of the judiciary in reviewing such decisions.

The court must determine whether the Commission has followed correct legal procedures and principles, but beyond that, it is permitted no greater role than ascertaining whether there exists a rational basis for the ICC order. In this case, the ICC conclusions were supported by a rational basis, and the court cannot substitute its own view concerning what should be done for the Commission's judgment.

The findings made by the ICC were adequate under Section 8(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. Section 1007(b), and no purpose would be accomplished by returning the case to the ICC for further findings. The court concluded that the ICC was aware of what it was doing and intended the result it achieved, and that the order stands or falls on the sufficiency of the findings made and the evidence to support them.

The court also considered the principles set forth in reference cases such as 315 U.S. 475, 294 U.S. 499, and 371 U.S. 156, which emphasize the importance of considering the transportation standard and other transportation conditions in determining whether a rate disparity is undue and unreasonable. The ICC's conclusion that Corpus Christi's disadvantage amounts to undue prejudice was clearly stated, and the court cannot say that this decision was without a rational basis.

In conclusion, the court concludes that the ICC order should be enforced and the complaints dismissed. The court's decision is based on a thorough analysis of the principles set forth in reference cases and the evidence presented in the record. The court's limited role in reviewing administrative decisions is recognized, and the decision is made with a clear understanding of the importance of expert discretion and the need to consider the transportation standard and other transportation conditions in determining whether a rate disparity is undue and unreasonable.
