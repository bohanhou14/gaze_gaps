The power of the court to send process across state lines to effectuate the purposes of the law has significant precedence. As underlined in 294 U.S. 648, jurisdiction over property extends wherever such property may be located, allowing the court to send process for service upon individuals wherever they may be within the United States. Similarly, in this case, the court's authority to intervene and appoint a trustee over the Franklin Garden Apartments, Inc.'s property and the collection of rents aligns with the statutes. The rationale is to preserve the integrity and value of the mortgaged property under Sections 256 and 257 of the Chandler Act.

Furthermore, referencing 113 F.2d 45, the court's discretion in handling reorganization proceedings underscores its jurisdictional reach and the responsibility to act in the best interest of creditors and the debtor. In the present case, the trustee's use of rentals to enhance property value without unduly harming the mortgagee's rights mirrors the principles upheld in previous rulings.

However, it is vital to balance the use of rentals for operating expenses versus administrative expenses. While operating expenses may be deemed necessary to maintain the property's value, administrative expenses should be scrutinized to ensure they do not unjustly encroach upon the mortgageeâ€™s secured interests unless the collateral has derived proportional benefit from such proceedings, akin to Randolph v. Scruggs, 190 U.S. 533.

In conclusion, the court's order to award possession to the trustee and permit the collection and appropriate allocation of rents is consistent with established judicial precedents and statutory mandates.

gold_text: Since the decision in Continental Illinois Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & P. Ry. Co., 294 U.S. 648, 675, 55 S.Ct. 595, 79 L.Ed. 1110, we have no doubt of the power of the district court to take possession of the mortgaged premises, collect the rents and enjoin the mortgagee from interfering therewith. Clark Bros. Co. v. Portex Oil Co., 9 Cir., 113 F.2d 45, 47. We cannot know what further may be done until the submission of a plan of reorganization or the failure to achieve one. It is possible that one may be proposed which will leave a sufficient equity to justify the application of rental receipts to expenses of the proceeding and to the completion of building and procurement of equipment. It may leave the mortgagee in a better position than at present and not meet with any objection.
