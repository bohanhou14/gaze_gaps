In the context of the given legal cases, it is essential to understand the relevant rules and procedures that govern relief from judgment. According to Rule 60(b)(6), a court may grant relief from judgment for any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. However, this rule is not applicable in all circumstances. In Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, the Supreme Court held that the circumstances alleged in the motion which brought the defendant within Rule 60(b)(6) must be exceptional or extraordinary.

In the case at hand, Clemente's pro se request for relief from judgment and certification of appealability is not justified. The Court has already considered the same issues and denied the motion for new trial and to amend the Judgment Entry and Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Dated July 1, 1997. Additionally, Clemente's counsel had authority to enter into a settlement agreement, which Clemente does not dispute. The settlement agreement provided that Clemente would not file a notice of appeal, and it is clear that Clemente is not entitled to relief from judgment.

In Harrison v. Clemente, 867 F.2d 291, the Sixth Circuit found that there were material issues of fact and that the plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case of intentional discrimination. The court determined that the reasons given by the defendants why the inference of racial discrimination should not be drawn may be rejected by the fact-finder as not credible while the plaintiffs' evidence of discriminatory animus may be accepted. This case highlights the importance of following the proper procedures for relief from judgment and the need to demonstrate exceptional or extraordinary circumstances.

In conclusion, Clemente's pro se request for relief from judgment and certification of appealability is not justified. The Court has already considered the same issues and denied the motion for new trial and to amend the Judgment Entry and Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Dated July 1, 1997. Additionally, Clemente's counsel had authority to enter into a settlement agreement, which Clemente does not dispute. The settlement agreement provided that Clemente would not file a notice of appeal, and it is clear that Clemente is not entitled to relief from judgment. The case of Harrison v.

It is apparent that Clemente is seeking to use Rule 60(b) in order to obtain relief which could have been obtained on direct appeal from either the entry of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (Doc. 106) and Judgment Entry (Doc. 107) or the denial of the first post-judgment motion, or both. It is well-settled that a motion under Rule 60(b) may not be used as a substitute for appeal. Hopper v. Euclid Manor Nursing Home, Inc., 867 F.2d 291, 294 (6th Cir.1989); see also Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198, 71 S.Ct. 209, 95 L.Ed. 207 (1950) (noting that a Rule 60(b) motion should not be used to obtain by the Rule that which should have been sought via direct appeal).
