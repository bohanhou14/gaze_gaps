Furthermore, Plaintiff Roberts seeks to amend her response to include her termination from the university police department. The defendant argues this amendment should be barred due to the timing of the original charge. However, in the case of newly occurring acts of discrimination that are reasonably related to the initial EEOC charge, these can be encompassed within the judicial complaint without necessitating a return to the state agency. As noted in the reference case 482 F.2d 569, the court permitted the inclusion of such acts occurring during the pendency of the EEOC charge. This principle aligns with the ruling in Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 465-467 (5th Cir. 1970), highlighting that new instances related to the original complaint do not warrant separate filings. Thus, Roberts' termination can arguably be seen as part of the ongoing discrimination alleged initially.

Defendant has also highlighted the possibility of summary judgment based on the provided affidavits. In disputes where affidavits provide substantive evidence on the matter, the court may find summary judgment appropriate, as demonstrated in reference case 459 F.2d 811.

Therefore, considering the precedents set forth in 482 F.2d 569 and 459 F.2d 811, the court should allow the amendment and consider summary judgment based on the additional affidavits presented, ensuring all claims are scrutinized within the legal framework.

gold_text: Finally, Roberts has attempted to supplement her answer to Interrogatory No. 7 adding her discharge as an additional incident of discrimination. This incident of discrimination was not included in her EEOC charge since termination occurred after the EEOC had processed her charge. Roberts, however, did not attempt to file an EEOC charge based on her discharge. Generally, a court has no jurisdiction to entertain a complaint in a Title VII action based other than on the discrimination alleged in the EEOC charge and any discrimination like or reasonably related to the allegations of the EEOC charge, including new acts occurring during the pendency of the charge before the EEOC. See Oubichon v. North American Rockwell Corp., 482 F.2d 569, 571 (9th Cir. 1973). Discharge in retaliation for filing charges of discrimination and because of an employee’s sex is not an incident like or reasonably related to the allegation of sex discrimination resulting in unfair treatment in promotion, compensation, job assignments, training, job classification, testing, qualifications, seniority and hiring. See Moore v. Sunbeam Corp., 459 F.2d 811, 826 n.38 (7th Cir. 1972) (“[S]ince discharge was not encompassed within the charge filed with the EEOC, it may not form the basis for a complaint in the federal district court.”). See also Thomas v. Arizona Board of Regents, No. Civ. 78-141-TUC (D. Ariz. Sept. 18, 1978) (plaintiff’s claim of retaliatory harassment is materially different from the charge of sex discrimination in wages presented to the EEOC and thus the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the claim of retaliatory harassment). Plaintiff’s eleventh-hour attempt to include the claim of discrimination based on her discharge by supplementing her answer to Interrogatory No. 7, more-" over, has prejudiced the defendant’s opportunity to engage in additional discovery concerning a claim of discrimination in employment based on this incident. Thus, the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the claim, and even if the Court did have jurisdiction, the plaintiff is estopped to assert a claim of discrimination based on her discharge in this action. Therefore,
