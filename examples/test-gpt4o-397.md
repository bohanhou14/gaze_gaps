**Generation:**

Before us, the defendants cite two precedents
For dismissals due to litigant negligence.
The first is addressed in the Hicks case, 850 F.2d 152,
Where sanctioned was the plaintiff for failing to attend,
Despite the court’s warning, the depositions in session,
Thus justifying dismissal for his willful transgression.

The second, cited as 747 F.2d 863,
Deals with a plaintiff's failure to produce
Interrogatory answers in delaying abuse,
Leading to dismissal, confirming the district court’s decree,
Affirmed despite a lack of contumacious conduct or spree.

Defendants draw parallels to invoke our discretion,
For transcribed notes mislaid by Mesis, in question.
Yet the cases referenced show no evidence here
Of willful destruction or obstruction severe,
As seen in the patterns of behavior defined
Within the cited precedents, each clearly outlined.

Thus, despite defendants' fervent assertions,
The Court sees no grounds for these severe sanctions,
Finding Mesis' actions not to rise to the level
Of willful misconduct nor devious dishevel.
Therefore, the motion for sanctions must be denied,
Proceed to trial with both parties, side by side.

ORDER
IT IS on this 15th day of August, 1996,
ORDERED that defendants’ motion be and the same hereby is DENIED.

gold_text: . Id. Presumably, defendants’ motion is premised upon Fed.R.Civ.P. 37. The Court notes, additionally, that the sanction of dismissal is particularly severe and ought to be employed only sparingly. See, e.g., Hicks v. Feeney, 850 F.2d 152, 156 (3d Cir.1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1005, 109 S.Ct. 786, 102 L.Ed.2d 777 (1989). See also Poulis v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., 747 F.2d 863, 868 (3d Cir.1984) (listing six factors to consider in imposing sanction of dismissal).
