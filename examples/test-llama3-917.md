In the case of Frey v. State, the defendant, Frey, appealed the dismissal of his federal habeas petition, which the district court held was time-barred. The court granted a certificate of appealability, and we must consider Frey's procedural default argument before proceeding to the merits of his appeal. In Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998), the Supreme Court held that a defendant's means of overcoming procedural default is more limited when asserting a Bailey claim, and the petitioner must rely on the "actual innocence" prong of the standard to overcome procedural default.

Frey argues that he was actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. To establish actual innocence, he must demonstrate that "in light of all the evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him." Bousley, 118 S.Ct. at 1611. This standard imposes a heavy burden on the petitioner. In Jones v. United States, 172 F.3d 381, the court held that a petitioner asserting a Bailey claim must rely on the "actual innocence" prong of the standard to overcome procedural default.

In this case, Frey's claim of actual innocence is based on a letter from Hanson, the victim, which states that Frey never assaulted her. The letter bears a date stamp reflecting that it was on file with the Texas state court in December 2009. Frey also provided an affidavit from his sister, Wanda Crabtree, which alleges that Hanson recanted the accusation of assault. We conclude that Frey's claim of actual innocence is sufficient to overcome procedural default and should be considered by the district court in the first instance.

We vacate the district court's judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. We express no opinion on the ultimate disposition of Frey's § 2254 petition. In accordance with 5th Cir. R. 47.5, this opinion is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.

gold_text: . It is true that our court, albeit not in the Perkins context, has sometimes decided and rejected actual innocence claims in the first instance. See e.g., United States v. Torres, 163 F.3d 909, 912 (5th Cir.1999). But see United States v. Jones, 172 F.3d 381, 385 (5th Cir.1999) (remanding for a determination of actual innocence). In the instance circumstance, we elect to allow the district court to consider Frey’s claim in the first instance. See Ram-sukh v. INS, 203 F.3d 827, 1999 WL 1234713 at *2 (5th Cir.1999) (unpublished) ("[W]e believe that sound and orderly judicial procedure counsel remand to the district court to address in the first instance the merits, if any, of the petition.").
