In assessing the admissibility of the net worth statement and the expenditures statement submitted by the Government, we observe that these documents were challenged as inaccurate and uncorroborated. However, the corroboration of Warring's statements through substantial independent evidence aligns with precedent. As stated in Smith v. United States, 348 U.S. 147, the corroboration was sufficient when the Government’s proof of Warring’s expenditures far exceeded his reported income, supporting the underreporting of income without needing to depend solely on his net worth calculations.

Additionally, the credibility of the Revenue Agents Ford and Kennedy regarding the unreliability of Warring's little black books was substantiated by their thorough verification process, reminiscent of the careful scrutiny advocated in similar cases like Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121. Furthermore, the Government’s effective cash disbursements and expenditures method, as seen in United States v. Calderon, 348 U.S. 160, 75 S.Ct. 186, handled the need for an opening cash figure with sufficient corroboration, mitigating any suspicion about their reliability.

The defense's claim that the money in the safe deposit box may belong partly to Charles Warring or other potential partners was rendered ineffective by the jury's reasonable conclusion, supported by the absence of defense witnesses to substantiate such claims, as found tenable under United States v. Johnson, 319 U.S. 503, 63 S.Ct. 1233.

Overall, the jury's verdict on these factual issues, rooted in precedential guidance (Smith v. United States, 348 U.S. 142), aligns with established legal standards. Consequently, Warring’s appeal on grounds of improperly admitted statements and uncorroborated figures lacks substantive merit.

In conclusion, the District Court's judgment stands affirmed considering the prevailing legal standards and corroborative evidence provided, consistent with previous case rulings.

gold_text: No controverted issue of fact was withdrawn from the jury and Judge Chesnut made it crystal clear that the jury was not required to accept the testimony and calculations of the Government agents, and he carefully included in his elaborate charge the precautions suggested by the Supreme Court in the very recent cases of United States v. Calderon, 348 U.S. 160, 75 S.Ct. 186; Smith v. United States, 348 U.S. 147, 75 S.Ct. 194; Friedberg v. United States, 348 U.S. 142, 75 S.Ct. 138; Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127.
