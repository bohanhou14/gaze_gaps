The cases mentioned in the reference articles provide insight into the legal framework governing compensation claims under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. Specifically, the Act provides that in any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation, it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, that the claim comes within the provisions of the Act (Section 20(a), 33 U.S.C. § 920(a)).

In Robinson v. Bradshaw, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 216, 206 F.2d 435 (1953), the court held that when a disability occurs in the course of employment, it must be presumed to have arisen therefrom, absent substantial evidence to the contrary. Similarly, in Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 330 U.S. 469, 477-478, the court emphasized that the presumption created by the Act is overcome only by substantial evidence, not by mere hypothetical probabilities.

In the instant case, the Deputy Commissioner's decision rejecting the claim for death benefits is in error as a matter of law. The record shows that the employee, William O. Steele, sought and obtained emergency hospital treatment for a work-related hernia, which was surgically repaired. The hernia was of recent origin, and the condition of the hernia sac showed that it was related to his employment. The Deputy Commissioner's finding that the hernia was caused by abnormal intra-abdominal pressure produced by intense vomiting is without evidentiary support in the record.

In light of the above, the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is granted, and the motions for summary judgment made by the defendant Deputy Commissioner and intervening defendants are denied. The claim for death benefits is compensable under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, and the Deputy Commissioner is instructed to enter an order granting compensation to the widow and children of William O. Steele.
