In this case, I concur with the Court's decision to disallow fees for the efforts of Pepper's law firm in advancing the interests of Debtor's principal, Thomas Baiun. The Court has a duty to review fee applications and ensure that the services provided were necessary and reasonably likely to benefit the estate.

The Court has correctly applied the principles set forth in 11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(4)(A) and (a)(3)(c), which require that services be reasonably likely to benefit the estate or be necessary to its administration. In this case, the services provided by Pepper's law firm did not meet this standard, and therefore, the fees should be disallowed.

The Court has also correctly applied the principles set forth in In re Busy Beaver Building Centers, Inc., 19 F.3d 833, 851, which favor full compensation to debtor's attorneys over a larger distribution to creditors. This is consistent with the policy of encouraging private enforcement of substantive rights through the judicial process.

Furthermore, the Court has correctly applied the principles set forth in 11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(6), which provide that preparation of a fee application is compensable. However, the Court's decision to disallow fees for defending the fee application is consistent with the split in the courts on this issue.

In conclusion, I concur with the Court's decision to disallow fees for the efforts of Pepper's law firm in advancing the interests of Debtor's principal. The Court has correctly applied the principles of bankruptcy law and has made a fair and reasonable decision.

gold_text: Further analysis suggests that it is customary for counsel to collect its fees and expenses for pursuing collection in a statutory fee-shifting case such as civil rights, environmental protection, and antitrust cases. This is because it is only appropriate that a wrong doer should pay the attorney for efforts that are designed to enforce a legislative statutory substantive right. Contrast this with the common-fund case where the attorney’s efforts have created a fund to be shared by his “clients.” See discussion in In re Blue Coal Corporation, 206 B.R. 721, 723 (Bankr.M.D.Pa.1997). See, also, Pawlak v. Greenawalt, 713 F.2d 972, 977 (3d Cir.1983), where in common-fund cases, such a reimbursement would necessarily benefit counsel at the expense of the beneficiaries and, normally, not be allowed. Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Carp., (Lindy II), 540 F.2d 102, 111 (3d Cir.1976) (en banc). The question becomes whether bankruptcy cases are akin to fee-shifting cases or common-fund cases. Even though the following quote dealt with a bonus request, I conclude that it has equal application when considering the legitimacy of a request that the estate bear the expense of fee litigation.
