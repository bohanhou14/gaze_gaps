The reference cases provided, such as 518 F.2d 292, 424 F.2d 14, 536 F.2d 80, and 477 F.2d 467, are relevant to the analysis of the legal cases presented. In the case of Golden Oil Company, it is essential to consider the applicability of these reference cases in determining the outcome.

It appears that the court's decision to strike Golden's defense and grant summary judgment for Exxon is supported by the record. The case law cited in the reference cases, such as Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Station KYFM, Inc. (518 F.2d 292), emphasizes the importance of affirmatively pleading affirmative defenses and the consequences of failing to do so.

In this case, Golden's failure to provide the requested information in response to interrogatories and its lack of evidence to support its claims of payment and accuracy of the Statement of Account are critical factors in the court's decision. The court's reliance on the case law, such as Olympic Ins. Co. v. H. D. Harrison, Inc. (418 F.2d 669), is also noteworthy, as it underscores the importance of presenting a detailed and accurate statement of account in support of a summary judgment motion.

Moreover, the reference cases, such as First Nat'l Bank v. Cities Serv. Co. (391 U.S. 253), emphasize the burden on the opposing party to present evidence sufficient to create a genuine dispute of fact in response to a summary judgment motion. In this case, Golden failed to meet this burden, and the court's decision is therefore justified.

In conclusion, the reference cases provide valuable guidance in analyzing the legal issues presented in this case. The court's decision to strike Golden's defense and grant summary judgment for Exxon is supported by the record and the case law, and is therefore affirmed.
