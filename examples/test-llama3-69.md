The case before us involves a search and seizure that occurred during the execution of a writ of execution. The writ authorized the seizure of certain personal property, including books and papers, from the home of Michael Bray. The search and seizure were conducted by U.S. Marshals, who were accompanied by representatives of Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette, Inc. ("PPCW"), an organization that had obtained a judgment against Bray.

The search and seizure were allegedly unreasonable and violated Bray's Fourth Amendment rights. The marshals detained Bray for four hours, during which time they denied him access to outside communications and allowed representatives of PPCW to join the search. The marshals also seized books and papers that were not authorized for seizure, including books and papers of insignificant market value.

The district court granted the marshals' motion to dismiss, holding that they were protected by qualified immunity. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed, holding that the marshals' actions were not clearly established to be unconstitutional at the time of the search and seizure.

The court of appeals cited several cases in support of its decision, including United States v. Clouston, 623 F.2d 485 (6th Cir.1980), which held that outside assistance in the execution of a warrant was permissible. The court also cited Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692 (1981), which held that detention was permissible in the context of a search for contraband.

The court of appeals also noted that the writ of execution had specifically authorized the seizure of certain personal property, including books and papers. The court held that the marshals' actions were reasonable in light of the writ and that they were protected by qualified immunity.

In conclusion, the court of appeals held that the marshals' actions were reasonable and did not violate Bray's Fourth Amendment rights. The decision was based on the court's analysis of the writ of execution and the circumstances of the search and seizure.

gold_text: An officer who was unaware that the additional representatives of PPCW were not authorized to be present might also have reasonably concluded that the individuals could film the home. Other circuits have assumed without deciding that videotaping the execution of a valid search warrant is lawful. See, e.g., Marks v. Clarke, 102 F.3d 1012, 1033 n. 37 (9th Cir.1996). In addition, several circuits have held that warrantless filming does not violate the Constitution if the cameramen are authorized to be present in the home. See United States v. Wahchumwah, 710 F.3d 862, 867 (9th Cir.2013); United States v. Brathwaite, 458 F.3d 376, 380-81 (5th Cir.2006); United States v. Davis, 326 F.3d 361, 366 (2d Cir.2003). Although here the cameraman was not authorized to be present in the Brays’ home, reasonable officers who were mistaken about the lawfulness of inviting additional representatives of PPCW to join the raid might likewise have been mistaken about whether those representatives could film the home, particularly in light of the camera’s utility in capturing the condition of the property prior to its sale. Therefore, the rights the marshals breached were not clearly established at the time of the violations.
