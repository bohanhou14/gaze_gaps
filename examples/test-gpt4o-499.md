Given our conclusion that the § 1983 claim lacks merit, we now address the district court’s decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. The district court acted within its discretion under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c), which allows a federal court to dismiss state law claims if it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction. 

As cited in 57 F.3d 1168, “if the federal claims are dismissed well before the commencement of trial, the balance of factors to be considered under the pendent jurisdiction doctrine—judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity—will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.” This aligns with the precedent in 137 F.3d 666 where the court emphasized avoiding needless decisions of state law to promote justice and comity between state courts.

Here, the foundational federal cause of action (§ 1983 claim) was dismissed before trial, tipping the balance towards non-exercise of supplemental jurisdiction. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to hear the state law claims.

Thus, we affirm the district court’s decision to dismiss the § 1983 claim for failure to state a claim and its concomitant dismissal of the supplemental state-law claims.

gold_text: Because there is no substantial constitutional claim, we also conclude that there is no federal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ state law claims, as the remaining state law claims were only argued to “be allowed to proceed ... [under] supplemental jurisdiction.” Appellant Br. 33. “As a general matter, a court will decline supplemental jurisdiction if the underlying [federal] claims are dismissed before trial.” 13D Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3567.3, at 429 (3d ed. 2007). Case law from this circuit supports this “general principle [that] the unfavorable disposition of a plaintiffs federal claims at the early stages of a suit ... will trigger the dismissal ... of any supplemental state-law claims.” González-De-Blasini, 377 F.3d at 89 (quoting Rodríguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir. 1995)). Specifically, in Camelio v. American Fed., 137 F.3d 666 (1st Cir. 1998), this court held that after the district court had dismissed a suit’s federal claims for failure to state a claim, it also “should have refrained from exercising supplemental jurisdiction over [the] state law claims and remanded them to state court.” Id. at 673.
