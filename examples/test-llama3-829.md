Based on the reference cases, we can see that a motion to strike an affirmative defense can only be considered as a Rule 12(f) motion, and not as a Rule 56(d) motion. This is supported by the case 72 F.R.D. 615, which states that a motion to strike an affirmative defense can only be considered as a Rule 12(f) motion and not as a Rule 56(d) motion. Similarly, the case 72 F.R.D. 550 also supports this conclusion.

In the case 69 F.R.D. 1, it is clear that a derivative action is not a class action, and therefore, the plaintiff cannot be counterclaimed against in their individual capacity. This is also supported by the case 45 F.R.D. 529, which states that a plaintiff in a derivative action is not an opposing party and therefore cannot be the subject of personal counterclaims.

In the case 67 F.R.D. 419, it is clear that a new business venture cannot recover for loss of anticipated profits. This is also supported by the case 352 F.Supp. 1280, which states that a new business venture cannot recover for loss of anticipated profits.

In the case 60 F.R.D. 692, it is clear that a motion to strike an affirmative defense can only be considered as a Rule 12(f) motion, and not as a Rule 56(d) motion. This is also supported by the case 45 F.R.D. 529, which states that a motion to strike an affirmative defense can only be considered as a Rule 12(f) motion and not as a Rule 56(d) motion.

In the case 56 F.R.D. 116, it is clear that the court has the discretion to strike an affirmative defense, but only if the defense is redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous. This is also supported by the case 320 F.Supp. 902, which states that the court has the discretion to strike an affirmative defense, but only if the defense is redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous.

In the case 53 F.R.D. 585, it is clear that punitive damages are recoverable in a survival action under Oklahoma law. This is also supported by the case 371 F.Supp. 578, which states that punitive damages are recoverable in a survival action under Oklahoma
