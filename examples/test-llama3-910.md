MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

The court reverses the bankruptcy court's ruling that the trustee's fraudulent conveyance claim was barred by the statute of limitations. In In re Ahead By A Length, Inc., 100 B.R. 157, 164 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1989), the court held that the trustee may bring a fraudulent conveyance action under § 544(b) as long as the state law statute of limitations has not run before the debtor's filing for bankruptcy. Similarly, in L.A. Clarke & Son, Inc. v. Donald (In re L.A. Clarke & Son, Inc.), 59 B.R. 856, 859 (Bankr.D.C.1986), the court stated that the trustee must have commenced the action within two years of his appointment or before the case was closed or dismissed, whichever occurs first.

The court also reverses the bankruptcy court's ruling that the trustee's claim for equitable subordination of Chase's lien on the debtor's property was dismissed. The doctrine of equitable subordination does not absolutely require a fiduciary relationship between the debtor and the creditor, as stated in Sinclair v. Barr (In re Mid-Town Produce Terminal, Inc.), 599 F.2d 389 (10th Cir.1979). In addition, modern case law interpreting § 510(c) and the doctrine of equitable subordination indicates that a fiduciary relationship is not a prerequisite to application of the doctrine, as stated in Benjamin v. Diamond (In re Mobile Steel Co.), 563 F.2d 692, 699-700 (5th Cir.1977).

The trustee's argument that the doctrine of equitable subordination does not require a fiduciary relationship is supported by In re Pat Freeman, Inc., 42 B.R. 224, 231 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1984), which held that "the mere absence of a fiduciary, standing alone, does not preclude application of the doctrine of equitable subordination." The court notes that the doctrine of equitable subordination is intended to prevent inequitable conduct by creditors and to ensure that creditors are treated fairly.

In conclusion, the court reverses the bankruptcy court's rulings that the trustee's fraudulent conveyance claim was barred by the statute of limitations and that the trustee's claim for equitable subordination of Chase's lien on the debtor's property was dismissed.
