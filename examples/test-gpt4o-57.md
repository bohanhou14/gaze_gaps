**Generation:**

We find Defendant's arguments unpersuasive. In line with United States v. Perez, 585 F.3d 880, 883 (5th Cir.2009), the district court’s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed de novo, and its factual findings for clear error. The PSR’s reliance on testimony and taped conversations to substantiate Defendant’s perjury aligns with established standards (640 F.3d 638). Furthermore, the district court found sufficient evidence of Defendant's willful intent to provide false testimony regarding the nature of the money received (253 F.3d 815). Given our deference to the district court’s credibility determinations, particularly in matters of conflicting testimony, we conclude there was no clear error in imposing the obstruction of justice enhancement.

AFFIRMED.

gold_text: We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in imposing an enhancement for obstruction of justice. While Defendant focuses on the conflict between his testimony and the FBI testimony regarding his alleged admission, he fails to address the fact that the PSR also relied on taped conversations in which Defendant repeatedly discussed receiving money but never referenced a loan. Furthermore, Defendant’s suggestion that a perjury finding can only be based on tape-recorded or independently verified inconsistent statements is contrary to the law. Although Defendant is correct to identify that United States v. McCauley involved a conflict between one defendant’s trial testimony and his own prior recorded statements, McCauley does not hold or even suggest that a perjury finding requires inconsistencies to be memorialized on tape. See 253 F.3d 815, 821 (5th Cir.2001). To the contrary, this court has several times upheld a finding of perjury under § 3C1.1 in light of contradictory testimony from other witnesses at trial. See, e.g., United States v. Flores, 640 F.3d 638, 644 (5th Cir.2011) (finding that defendants’ assertions were “not worthy of credence” because they were “flatly contradicted, by other witnesses”); United States v. Montelongo, 539 Fed.Appx. 603, 606 (5th Cir.2013) (per curiam) (concluding that the district court’s finding of false testimony was not clearly erroneous in light of directly contradictory testimony). In any event, Defendant’s argument on this point similarly fails to account for the conversations Defendant had, which were tape-recorded, in which he discussed payments but never suggested such payments were loans.
