In the case of 71 F.3d 885, the court established that a "Glomar response" is a response to a FOIA request that neither confirms nor denies the existence of responsive records. This response is used when an agency believes that confirming or denying the existence of records would reveal sensitive information. In the case at hand, the FBIHQ's response to plaintiff's request for records about Mr. Brathwaite and Mr. Hodge was a Glomar response, as it neither confirmed nor denied the existence of responsive records.

However, the court in 546 F.2d 1009 held that a Glomar response is not a valid basis for withholding records under FOIA. The court stated that an agency's failure to confirm or deny the existence of records is not a sufficient basis for withholding records, and that the agency must provide a public justification for its decision to withhold records. In this case, the FBIHQ's Glomar response is insufficient, and the court should not grant summary judgment to the agency.

Furthermore, the court should also consider the public interest in disclosure. As stated in United States Dep't of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773, 109 S.Ct. 1468, 103 L.Ed.2d 774 (1989), the public has a right to know what their government is up to, and disclosure of records can serve a significant public interest. In this case, the public interest in disclosure outweighs the agency's interest in withholding records, and the court should order the agency to release the records.

In conclusion, the court should deny the agency's motion for summary judgment and order the agency to release the records responsive to the FOIA request. The agency's Glomar response is insufficient, and the public interest in disclosure outweighs the agency's interest in withholding records. <answer>

gold_text: If an individual is the target of a FOIA request, the agency to which the FOIA request is submitted may provide a “Glomar” response: the agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records or information responsive to the request on the ground that even acknowledging the existence of responsive records constitutes an unwarranted invasion of the targeted individual’s personal privacy. See Nation Magazine v. United States Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885, 893 (D.C.Cir. 1995); Phillippi v. Central Intelligence Agency, 546 F.2d 1009, 1014-15 (D.C.Cir. 1976). Citing such privacy concerns, the FBIHQ, EOUSA and DEA neither confirmed nor denied the existence of records pertaining to Mr. Brathwaite and Mr. Hodge on the ground that their disclosure without the subjects’ written authorization could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of their personal privacy.
