The question of whether the district court's order is final for purposes of appeal to the courts of appeals is a crucial one. In the case of 745 F.2d 1153, the court held that the order of the bankruptcy judge rejecting the bank's complaint was final within the meaning of the appeal statute, but only if the district court's order reversing the bankruptcy judge was also final. Similarly, in 751 F.2d 806, the court held that the bankruptcy judge's decision was not final because it did not conclusively determine the dispute regarding the DOE's claim.

In this case, the bankruptcy judge's order permitted the trustee to file an objection to the amount of the DOE's claim, thereby creating the possibility that further proceedings would be necessary to determine the DOE's claim. The amount owed the DOE will not be conclusively determined until the DOE's claim has been either allowed or disallowed. Therefore, the bankruptcy judge's decision is not final within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 158(d).

Furthermore, the order does not qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order exception of the final judgment rule of 28 U.S.C. § 1291, assuming without deciding that that exception also applies to appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d). For immediate appeal under this exception, the order must conclusively determine the disputed question, resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment. Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2457, 51 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978).

Therefore, this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the DOE's appeal and the appeal should be dismissed. The bankruptcy judge's decision is not final, and the district court's order reversing the bankruptcy judge is also not final. The DOE's claim has not been conclusively determined, and further proceedings are necessary to determine the amount owed the DOE.

gold_text: . Section 1293, however, was never formally effective. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549 (1978), which repealed the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, added section 1293 but delayed its effective date. Until that date, title IV of the 1978 Act, Pub.L. No. 95-598, §§ 401-411, 92 Stat. 2682-2688 (1978), as amended by Pub.L. No. 98-325, § 1(a), 98 Stat. 268 (1984), provided for a "transition period" during which jurisdiction to hear appeals was conferred on the courts of appeals "the same as the jurisdiction” granted by 28 U.S.C. § 1293. See Pub.L. No. 95-598, § 405(c)(2), 92 Stat. 2685 (1978) (codified at 28 U.S.C. note preceding § 1471). The 1984 Amendments, however, did not expressly repeal § 1293. See 1984 Amendments §§ 113 and 121(a). If there is any ambiguity in how Congress disposed of § 1293, it is clear that § 1293 was implicitly repealed by the enactment of 28 U.S.C. § 158. See In re Riggsby, 745 F.2d 1153, 1155 (7th Cir.1984) (they “are worded virtually the same, and appear to have the same meaning, so that although the 1984 amendments do not expressly repeal section 1293(b), we think they must be held to do so by implication____” (citation omitted)); In re Exclusive Industries Corp., 751 F.2d 806, 807 & n. 1 (5th Cir.1985).
