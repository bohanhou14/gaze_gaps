In the context of the legal cases, the issue of overbreadth is a crucial consideration in evaluating the constitutionality of a regulatory scheme. The doctrine of overbreadth seeks to prevent the government from coercing citizens into self-censorship by allowing facial challenges to licensing schemes that grant unbridled discretion to public officials (City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ'g Co., 486 U.S. 750, 755-59, 108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988)). In the case of 36 C.F.R. ยง 251.56(a)(2)(vii), the Forest Service's regulatory scheme for noncommercial group use of National Forest System land was found to be overbroad on its face (Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989)).

However, the doctrine of overbreadth is not absolute and can be narrowed by construing the regulation to eliminate its overbroad aspects (Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990)). In the instant case, the Forest Service's interpretive rule clarifies the scope of 36 C.F.R. ยง 251.56(a)(2)(vii) by limiting the permissible range of terms and conditions to those that pertain to health, safety, the environment, land-use management, and the minimization of damage to National Forest System resources (64 Fed.Reg. 48,959 (1999)). This narrowing construction renders the regulatory scheme constitutional, as it is now content-neutral, narrowly tailored to serve specified government interests, and leaves open ample alternatives for communication (Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 129-130, 112 S.Ct. 2395, 120 L.Ed.2d 101 (1992)).

In conclusion, the regulatory scheme for noncommercial group use of National Forest System land, as construed by the Forest Service's interpretive rule, is constitutional and does not violate the First Amendment. The rule's content-neutral and narrowly tailored approach, combined with its availability of alternative means of communication, ensures that the regulation is consistent with the principles

gold_text: Relying on a recently promulgated interpretive rule to construe 36 C.F.R. ยง 251.56(a)(2)(vii) as constitutionally valid, however, raises a due process problem for Defendants. Although the Forest Service filed the information against Defendants in July 1998, the Forest Service did not promulgate the interpretative rule until September 1999. See 64 Fed.Reg. 48,959 (1999). The regulation thus gave Defendants inadequate notice about the danger of being successfully prosecuted under this newly and narrowly construed regulatory scheme. See Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 115, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990). Under such circumstances, to permit the government to proceed with its prosecution of Defendants would create a chilling effect on challenges to laws that potentially encroach upon the freedom of speech. See Shuttlesworth, 394 U.S. at 151, 89 S.Ct. 935; see also Massachusetts v. Oakes, 491 U.S. 576, 586, 109 S.Ct. 2633, 105 L.Ed.2d 493 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring). We therefore affirm the dismissal of the information.
