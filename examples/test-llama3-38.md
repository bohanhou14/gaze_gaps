In reviewing the case, it is clear that the petitioner's likelihood of success on the merits of his contract claim is minimal. The plain language of the enlistment contract does not indicate that Mr. Tremblay was being guaranteed a position in the JAGC. Additionally, the delay agreement and letter from an Army official put petitioner on notice that he was not assured of a JAGC position. The cases cited by petitioner, such as Pence v. Brown, 627 F.2d 872 (8th Cir.1980), are distinguishable from the instant case on a number of grounds.

In Pence, there was evidence beyond the plaintiff's allegations that misrepresentations were actually made, and the plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations in deciding to enlist. In contrast, there is no evidence in the instant case beyond petitioner's uncorroborated allegations that any oral representations concerning a JAGC position were made to him or that he relied on any such representations.

Furthermore, the enlistment contract in the instant case, unlike that in Pence, clearly and specifically put petitioner on notice that he was not promised a specific duty assignment in the Army. The supplemental delay agreement also clearly could not have led petitioner to believe he was promised a specific duty assignment given its conjunctive reference to a duty assignment "consistent with post-graduate subject discipline and military requirements" (emphasis added).

In conclusion, based on the evidence presented, it is clear that the petitioner's likelihood of success on the merits of his contract claim is minimal. The court's findings and conclusions are supported by the trial court's findings and are not clearly erroneous. The judgment is therefore affirmed.

gold_text: In the instant case I find no basis, other than petitionerâ€™s allegations, to conclude that any fraud or misrepresentations were practiced upon him in connection with his enlistment in the Army. I also find that the agreements petitioner entered into with the Army clearly did not promise him a JAGC position upon graduation from law school and admission to the bar. Furthermore petitioner, a college and law school student, had the capacity to read and understand these agreements. In the absence of fraud or imposition, Chalfant v. Laird, 420 F.2d 945 (9th Cir.1969), non-negligent or negligent misrepresentations, Pence v. Brown, 627 F.2d 872 (8th Cir. 1980), or ambiguity in the agreements themselves, Dubeau v. Commanding Officer, 440 F.Supp. 747 (D.Mass.1977), petitioner is bound by the contents of the agreements. It is therefore unlikely, for the purposes of this motion, that petitioner will succeed on the merits of his contract claim.
