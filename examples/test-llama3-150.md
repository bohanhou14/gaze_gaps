 I'd be happy to help you with that. Here is the written-up case:

<answer>

We affirm Baird's conviction and sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).

First, we reject Baird's claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he possessed a firearm. In Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Supreme Court held that a person has been convicted of burglary for purposes of the ACCA if he is convicted of any crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.

Next, we find no merit in Baird's claim that § 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional. In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008), the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation. We have also held that § 922(g)(1) is a constitutional avenue to restrict the Second Amendment right of convicted felons. United States v. Rozier, 598 F.3d 768, 771 (11th Cir.2010).

Furthermore, we disagree with Baird's claim that his prior convictions for second-degree burglary and third-degree burglary do not constitute "violent felonies" for purposes of the ACCA. In 544 U.S. 13, the Supreme Court held that a conviction under a non-generic burglary statute is a violent felony if the defendant was actually found guilty of the elements of a generic burglary. We have also held that a conviction under a non-generic burglary statute is a violent felony if the defendant was actually found guilty of the elements of a generic burglary. United States v. Palomino Garcia, 606 F.3d 1317, 1328 (11th Cir.2010).

Finally, we are unpersuaded by Baird's claim that the district court plainly erred in failing to recognize an affirmative "safekeeping" defense to § 922(g). In 600 F.3d 1326, we held that

gold_text: A conviction under a non-generic burglary statute still qualifies as a “burglary” under the ACCA if the defendant was actually found guilty of the elements of generic burglary. Id. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. In determining whether a conviction under a non-generic burglary statute qualifies as generic burglary, courts employ the “modified categorical approach,” which allows the court to determine which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by consulting the trial records, including charging documents. Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); United States v. Sneed, 600 F.3d 1326, 1330-32 (11th Cir.2010). We have held that a defendant’s previous third-degree burglary convictions in Alabama counted for ACCA purposes because the indictments charged the defendant with burglary of the “building of Richie’s Shoe Store, Inc.” and “building of, to wit: Whiddon’s Gulf Service Station,” which, as a shoe store and service station, respectively, were places that generally fell within the scope of generic burglary. United States v. Rainer, 616 F.3d 1212, 1216 (11th Cir.2010).
