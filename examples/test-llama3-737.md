Based on the provided case, the taxing authority has the ultimate burden of proof in the bankruptcy forum. This is evident from the "Chevron" instructs that if the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation. Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute. (Reference: 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)).

In the provided case, the Medicare and Medicaid fractions are proxies for low-income patients. The Medicare proxy counts Medicare recipients who are entitled to supplemental security income (SSI), while the Medicaid proxy counts patients who are not entitled to Medicare benefits but who qualify for Medicaid. The language in the Medicaid proxy, "the fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the number of the hospital's patient days for such period which consist of patients who (for such days) were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under [the Medicaid program], but who were not entitled to benefits under part A of [the Medicare program], and the denominator of which is the total number of the hospital's patient days for such period," (Reference: 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(II)) clearly indicates that the Medicaid proxy counts patients who are eligible for medical assistance under a State plan.

The legislative history of the statute and the policy considerations underlying the bankruptcy code also support the conclusion that the Medicare and Medicaid fractions are proxies for low-income patients. The statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, and therefore, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute. The agency's answer is not permissible, as it would conflict with the clear congressional intent.

In conclusion, the taxing authority has the ultimate burden of proof in the bankruptcy forum, and the Medicare and Medicaid fractions are proxies for low-income patients. The Medicaid proxy counts patients who are eligible for medical assistance under a State plan, and the agency's answer is not permissible as it would conflict with the clear congressional intent.

gold_text: Three sister circuits agree with us. The Ninth, Eighth and Sixth Circuits all hold that the Secretary’s interpretation of the Medicaid proxy does not comply with congressional intent as expressed in the statute and is therefore impermissible. Legacy Emanuel Hosp. & Health Center v. Shalala, 97 F.3d 1261 (9th Cir.1996); Deaconess Health Servs. Corp. v. Shalala, 83 F.3d 1041 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (affirming 912 F.Supp. 438 (E.D.Mo.1995)); Jewish Hosp., Inc. v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 19 F.3d 270 (6th Cir.1994). In sum, “[w]e believe the language of the Medicare reimbursement provision is clear: the Medicaid proxy includes all patient days for which a person was eligible for Medicaid benefits, whether or not Medicaid actually paid for those days of service.” Legacy Emanuel Hosp., 97 F.3d at 1265.
