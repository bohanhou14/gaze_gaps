Please provide the reference case numbers for a better understanding. Based on the provided information, it appears that the petitioner is challenging his conviction and sentence. He claims that he was deprived of his constitutional rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

In the case of Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993), the Supreme Court held that a habeas petitioner must demonstrate that he is "actually innocent" and that his claim of innocence is not merely a speculative or hypothetical possibility. The Court also emphasized that the standard for granting relief is high and that the burden is on the petitioner to demonstrate that he is innocent.

In the case of Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298 (1995), the Supreme Court held that a habeas petitioner must demonstrate that he is "actually innocent" and that his claim of innocence is not merely a speculative or hypothetical possibility. The Court also emphasized that the standard for granting relief is high and that the burden is on the petitioner to demonstrate that he is innocent.

In this case, the petitioner has filed a habeas petition claiming that he was deprived of his constitutional rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. He claims that he was denied a fair trial and that his sentence was imposed in violation of his constitutional rights.

In order to determine whether the petitioner's claims are meritorious, the Court must first determine whether he has exhausted his state remedies. The petitioner must have filed a post-conviction motion in state court and then exhausted all available state remedies before filing a federal habeas petition.

If the petitioner has exhausted his state remedies, the Court must then determine whether his claims are meritorious. In order to prevail, the petitioner must demonstrate that he is "actually innocent" and that his claim of innocence is not merely a speculative or hypothetical possibility.

The Court must also consider the respondent's arguments and determine whether the petitioner's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The respondent argues that the petitioner's claims are time-barred because they were filed outside of the one-year statute of limitations.

The Court must also consider the petitioner's claims of innocence and determine whether they are supported by the evidence. The petitioner claims that he was denied a fair trial and that his sentence was imposed in violation of his constitutional rights.

Based on the information provided, it appears that the petitioner's claims are supported by some evidence, but the Court must carefully consider

gold_text: The respondent contends that the gravamen of the petitioner’s second motion presents a free-standing claim of actual innocence, which is insufficient to constitute a “federally cognizable claim” under Austin. The respondent cites Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993), for that proposition, and argues therefore that the petitioner’s post-conviction motion does not qualify as such under Section 2244(d)(1). In Herrera, the Supreme Court reviewed a lower court ruling that dismissed a death row inmate’s second habeas petition in which he claimed that it was not he, but his now-deceased brother, who had committed the murder in that case. The Court held that a claim of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence alone does not state a federal constitutional claim. Id. at 400, 113 S.Ct. 853. “Few rulings would be more disruptive of our federal system than to provide for federal habeas review of freestanding claims of actual innocence.” Id. at 401, 113 S.Ct. 853. The Court clarified its position in Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995), explaining that actual innocence claims are relevant in federal habeas proceedings not as independent claims for relief, but as a justification to overcome procedural obstacles to consideration of other federal constitutional violations that rendered a trial unfair. The Court distinguished between a freestanding, substantive claim of actual innocence and a procedural claim of actual innocence. See id. at 314, 115 S.Ct. 851.
