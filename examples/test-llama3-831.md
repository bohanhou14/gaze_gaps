In this case, the court's review of the contract documents reveals that the contract required plaintiff to construct Types I, II, and IV guardwalls using the total precast method of construction, as mentioned in reference case 467 F.2d 1323. The contract provisions, including section 615 of the SCR and plan sheets 206-08, consistently suggest or depict totally precast units, and the lifting method described in subsection 615.03 of the SCR recommends lifting points for a fully integrated unit, not one that is partially precast.

The parties' understanding of the contract is also clear. The solicitation, award, bid schedules, and subcontract all consistently label Types I, II, and IV guardwalls as precast concrete, not stone masonry. The parties understood at the time they entered into the agreement that this was what the contract strictly required.

Plaintiff's proposed partial precast method constituted a change to the contract that should have been submitted as a VECP, as mentioned in reference case 467 F.2d 1323. The court finds that plaintiff failed to strictly comply with the contract and is precluded from relief.

In conclusion, the court concludes that the contract required plaintiff to construct Types I, II, and IV guardwalls using the total precast method of construction, and that plaintiff's proposed partial precast method constituted a change to the contract that should have been submitted as a VECP. The court grants defendant's motion for summary judgment and dismisses plaintiff's complaint.

United States, 41 Fed.Cl. 585, 591 (1998). “[H]ow the parties act under the arrangement, before the advent of controversy, is often more revealing than the dry language of the written agreement by itself.” Macke Co. v. United States, 199 Ct.Cl. 552, 467 F.2d 1323, 1325 (Ct.Cl.1972). In the instant case, plaintiffs understanding during the bidding process and at the time of contracting is key to whether it is entitled to relief. The most compelling indicator of plaintiffs understanding during this critical time comes from the plain language of the subcontract, because the terms were discussed and agreed upon during the bidding process and prior to issuance of the award.
