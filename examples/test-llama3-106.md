Based on the reference cases, it appears that the court's jurisdiction is limited to the state of New Hampshire, where the land to be condemned is located. The United States District Attorney, Alexander Murchie, is the proper party to represent the government in the condemnation proceedings, and service of process may be made upon him (Milwaukee & Minnesota R. Co. v. Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co., 2 Wall. 609, 633, 17 L. Ed. 886; Higgins v. California Prune & Apricot Growers, 282 F. 550).

In this case, the plaintiff, Alfred E. Fish, is seeking to enjoin the condemnation proceedings and to obtain discovery of the facts surrounding the selection of the site for the post office. However, the court finds that the allegations in the petition do not demonstrate any illegality or unconstitutional action by the government or its agents (United States v. McIntosh, 2 F. Supp. 244).

The court notes that the government has followed the statutory requirements in selecting the site, and that the Secretary of the Treasury has acted in good faith and in a legal manner. Therefore, the court will not grant permission for substituted service upon Morgenthau, Farley, and Cummings, as the bill does not demonstrate any necessity or propriety for such action (Krippendorf v. Hyde, 110 U. S. 276, 4 S. Ct. 27, 28 L. Ed. 145).

In conclusion, the court finds that the government has properly followed the statutory requirements in selecting the site for the post office, and that the condemnation proceedings may proceed as planned. The court will not grant permission for substituted service upon Morgenthau, Farley, and Cummings, and the petition for injunction and bill for discovery will be dismissed.

As, for instance, if they were acting under an unconstitutional act or in manner otherwise than in accordance with law, or were seeking to condemn property already devoted to public uses.
