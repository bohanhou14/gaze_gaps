In support of the district court's reasoning, we reference the principle established in Leon (475 U.S. 335), which emphasizes that an officer’s reliance on a magistrate’s probable cause determination and the express terms of a warrant should ordinarily be viewed as objectively reasonable. However, the concept of qualified immunity requires that an officer’s actions be deemed reasonable only if a well-trained officer would have believed the warrant to be valid (Leon, supra, at 923).

Despite the procedural uprightness, we must examine whether the officers had an objectively reasonable belief that probable cause existed when securing the warrant. In 774 F.2d 716, the court affirmed that good faith reliance on a teletype message did not negate the requirement of probable cause. Similarly, alleged misstatements or omissions in the affidavits could negate probable cause if they were intentionally or recklessly made (738 F.2d 538). If an affidavit includes false information critical to establishing probable cause, applying the ruling from 438 U.S. 154, the veracity of the affidavit must be impeached, which calls for a judicial review rather than mere assumption of trust.

Thus, if Yancey's arrest warrant included misleading information or significant omissions, it undermines the probable cause and warrants further scrutiny. This assessment justifies potential remand for further evaluation of the officers’ objective good faith and the integrity of their affidavits.

gold_text: Police officers are entitled to rely on a judicially secured warrant for immunity from a § 1983 action for illegal search and seizure unless the warrant is so lacking in indicia of probable cause, that official belief in the existence of probable cause is unreasonable. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1098, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986). Thus, an officer cannot rely on a judicial determination of probable cause if that officer knowingly makes false statements and omissions to the judge such that but for these falsities the judge would not have issued the warrant. See Donta v. Hooper, 774 F.2d 716, 718-19 (6th Cir.1985); U.S. v. Mankani, 738 F.2d 538, 545 (2nd Cir.1984) (citing Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 165, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2681, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978)).
