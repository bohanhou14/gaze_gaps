In reviewing the jurisdictional amount, it is essential to consider the intent of Congress in drastically restricting federal jurisdiction in controversies between citizens of different states. As stated in Reference case 303 U.S. 283, the sum claimed by the plaintiff controls, unless the law gives a different rule. In this instance, the plaintiff's demand for $10,750.00 is clearly in excess of the jurisdictional amount, and it must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal.

Further, Reference case 367 U.S. 348 highlights the importance of considering the amount originally claimed before the State Compensation Board, and whether it appears or is in some way shown that the amount stated in the complaint is not claimed "in good faith." However, in this case, there is no indication that the amount claimed is not in good faith, and the plaintiff's demand for $10,750.00 is a legitimate claim.

In conclusion, the defendant's assertion that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the jurisdictional amount is unfounded, and the case should proceed as originally filed. The Court will not dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction, and will instead continue to hear the merits of the dispute. <answer>

gold_text: Although it is unnecessary, under the federal rules, to state with any degree of specificity the circumstances underlying oneâ€™s cause of action, of the exact amount in controversy, where it appears to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount the complaint must be dismissed. St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Company, 303 U.S. 283, 289, 58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938); Horton v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, 367 U.S. 348, 81 S.Ct. 1570, 6 L.Ed. 2d 890 (1961). The plaintiff argues that the claim for unlawful infringement may itself exceed the jurisdictional requirements of this Court. He asserts, however, that inasmuch as the records are all within the control of the defendant, it is impossible to establish with any degree of certainty the actual amount to which he is entitled.
