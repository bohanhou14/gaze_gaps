In this case, the discretion of the directors in managing the affairs of the corporation and deciding on dividends is paramount and generally uncontrollable by the courts unless fraud or bad faith is evident. As held in the case cited as 10 S. Ct. 1057, "a dividend shall be made, and if made, how much it shall be, and when and where it shall be payable, rest in the fair and honest discretion of the directors uncontrollable by the courts." Similarly, there is no cause to question the discretion exercised by the directors of the Wisconsin Syndicate in retaining earnings or utilizing them for capital improvements. The directors' actions in reserving profits for an addition to capital, as discussed in 34 L. Ed. 525, were deemed lawful and within their business judgment: "the corporation may distribute its earnings at once to the stockholders as income; or it may retain portions of its earnings and allow them to accumulate, and then invest them in its own works and plant."

The master's report and the court’s findings do not present any evidence of bad faith or improper conduct by the directors. The alleged excess receipts retained were utilized prudently for taxes, general expenses, and improvements, all reflecting sound business decisions. Thus, the plaintiff's demand for forced dividend payments from excess receipts or the sale of capital assets seeks to challenge the legitimate business judgment and discretion of the directors, which the courts are not inclined to interfere with. Given the absence of any fraudulent or unfair conduct, the decisions of the directors stand affirmed.

Therefore, the dismissal of the plaintiff's bill is warranted, reaffirming the directors' discretion in their business decisions regarding retained earnings and dividend declarations.

gold_text: As to whether dividends shall or shall not be declared is left to the board of directors. Cook on Corporations (8th Ed.) § 545, states the general rule thus: “When, therefore, the directors have exercised this discretion and refused to declare a dividend, there will be no interference by the courts with their decision, unless they are guilty of a willful abuse of their discretionary powers, or of bad faith or of a neglect of duty. It requires a very strong case to induce a court of equity to order the directors to declare a dividend, inasmuch as equity has no jurisdiction, unless fraud or a breach of trust is involved.” Eletcher, Cyclopedia Corporations, § 3656, deduces the same rule from the adjudications. The reasons for the rule are obvious. In addition to the lack of power, except on the condition named, it would be intolerable that corporate businéss should be constantly under the threat of extraneous interference on the complaint of every stockholder because of his dissatisfaction with the policy of the management. The rule on the subject is not different from the statement of it by Cook, supra, when the issue is between a life tenant and remainderman to the shares. That question was presented to the Supreme Court in Gibbons v. Mahon, 136 U. S. 549, 10 S. Ct. 1057, 34 L. Ed. 525.
