In the case of Shekoyan v. Sibley Int'l Corp., 496 U.S. 384, the Supreme Court held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not extend to non-U.S. citizens employed overseas. The court relied on the "longstanding principle of American law 'that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.'" Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).

The court also held that the False Claims Act (FCA) does not provide whistleblower protection for an employee who reports suspected fraud to a supervisor without making a good faith effort to investigate the matter further. Shekoyan's own deposition testimony showed that he did not conclude that there was corruption, but rather thought there were some issues that needed to be addressed. This lack of a good faith effort to investigate the matter further meant that his reporting of suspected fraud did not constitute protected conduct under the FCA.

Finally, the court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Shekoyan's pendent claims under District of Columbia law after disposing of all of the federal claims. The court considered the factors of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity and concluded that it would not be adverse to Shekoyan's ability to pursue his claims in the local court system.

In conclusion, the court's decisions in this case were based on the principles of statutory interpretation and the requirements of the False Claims Act. The court's holdings were consistent with previous precedent and did not involve any novel or controversial issues. Shekoyan's claims were dismissed because they did not meet the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.

gold_text: Shekoyan also contests two procedural orders issued by the district court during the course of the litigation. The first is the district court’s refusal to permit Shekoyan to file a motion for summary judgment after the deadline for filing dis-positive motions. Order, Case No. 00-2519 (February 3, 2004) (summary judgment order). The second is the district court’s denial of Shekoyan’s motion for Rule 11 sanctions against Sibley’s lawyers. Order, Case No. 00-2519 (February 17, 2004) (Rule 11 Order). We review both orders for abuse of discretion. See Atchinson v. District of Columbia, 73 F.3d 418, 424 (D.C.Cir.1996) (reviewing denial of motion to amend complaint for abuse of discretion); Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990) (“[A]n appellate court should apply an abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of a district court’s Rule 11 determination.”). In the Rule 11 context, we note that a district court “would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” Id.
