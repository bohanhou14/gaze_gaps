Louisell further contends that the cumulative effect of the alleged errors warrants habeas relief. We acknowledge that cumulative errors, even if individually harmless, can act to deprive a defendant of fair trial rights. See United States v. Rivera, 900 F.2d 1462, 1469 (10th Cir.1990) (en banc); see also 93 F.3d 479 (addressing reevaluation of sentencing in light of cumulative evidence). However, upon reviewing the record and the arguments presented, we find that the individual claims of error, which we have already determined to be without merit, do not collectively rise to the level of denying Louisell a fair trial.

Moreover, precedent informs us that procedural defaults in state courts preclude federal habeas review unless the defendant can show cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991); see also 21 F.3d 309 (providing insights on trial court procedures). Louisell has not demonstrated such cause or prejudice, nor has she shown that the alleged errors have resulted in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. 

Therefore, we uphold the district court’s denial of Louisell’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

III.

For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the district court.

gold_text: Finally, Louisell contends that the prosecuting attorney deliberately pursued information previously suppressed by the trial court during the examination of several witnesses. Trial errors warrant habeas relief when the prosecutor’s actions are improper and have “prejudicially affected the defendant’s substantial rights so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.” United States v. Thomas, 93 F.3d 479, 487 (8th Cir.1996). “In evaluating whether a trial error resulted in prejudice to the defendant, we consider the cumulative effect of such misconduct, the strength of the properly admitted evidence of the defendant’s guilt, and the curative actions taken by the [trial] court.” Id. In this case, there is no evidence that the prosecutor attempted to elicit information suppressed by the trial court in willful disregard of the trial court’s order. The Iowa Court of Appeals found that one of the answers was unanticipated by the prosecution and another answer was merely cumulative of evidence already admitted. Moreover, the trial court properly sustained Louisell’s objections to improper questions and immediately admonished the jury to disregard the statements. Considering the strength of the state’s evidence and the curative instructions provided by the trial court, we conclude that no constitutional violation occurred. See United States v. Turk, 21 F.3d 309, 313 (8th Cir. 1994); Thomas, 93 F.3d at 487.
