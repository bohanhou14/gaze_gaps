**Generation:**

Like the petitioner in reference case **488 F.3d 1371**, Liu argues that changed circumstances in China merit reopening his removal proceedings. In the **568 F.3d 1252** case, the court highlighted prima facie eligibility for asylum based on new facts such as forced sterilization. However, in Liu's situation, his evidence did not sufficiently demonstrate a substantial change in country conditions since the original removal order.

The Board meticulously reviewed Liu's evidence and, similar to the approach in **568 F.3d 1252**, assessed the credibility of submitted affidavits and reports. The unsigned family planning letter and supporting affidavits were deemed unreliable, lacking proper authentication, paralleling the skepticism noted in **488 F.3d 1371** regarding forged documents. Furthermore, the distinction in treatment between U.S.-born and Chinese native-born children, supported by precedents including **568 F.3d 1252**, undermined Liu's claim. Consequently, the Board's reliance on State Department reports and established jurisprudence to deny reopening Liu's case was neither arbitrary nor an abuse of discretion. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the BIA and deny the petition for review.

gold_text: Liu relies on two Eleventh Circuit cases — Yaner Li v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 488 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.2007), and Xue Xian Jiang v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 568 F.3d 1252 (11th Cir.2009) — in support of the opposite position. These cases are distinguishable because, on both occasions, the Board did not find that second-hand reports from the petitioner of stepped-up family planning practices in Fuijan Province lacked credibility. Xue Xian Jiang, 568 F.3d at 1258, Yaner Li, 488 F.3d at 1375. This evidence indicated a change in regional implementation of the one-child policy sufficient to allow the petitioners’ cases to be reopened. By contrast, in Liu’s case, the Board found the specific evidence submitted by Liu’s family in China to be untrustworthy. It gave the evidence “little weight” in making its determination. A.R. 6; see also Xiao Jun Liang, 626 F.3d at 991 (relying on the incredible nature of petitioner’s secondhand evidence as a reason to distinguish her case from Yaner Li and Xue Xian Jiang). To the extent the Eleventh Circuit decisions are on point, most courts have limited them to their facts, and we decline to depart from the rulings set forth in the majority of other circuits.
