...law in the absence of direct guidance from state courts, thereby avoiding unnecessary intrusions into state sovereignty. Given that federal courts have broad discretion in deciding whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims (196 F.3d 617), it is prudent to decline jurisdiction when the remaining claims raise novel or complex issues of state law, which is one of the enumerated reasons under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(1) (137 F.3d 885).

Considering the Sixth Circuit's position that a district court has the discretion to decline supplemental jurisdiction when all federal claims are dismissed (235 F.3d 275), and in light of the immunity issues under Tennessee law that the state courts have yet to address (203 F.3d 937), the court must carefully evaluate whether retaining jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ MOC claims would serve judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity (196 F.3d 617).

Here, the claims involve interpretations of Michigan statutory provisions without clear precedent. Given these factors, and the principles set forth in cited cases, the court opts to dismiss plaintiffs’ state law claims without prejudice, allowing them to pursue these matters in a more appropriate state forum where novel legal questions can be addressed with the necessary expertise and consideration (937 F.2d 738).

Accordingly, the federal claims are adjudicated as per the findings in this opinion, and the state claims under the Michigan Occupational Code are dismissed without prejudice.

gold_text: The statutory basis for this court’s supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims is established by 28 U.S.C. § 1367. Section 1367(a) states that, “Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.” In turn, subsection (c)(1) provides that a district court “may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if-(i) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law.” “[Djistrict courts have broad discretion in deciding whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.” Pinney Dock & Transp. Co. v. Penn Cent. Corp., 196 F.3d 617, 620 (6th Cir.1999). The Sixth Circuit reviews district court decisions whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under an abuse of discretion standard. See Weeks v. Portage County Executive Offices, 235 F.3d 275, 279 (6th Cir.2000); Campanella v. Commerce Exch. Bank, 137 F.3d 885, 892 (6th Cir.1998). The district court’s discretion is informed by factors of judicial economy, convenience, fairness and comity. 196 F.3d at 620. When facing novel or complex state law, district courts are to be cognizant that there may be “nuances” of state law better left for resolution in the first instance by the state courts. See Cooper v. Parrish, 203 F.3d 937, 953 (6th Cir.2000); see also Drew v. University of Tennessee Regional Medical Center Hosp., No. 99-5070, 2000 WL 572064, at *5 (6th Cir. May 1, 2000) (finding that it was “entirely appropriate for the district court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction” over a claim raising a novel question of state law). The “obscurity or paucity of pertinent state judicial precedent [ ] argue[s] in favor of deferring in favor of the state courts.” Scott v. Long Island Sav. Bank, FSB, 937 F.2d 738, 742 (2d Cir.1991).
