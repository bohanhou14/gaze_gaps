The case of United States v. Jones involves a revocation of supervised release hearing, where the defendant, Jones, argued that his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination was violated because he was forced to testify at the hearing before the adjudication of the state charges that formed the basis of the revocation request. Jones relied on United States v. Sackinger, 537 F.Supp. 1245, 1250 (W.D.N.Y.1982), which suggested that the government's delay in initiating probation-violation proceedings until after the resolution of the underlying state charges amounts to deprivation of the defendant's right to a speedy hearing.

However, the Supreme Court has identified the key inquiry in determining whether a violation of the right against compelled self-incrimination has occurred as "whether the accused was deprived of his free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer." Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 496, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 562 (1967). In this case, Jones was not compelled to testify, and he had the choice to attack the government's case by presenting other evidence, including hearsay testimony.

Jones also argued that the district court erred in not demanding that Karin and Officer Moreland's wife testify at the revocation hearing, instead receiving hearsay evidence from Officer Moreland. However, the district court concluded that the hearsay testimony of Officer Moreland was admissible under the present sense impression and excited utterance exceptions to the hearsay rule. We review admissibility determinations for abuse of discretion, and we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in admitting Officer Moreland's hearsay testimony under either of these exceptions.

In conclusion, Jones's Fifth Amendment claim was rejected because he was not deprived of his free choice to admit, deny, or refuse to answer, and his Sixth Amendment claim was rejected because the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Officer Moreland's hearsay testimony under the present sense impression and excited utterance exceptions to the hearsay rule.

gold_text: The hearsay testimony offered in Chin did not appear to fall within any exception to the hearsay rule; neither was there any discussion in Chin of the applicability of hearsay exceptions. See id. at 123. This is significant because it is well established that where the government seeks to introduce testimony under the excited utterance exception, and where that testimony is properly admitted by the district court, the government is under no constitutional obligation to explain the unavailability of the hearsay declarant. See White v. Illinois, 502 U.S. 346, 353-358, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (ruling that Confrontation Clause does not require showing of witness unavailability where hearsay statements of witness were admissible under “spontaneous declaration” exception); Tocco, 135 F.3d at 128 (applying White to uphold admission of “excited utterance” without showing of unavailability); see also United States v. Inadi, 475 U.S. 387, 394-98, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986) (holding that showing of witness unavailability was not required under Confrontation Clause for admission of out-of-court statements made by co-conspirators); Reardon v. Manson, 806 F.2d 39, 41 (2d Cir.1986) (“The unavailability rule ... was developed in a series of cases in which the prosecution offered written records of prior testimony in place of live testimony at trial, and the rule should not be extended mechanically to other factual contexts.”). Consequently, Chin’s requirement that the district court consider “the government’s grounds for not allowing confrontation” does not apply to the instant case. But, even if we were to consider this prong of the Chin test, we accept the validity of the government’s stated reasons for not calling the hearsay declarants. First, with regard to the teenage girl Karin, her age and the sexual nature of the testimony she would be required to give furnish ample justification for the government’s decision not to call her. Second, with regard to both eyewitnesses, Jones’s history of violent conduct made reprisal against them a possibility. There was no error in the district court’s acceptance of those reasons.
