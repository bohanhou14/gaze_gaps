Furthermore, Rushing's negligence claim relies upon the assertion that the BOP failed to provide timely surgical intervention. As stated in Ochran v. United States, under the FTCA, the plaintiff must allege a violation of state law duty to succeed in a negligence claim (273 F.3d 1315; see also Ochran I, 117 F.3d at 504 n. 6). Here, Rushing's assertion that the delay caused his prolonged suffering does not sufficiently demonstrate the BOP violated a specific state law duty.

Additionally, the district court’s application of Alabama law aligns with the requirements under the FTCA, which mandates that the law of the state where the act or omission occurred be applied. As indicated in the case Richards v. United States, the whole law of the state drives the process (378 F.3d 1229; see also Richards, 369 U.S. at 11).

In conclusion, although Rushing's FTCA complaint was filed within the two-year statute of limitations, it fails to establish the essential elements of a negligence claim pursuant to the applicable state law. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of summary judgment.

gold_text: With respect to Rushing’s medical malpractice and negligence claim, it must be determined which state’s law applies. Lia bility under the FTCA for “personal injury caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government,” should be determined “in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.” 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1); see also Ochran v. United States, 273 F.3d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir.2001). Because the United States is the defendant, the FTCA “requires that the ‘whole law of the State where the act or omission occurred!,]’ including its choice of law rules, be applied.” Gonzalez-Jiminez De Ruiz v. United States, 378 F.3d 1229, 1230 n. 1 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted). As Rushing was in Mississippi on January 23, 2003, when he possessed the critical facts of his injury and its cause, Mississippi’s choice of law rules provisions apply. See id. In this case, under its choice of law provisions, Mississippi would apply its own substantive law. See Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Goodwin, 920 So.2d 427, 432-33 (Miss. 2006).
