The cases presented demonstrate the importance of summary judgment and the need for concrete particulars to support a party's claims. In case 585 F.2d 31, the court emphasized the need for a party to set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial, rather than relying on mere allegations or denials.

Similarly, in case 523 F.2d 461, the court found that the plaintiff's response to the defendant's motion for summary judgment was insufficient, as it only presented a compendious replica of the complaint and promised to offer evidence at trial.

In case 594 F.2d 923, the court dismissed the plaintiff's claim due to the lack of a legitimate claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 or a similar analysis of general constitutional claims.

In case 576 F.2d 453, the court ruled that the plaintiff had abandoned any claims that did not involve alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985(2), and 1985(3).

Finally, in case 619 F.2d 932, the court found that the defendant had not acted with actual malice in the Sullivan-St. Amant sense, as it had made a thorough investigation of the facts and used a responsible methodology in preparing the article.

In light of these cases, it is clear that a party must provide concrete particulars to support their claims and must be prepared to demonstrate a genuine issue for trial. Failure to do so may result in a summary judgment against the party.

However, when a motion for summary judgment is made and supported, as it was in this case, the opposing party may not rest upon mere conclusory allegations or denials. SEC v. Research Automation Corp., 585 F.2d 31, 33 (2d Cir. 1978). A plaintiff does not become entitled to a jury trial simply by asserting a cause of action in which the defendant’s state of mind is a material element. Hahn v.
