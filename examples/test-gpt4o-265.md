Given the partial preemption identified, the severability of the California Act becomes pertinent. The severability clause within Measure B indicates a presumption that the remaining provisions should stand even if one provision is invalidated (see Measure B § 8, referenced in 774 F.3d 566). Under California law, the invalid provision must be "grammatically, functionally, and volitionally separable" (Cal. Redev. Ass’n, referenced in 774 F.3d 566). 

Grammatical separability is met if the invalid parts can be removed without affecting the coherence of what remains, suggesting that excising provisions specific to the employee's own sickness or injury while retaining others would suffice (People v. Nguyen, referenced in 774 F.3d 566). Functionally, the California Act’s provisions related to family care and protection from violence can operate independently from those preempted by RUIA, maintaining the Act’s integrity and purpose in part (Barlow v. Davis, referenced in 774 F.3d 566).

Volitionally, there is no indication that the legislature would not have enacted the valid provisions independently, thus satisfying this criterion as well. The reasonable requirements of the state's minimum labor standards do not conflict with the federal preemption domain as upheld in both the broader congressional purpose and legislative context (referencing 271 U.S. 500, which emphasizes the reasonableness and necessity of state regulation not unduly interfering with federal law).

Moreover, in line with the doctrine forbidding unbridled discretion (486 U.S. 750), the court will not impose non-binding limitations or rewrite the statute’s reach but rather adhere to expressed standards of severability and preemption embedded within both RUIA and the California Act, acknowledging their distinct but harmonious legislative intents.
