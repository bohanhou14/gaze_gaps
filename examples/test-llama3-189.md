**Generation:**



The court must determine whether the defendant has purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of the state's laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before the state's court foreseeable. In this case, the defendant has purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities in Massachusetts by applying for re-registration of the trademark in 1993 and by placing advertisements in the Boston Globe and selling merchandise in the state.

The court must also consider the Gestalt factors, which include the plaintiff's burden of showing that the defendant has minimum contacts with the forum state, the defendant's purposeful availment of the forum state's laws, and the reasonableness of the exercise of jurisdiction. In this case, the plaintiff has shown that the defendant has minimum contacts with the forum state, and the defendant has purposefully availed himself of the forum state's laws. The exercise of jurisdiction is also reasonable in light of the defendant's activities in Massachusetts.

The court finds that the defendant has purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities in Massachusetts and that the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable. Therefore, the court has jurisdiction over the defendant with respect to the claims alleging fraud by the defendant in seeking re-registration of the trademark in 1993.

In these circumstances, as a matter of law, the defendant should have anticipated the likelihood of being haled into court in Massachusetts. See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980). See also National Patent Dev. Corp. v. T.J.

Furthermore, defendant’s acts leading to re-registration in 1993 were indisputably voluntary. See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985).
