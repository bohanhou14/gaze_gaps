The court's decision to deny discharge of the debt to FNB is supported by the cases of In re Rose, 934 F.2d 901 and In re Jardula, 934 F.2d 901. In In re Rose, the court held that the definition of larceny for § 523(a)(4) purposes is a matter of federal common law. Similarly, in In re Jardula, the court held that the preponderance of the evidence standard applies to all exceptions from dischargeability of debts contained in Bankruptcy Code § 523(a).

In the case at hand, the court found that Mortensen did not embezzle the funds because he was the project manager and had the authority to make decisions about how the funds were to be used. The court also found that Mortensen's actions were not willful and malicious, as he was acting in good faith and attempting to complete the construction project.

The court's conclusion that the debt was not discharged is also supported by the case of Little Family Farms Corporation v. Mortensen, 882 F.2d 302. In that case, the court held that a debt is not discharged unless the creditor proves that the debt was incurred by the debtor's willful and malicious injury to or conversion of the creditor's property.

In conclusion, the court's decision to deny discharge of the debt to FNB is supported by the cases of In re Rose, In re Jardula, and Little Family Farms Corporation v. Mortensen. The court found that Mortensen did not embezzle the funds, but rather was acting in good faith and attempting to complete the construction project. The court also found that the debt was not discharged because the creditor did not prove that the debt was incurred by the debtor's willful and malicious injury to or conversion of the creditor's property.

gold_text: A Chapter 7 discharge does not discharge debt for embezzlement or larceny. 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4). Little Family argues the two claims alternatively, conceding that they are inconsistent claims. Larceny is the wrongful taking of property from the rightful owner with fraudulent intent to convert the property to the debt- or’s own use. Kaye v. Rose (Matter of Rose), 934 F.2d 901, 903 (7th Cir.1991); Dynamic Food Service Equipment, Inc. v. Stern (In re Stern), 231 B.R. 25, 26 (S.D.N.Y.1999). Embezzlement is the “fraudulent appropriation of property of another by a person to whom such property has been entrusted or into whose hands it has lawfully come.” First National Bank of Fayetteville, Arkansas v. Phillips (In re Phillips), 882 F.2d 302, 304 (8th Cir.1989). The funds at issue were deposited into a bank account in Mortensen’s name. He was authorized to use the funds in the construction of the Little Family homes. Therefore, the claim of larceny will be dismissed, and the § 523(a)(4) claim will be analyzed under the theory of embezzlement.
