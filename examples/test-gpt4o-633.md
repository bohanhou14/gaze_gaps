**Generation:**

In light of the due process violations and substantial prejudice faced by Kouropova, it is essential to evaluate her case under the appropriate legal standards. As established in *Batanic v. INS*, 12 F.3d 662, 667 (7th Cir.1993), the remedy for ineffective assistance includes remanding the case for a hearing based on the law at the time of the original hearing (212 F.3d 518). Similarly, in *Campos-Sanchez v. INS*, 164 F.3d 448, 450 (9th Cir.1999), it was determined that any remedy inconsistent with due process cannot stand (212 F.3d 518).

Moreover, Kouropova’s testimony and the evidence of her well-founded fear of persecution should be reassessed per current standards of asylum law. Similar to the findings in *Smolniakova’s* case, where the IJ's presumption of a well-founded fear was not substantially rebutted (422 F.3d 1037), Kouropova's fear of persecution should be given full consideration.

Finally, the argument that changes in Armenia over time mitigate the objective basis for her fear is untenable. As in *Salazar-Paucar v. INS*, it is fundamentally unfair for the BIA to use its administrative delay against Kouropova (439 F.3d 1100). The Government should not benefit from its delays, and the IJ’s errors, which contributed to the extended period Kouropova spent in limbo, solidify the case for remand and reevaluation under due process standards.

Therefore, we remand Kouropova's case to the BIA for a fair hearing, consistent with the legal precedents and due process requirements.

gold_text: 4. Because the extreme delay was the fault of the government, we remand to the BIA with instructions to determine in the first instance whether Kouropova was eligible for asylum given the facts and law as they existed in 1994. “Any other remedy would be inconsistent with the due process guarantees afforded to aliens in deportation proceedings.” See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 528 (9th Cir.2000) (remanding with instructions to apply the law in place before the due process violation occurred). On remand, because the BIA has already found Kouropova’s testimony credible, it must accept the facts of her testimony as true. See Singh v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 1100, 1112 (9th Cir.2006); Smolniakova v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 1037, 1048 (9th Cir.2005).
