To state a claim under § 1985(3), plaintiffs must show a conspiracy involving invidious, racial, or class-based discriminatory animus (Reference case 463 U.S. 825). The Supreme Court in the Griffin case emphasized that § 1985(3) targets private conspiracies without State involvement, provided there is class-based discriminatory animus (Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88).

In the current matter, plaintiffs have alleged discrimination based on political affiliation. The Court of Appeals in Reference case 706 F.2d 377 acknowledged that political discrimination suffices for § 1985(3) claims, especially where rooted in class-based animus. However, plaintiffs’ allegations here are conclusory and lack substantive evidence of discriminatory actions taken due to political affiliation. More importantly, the corporate plaintiff, Yale Auto Parts, Inc., cannot reasonably claim political affiliation, undermining the conspiracy claim.

Without concrete evidence of a conspiracy motivated by political animus, the plaintiffs' § 1985(3) claim cannot stand. As with the prior claims, this final federal claim must also be dismissed. Accordingly, defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings concerning the § 1985(3) claim is granted.

Scott, 463 U.S. 825, 103 S.Ct. 3352, 77 L.Ed.2d 1049 (1983), tilted toward finding that § 1985(3) could encompass politically-based discrimination, the complaint fails to satisfy the earlier and clear ruling of Keating v. Carey, 706 F.2d 377, 386-88 (2d Cir.1983). There, our Court of Appeals held that the allegations of a New York civil servant, active in Republican party affairs, (a) that he was informed that he would be removed from his tenured post once the Democratic administration of Governor Carey took office, (b) that he was so removed, and (c) that he was subsequently and wrongly misled to believe that he enjoyed no tenure rights in the first place, satisfied the Griffin requirement under § 1985(3) of a proscribed discriminatory animus based on his affiliation as a Republican. The court held:
