Appellant's reliance on the timing of his involvement in the conspiracy does not absolve him of the conspiracy’s scope. As established in Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171 (1987), and reaffirmed in secondary rulings like the 10th Circuit case, 839 F.2d 1387, hearsay statements can be considered when supported by substantial independent evidence of the conspiracy’s existence. In 483 U.S. 171, it was noted that even if individual statements might be unreliable, taken as a whole and corroborated by independent evidence, they establish the conspiracy's validity.

The district court in this case mirrored the procedure in 839 F.2d 1387 by grounding the admissibility of co-conspirator statements in substantial, independent evidence of the conspiracy. Here, the trial court reviewed an array of evidence, including financial transactions obscured by the Levine law firm, defendant's active participation in meetings discussing fraudulent use of pension funds, and subsequent efforts to conceal these activities. Thus, even if some co-conspirator statements predated appellant's direct involvement, his later actions corroborate his integration into the ongoing conspiracy.

In line with the logic in 483 U.S. 171, the trial court was correct in its judgment that the totality of evidence sufficiently established the conspiracy’s contours and the appellant’s role within it. Therefore, the admission of co-conspirator hearsay statements was justified under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), backed by substantial corroborating evidence as required by Rule 104(a).

In sum, our examination upholds the trial court’s application of legal standards concerning co-conspirator statements. The conviction on all counts is thus supported by sufficient evidence, both direct and circumstantial, reflecting a deliberate and knowing participation in defrauding the United States.
