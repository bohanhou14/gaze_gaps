Next, the Court addresses Defendants' Rule 12(b)(1) challenge regarding Plaintiffs' standing to bring this action. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs lack standing because they did not sufficiently allege an injury caused by the other Boomarang locations. The Court treats this as a facial challenge, where, as established in reference cases 807 F.3d 169 and 264 F.3d 1195, the court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Additionally, the Supreme Court in Lujan emphasized that each element of standing must be supported in the same manner as any other matter where the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, a standard echoed in both reference cases (807 F.3d 169, 264 F.3d 1195).

Here, Plaintiffs allege a joint employment relationship among all Boomarang locations. Specifically, they claim shared employee services, a common payroll system, joint control over employment conditions, and common managerial oversight. These factual allegations, taken as true, sufficiently demonstrate that Plaintiffs' work benefited all Boomarang locations, thus supporting a joint employment theory and satisfying the standing requirements under Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6). Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss on these grounds is denied.
