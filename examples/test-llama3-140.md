The concept of attorney's fees in bankruptcy cases is governed by the Bankruptcy Code, case law, and local rules. In determining the reasonableness of attorney's fees, the court must consider factors such as the prevailing market rate for similar services, the time reasonably expended, and the results obtained. In Norman v. Housing Authority of Montgomery, 836 F.2d 1292 (11th Cir.1988), the court adopted the lodestar approach, which involves calculating the reasonable hourly rate and multiplying it by the hours reasonably expended.

In the cases at hand, the Trustee objected to the attorney's fees claimed by Mr. Royals, which were based on a flat fee of $1,500. The Court found that the fees were unreasonable and sustained the objection. The Court noted that while the "no look" fee provision in the Local Rules may have been intended to simplify the process, it has led to the establishment of a standard fee for Chapter 13 cases, which may not be reasonable in all cases.

The Court concluded that a fee of $1,000 was reasonable in each of the three cases, based on the prevailing hourly rate of $150 and the minimal services required in a Chapter 13 case. The Court noted that the "no look" fee provision has led to a lack of fee competition in the marketplace, which has resulted in higher fees for debtors. The Court's decision is consistent with the principles set forth in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974), which emphasizes the importance of considering the reasonableness of attorney's fees in bankruptcy cases.

In conclusion, the determination of attorney's fees in bankruptcy cases involves a multifaceted analysis of the prevailing market rate, the time reasonably expended, and the results obtained. The Court's decision in this case highlights the importance of ensuring that attorney's fees are reasonable and proportionate to the services rendered, and that the "no look" fee provision does not lead to unfair and abusive practices.
