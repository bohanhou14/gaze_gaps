In the case presented, the court is faced with a motion to dismiss brought by defendant Dermott, alleging that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims brought against him. The court must determine whether supplemental jurisdiction applies to the state law claims against Dermott.

In Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869), the Supreme Court held that jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause. Similarly, in Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U. S. 574, 584 (1999), the Court emphasized that even jurisdiction over the person is an essential element of the jurisdiction of a district court, without which the court is powerless to proceed to an adjudication.

In this case, the court has original jurisdiction over the federal claims against the Wiest defendants, but supplemental jurisdiction is required to determine the relationship between the federal claims and the state law claims against Dermott. The court must determine whether the central facts of the federal claims are also the central facts of the state law claims.

After reviewing the claims, the court concludes that the breach of contract claim and the misappropriation of trade secrets claim are not related to the federal claims and do not share a common nucleus of operative facts. In Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the existence of supplemental jurisdiction is predicated on the existence of a substantial federal claim and a common nucleus of operative fact as to state and federal claims.

Therefore, the court will exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the conspiracy to injure another claim against Dermott, as it is related to the federal claims against the Wiest defendants and shares a common nucleus of operative facts. However, the breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets claims will be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

gold_text: Although the Wiest defendants have not filed any motions yet, federal district courts have an independent obligation to insure that subject matter jurisdiction exists. See, e.g., Wild v. Subscription Plus, Inc., 292 F.3d 526 (7th Cir.2002). Where subject matter jurisdiction is lacking, the court may dismiss a lawsuit on its own motion. Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 778, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000) (“Questions of jurisdiction, of course, should be given priority— since if there is no jurisdiction there is no authority to sit in judgment of anything else.”). Because I have already concluded that this court lacks supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim of misappropriation of trade secrets, I will dismiss this claim in its entirety as to all three defendants.
