A first amendment claim regarding the denial of religious expression warrants careful consideration. Under the precedent set in Hill v. Blackwell, 774 F.2d 338, prison regulations that limit constitutional rights must show that the exercise of the restricted right could pose a potential threat to legitimate penological objectives. The review must ensure that such regulations are not exaggerated responses and are grounded in reasonableness. Similarly, Turner v. Safley articulated the standard that regulations impinging on constitutional rights are valid if "reasonably related to legitimate penological interests" (856 F.2d 1120). This involves considering factors such as rational connections to governmental interests, alternative means of exercising rights, potential ripple effects, and the existence of ready alternatives.

Thus, for future proceedings, it is essential that the district court rigorously applies these standards. If evidence suggests the regulation is an exaggerated response or lacks reasonableness, deference to prison officials is diminished, necessitating judicial scrutiny to justify the restrictive measure.

Additionally, concerning the eighth amendment claims, changes ameliorating conditions like enhanced staffing and improved lighting and monitoring should be given due weight. If practices such as double celling behind boxcar doors have been terminated, rendering parts of the complaint moot, it is crucial these developments are documented and addressed in the final adjudication.

In conclusion, while the expertise of prison officials warrants deference, it must be balanced against maintaining constitutional protections, ensuring no rights are unduly compromised and that improvements in prison conditions are acknowledged and verified.

While, in evaluating a district court’s determinations concerning the reasonableness of prison regulations that impinge on constitutional rights this court’s review of the ultimate legal conclusion is plenary, Hill v. Blackwell, 774 F.2d 338, 343 (8th Cir.1985), it is important that our decision be limited to relevant facts.
