**Generation:**


In this scenario, we have a situation where the United States Court of Federal Claims (COFC) and the District Court are involved. The District Court dismissed the claim of the plaintiff, Ms. Griffin, under the Equal Pay Act (EPA) and transferred the claim to the COFC. The COFC dismissed the claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1500, which bars the COFC from having jurisdiction over any claim that is pending in another court.

The issue at hand is whether the COFC has jurisdiction over Ms. Griffin's EPA claim, which was transferred from the District Court. The COFC has held that the bar of § 1500 applies "only when the suit shall have been commenced in the other court before the claim was filed in [the COFC]." However, in United States v. County of Cook, 170 F.3d 1084, 1089 (Fed.Cir.1999), the court held that simultaneously-filed claims are as a matter of law "pending" with respect to each other for purposes of § 1500. This rule is problematic because it conflicts with binding precedent of this court and ignores the role of § 1631, which is intended to cure want of jurisdiction and allow unwary litigants who file in the wrong courts to avoid technical obstacles.

In this case, Ms. Griffin's claim was transferred from the District Court to the COFC, but the COFC dismissed the claim under § 1500, citing the County of Cook rule. This outcome is unjust because it deprives Ms. Griffin of a forum for her legitimate EPA claim against the government. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit should overturn the rule in County of Cook and hold that the COFC has jurisdiction over Ms. Griffin's EPA claim, which was transferred from the District Court.
