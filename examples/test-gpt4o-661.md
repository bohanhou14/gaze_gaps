The Second Circuit has emphasized that FOIA's exemptions are to be interpreted narrowly and disclosure is favored, as highlighted in Dep’t of the Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532 U.S. 1, 7 (2001). Furthermore, the FOIA mandates the disclosure of records held by a federal agency unless the documents fall within enumerated exemptions (463 F.3d 239).

In this context, NRDC's FOIA request demonstrates their proven ability to disseminate information effectively, echoing the principles of public accountability (NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. at 242). Courts reviewing such requests adhere to a de novo standard, ensuring that partial production might still align with FOIA’s intended transparency (312 F.3d 70).

The EPA’s assertion that the documents requested are overly broad does not nullify the significant public interest in the subject matter of the request. The extent to which governmental interaction with private entities influences policy decisions is paramount for public awareness (312 F.3d 70).

Given the NRDC’s comprehensive history in engaging in environmental law and the significant contribution this request aims to offer to public understanding, a fee waiver is justifiable for the pertinent portion of their request, aligned with the core tenets of FOIA (463 F.3d 239).

gold_text: . The Second Circuit has opined on the FOIA fee waiver provision in only one case: Carney. The Second Circuit has evidenced a willingness to look to the law of other circuits— particularly the D.C. Circuit — in the area of FOIA, even when it has not specifically adopted other circuits’ law. See, e.g., Inner City Press/Community on the Move v. Bd. of Governors of Federal Reserve Sys., 463 F.3d 239, 244-45 (2d Cir.2006); Tiguev. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 312 F.3d 70, 77-78 (2d Cir.2002); Carney, 19 F.3d at 814.
