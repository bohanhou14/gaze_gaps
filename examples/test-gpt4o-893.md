The principles set forth in prior cases confirm that the doctrine of sovereign immunity precludes Beneficial’s claim against the IRS under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). Specifically, the FTCA permits claims against the United States "in the same manner and to the same extent" that claims would lie against private individuals (28 U.S.C. § 2674). However, exceptions apply, such as those for claims arising out of misrepresentation or deceit (28 U.S.C. § 2680(h)), as affirmed in United States v. Neustadt, 366 U.S. 696 (1961).

In Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. v. United States, 431 U.S. 666, 669-70 (1977), the Supreme Court held that the FTCA’s waiver of immunity is limited and reaffirmed the misrepresentation exception. The Supreme Court's decision in Block v. Neal, 460 U.S. 289, 296-97 (1983) further solidifies this by holding that the FTCA does not cover claims arising out of misrepresentation.

Moreover, the FTCA provides that the government’s liability is analogous to that of private individuals under state law (United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 340 U.S. 543, 547 (1951)). Hence, if Beneficial’s claim against the IRS is fundamentally based on alleged misrepresentations made by IRS officials, it falls squarely within the misrepresentation exception of the FTCA.

Given these precedents and statutory interpretations, Beneficial’s claim against the IRS does not fit within the FTCA’s waiver of sovereign immunity. Therefore, we must affirm the district court’s dismissal of Beneficial's claim against the IRS.

gold_text: Beneficial at times characterizes the above-quoted claim not only as a fraud claim but also as a claim for contribution or indemnification. The FTCA’s waiver of sovereign immunity normally encompasses claims for contribution or indemnification where the law of the relevant state would hold a private individual liable for contribution or indemnification in the same circumstances. See, e.g., Lockheed Aircraft Co. v. United States, 460 U.S. 190, 196-98, 103 S.Ct. 1033, 1037-38, 74 L.Ed.2d 911 (1983); United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 340 U.S. 543, 546-52, 71 S.Ct. 399, 402-404, 95 L.Ed. 523 (1951). Claims for contribution or indemnity against the government are prohibited, however, when permitting the claims to go forward effectively would defeat the purposes of a particular exception to the government’s waiver of sovereign immunity. See Stencel Aero Eng’g Corp. v. United States, 431 U.S. 666, 673-74, 97 S.Ct. 2054, 2058-59, 52 L.Ed.2d 665 (1977) (private party liable in tort to a military serviceman could not recover from federal government under a contribution or indemnification theory because permitting the claim would defeat the purposes behind the government’s immunity against the serviceman’s direct claim).
