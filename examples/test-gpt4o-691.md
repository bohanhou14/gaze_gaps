The Plaintiffs' second cause of action alleges a violation of the Student's right to privacy under New York Civil Rights Law § 50-b, asserting that the Defendants disclosed confidential information pertaining to the Student's sexual abuse history. The Defendants contend that § 50-b does not provide a private right of action, and even if it did, the federal court should decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction as per the principles set out in United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966).

In addressing pendent jurisdiction, the Supreme Court established in Gibbs that a federal court has jurisdiction over state-law claims that derive from a "common nucleus of operative fact" with the federal claims. The federal claims must have substance sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction, and the entire action must be considered as one constitutional "case." Although the Plaintiffs' claims under § 50-b stem from the same set of facts, the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction is discretionary, focusing on judicial economy, convenience, and fairness to litigants (383 U.S. 715).

In Carnegie-Mellon University v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343 (1988), the Court further clarified that when federal-law claims are dismissed early in litigation, a district court has the discretion to remand the pendent state-law claims to state court. Here, the federal claims have been dismissed with prejudice, thereby influencing the decision to possibly remand the remaining state-law claims.

Hence, while the state and federal claims may derive from the same facts, the discretionary nature of pendent jurisdiction, as discussed in Gibbs and affirmed in Cohill (484 U.S. 343), justifies the dismissal of the state-law claim under § 50-b. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs’ second cause of action is dismissed without prejudice, allowing them to pursue any potential remedies in state court.

gold_text: In addition to alleging a violation of the Student’s constitutional privacy rights, the Plaintiffs also claim a violation of the Student’s right to privacy under § 50-b of the New York Civil Rights Law. Under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, where the state and federal claims derive from a common nucleus of operative fact such that it would ordinarily be expected that they would all be tried in one judicial proceeding, federal courts have the constitutional power to exercise jurisdiction of the state law claims as well as the federal claims. See e.g. United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). However, 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) gives a district court the discretion not to exercise pendent jurisdiction when it has dismissed all of the claims over which it had original jurisdiction. Further, the Supreme Court in Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988), announced that when all federal claims are eliminated in the early stages of litigation, the balance of factors generally favors declining to exercise pendent jurisdiction over remaining state law claims and dismissing them without prejudice. Id. at 350, 108 S.Ct. 614. Therefore, in light of the determination that the Plaintiffs’ have not stated a viable federal claim under 1983, this Court declines to exercise jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs’ § 50-b claim. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs’ second cause of action is hereby dismissed without prejudice.
