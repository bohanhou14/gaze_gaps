In reviewing the cases provided, it is clear that the definition of "disability" under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a crucial factor in determining whether an individual is protected under the law. In the case of Kelly v. Sorrell, 94 F.3d 102, the court held that an individual must show that their impairment substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of the individual to be considered disabled under the ADA.

In the case at hand, it appears that Plaintiff's back injury was a temporary condition that did not substantially limit his ability to perform major life activities. According to the regulations promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under the ADA, an impairment substantially limits a major life activity if it is "unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform" or "significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform the same major life activity." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i) and (ii).

In Dutcher v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, 53 F.3d 723, the court held that an impairment that affects only a narrow range of jobs can be regarded either as not reaching a major life activity or as not substantially limiting one. Similarly, in this case, Plaintiff's back injury did not substantially limit his ability to perform major life activities, and therefore, he cannot be considered disabled under the ADA.

Based on the facts of this case, it appears that Plaintiff's claim for disability discrimination under the ADA is without merit. Therefore, I recommend that the Court grant Defendant's motion for summary judgment.

gold_text: However, this Court concludes that such treatment is insufficient to establish that Plaintiff is “disabled,” i.e. that he is “substantially limited in one of his life activities.” Plaintiff lists his inability to among other things “carry groceries, mow his lawn and wash his dog” as evidence of his disability. However, this Court interprets the term “substantially” to require far greater limitation on Plaintiff’s ability to “perform manual tasks.” A physical impairment, standing alone, is not necessarily a disability as contemplated by the ADA. Kelly v. Drexel Univ. 94 F.3d 102, 108 (3rd Cir.1996) citing Dutcher v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, 53 F.3d 723, 726 (5th Cir.1995). To rise to the level of a disability, an impairment must significantly restrict an individual’s major life activities. Impairments that result in only minor limitations are not disabilities. 2 EEOC Compliance Manual § 902, 902-19.
