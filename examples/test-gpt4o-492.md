In the present case, the issue of whether BCL unequivocally intended to be bound by the Master Contract negotiated by NYSA is pivotal. As established in previous cases, the courts have consistently held that a clear and unequivocal intention by employer members to be bound by group actions in collective bargaining is sufficient for the binding nature of such agreements. In NLRB v. Beckham, Inc., 564 F.2d 190, 192 (5th Cir. 1977), it was highlighted that the employer's unequivocal intention is key to being part of the bargaining unit (reference case 632 F.2d 171).

Additionally, the court in NLRB v. Dover Tavern Owners’ Ass’n, 412 F.2d 725, 727 (3d Cir. 1969) reaffirmed that the intent to be bound by the bargaining group's actions is a test employed by the Board and approved by the courts (reference case 632 F.2d 171). Given BCL’s long-standing membership in NYSA since 1979 and its failure to withdraw prior to the 1996 contract negotiations, it is clear that BCL expressed an unequivocal intention to be bound by the Master Contract.

Moreover, the Board’s finding regarding the continuation of a single-employer bargaining history until the execution of a multi-employer agreement is relevant here. In reference case 44 F.3d 136, the Board reasonably found that the history of single-employer bargaining transitioned into a period of coordinated bargaining, which continued to bind the parties involved. Thus, BCL remained bound by the Master Contract negotiated by NYSA, and the district court’s summary judgment in favor of ILA and NYSA aligns with this precedent.

In conclusion, BCL's binding by the Master Contract and the validity of the arbitration award are supported by substantial evidence and align with established legal principles. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

New York Typographical Union, No. 6, 632 F.2d 171, 183 (2d Cir.1980). “The Board has consistently held that the essential element warranting the establishment of multi-employer units is clear evidence that the employers unequivocally intend to be bound in collective bargaining by group rather than individual action.” Id. (citations and quotations omitted). “[T]he presumption that a single- employer bargaining unit is appropriate can be overcome only by ‘clear evidence that the employers unequivocally intend to be bound in collective bargaining by group rather than by individual action.’ ” NLRB v. 1115 Nursing Home & Serv. Emp. Union, 44 F.3d 136, 138 (2d Cir.1995) (per curiam), quoting New York Typographical Union, No. 6, 632 F.2d at 183. However, mere agreement to bargain as a group is insufficient; there must be actual bargaining on that basis. See 1115 Nursing Home & Serv. Emp. Union, 44 F.3d at 138. Here, BCL was a member of NYSA from 1979 until its formal resignation on June 20, 1996. By virtue of its membership in the association, BCL granted NYSA authority to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with the ILA. Actual bargaining on a multi-employer basis took place while BCL was a member of NYSA. BCL was bound by the resulting agreements, including the 1996 Master Contract, which included the containerization provisions. Therefore, the district court correctly held that no issue of fact existed regarding BCL’s intent to be bound by the multi-employer Master Contract. Because the Containerization Agreement within that contract was a valid work preservation clause directed at the primary employment relationship, the contract was legal and Judge Keenan correctly held that Section 8(e) does not prohibit confirmation and enforcement of the arbitration award.
