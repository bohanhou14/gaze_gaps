Additionally, the defendant's motion for a new trial challenges the conduct of the presiding judge during the trial. Sorrentino's counsel asserts that the judge overstepped by expressing his opinion on the facts in an argumentative manner, ultimately suggesting the defendant's guilt. This aligns with the concerns in the case referenced as 57 F.2d 822, where it was noted that the judge's emphasis on the respondent’s lack of veracity potentially deprived the appellant of a fair trial. However, the judge in this case did remind the jury that his opinions should not control theirs.

Another point raised pertains to communication during the investigation. In 295 U.S. 78, the informal nature of interactions between investigative parties was scrutinized. Similarly, in this case, the defense contends that the government’s presentation of certain testimonies and declarations was prejudicial. Despite objections, this evidence was admitted under established principles of agency and conspiracy (Cr.Code, § 332, 18 U.S.C.A. § 550).

Having reviewed these contentions and considering precedents like Affronti v. United States, 145 F.2d 3, and United States v. Toscano, 166 F.2d 524, the court finds the jury's verdict to be well-founded with substantial evidence. Thus, the defendant’s motion for a new trial on these grounds is denied. The jury's impartiality and the admissibility of evidence were maintained in accordance with legal standards.

gold_text: In our charge to the jury we read the counts in the indictment and the provisions of the respective sections of the statutes involved, and by way of explanation we advised the jury that defendant Sorrentino could not be found guilty unless defendants Kobli and Sorrentino acted in order to make the transportation possible and to have the victim go to Buffalo; that they must have acted to induce her to go into interstate commerce to be a prostitute before the act of her actually going into interstate commerce; .that Sorrentino was not being tried for what he did after the victim’s arrival in Buffalo. We explained the difference between the Federal and State offenses. Shama v. United States, 8 Cir., 1938, 94 F. 2d 1, certiorari denied 304 U.S. 568, 58 S. Ct. 1037, 82 L.Ed. 1533; Malaga v. United States, 1 Cir., 1932, 57 F.2d 822. No additional requests for charge were made on behalf of defendant Sorrentino. Exception was made by counsel for defendant Kobli and joined in by counsel for defendant Sorrentino because the court had allegedly placed undue emphasis on Count 2, i. e., the charge of inducing to go into interstate commerce to become a prostitute. The part of the charge as to the testimony of accomplices was in the usual form as to caution and corroboration. No additional requests were made in this regard. See Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 81, 82, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314, interpreting Section 269 of-the Judicial Code, as amended. 28 U.S.C.A. § 391.
