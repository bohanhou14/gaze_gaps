In the context of this case, the court's failure to provide a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction was not an abuse of discretion. The court's decision was based on the legal theory that the school district's actions were not motivated by Murray's out-of-class advocacy of Learnball, but rather by the desire to control her use of the method in the classroom. The court's findings of fact and conclusions of law were supported by the record, and the court did not fail to make findings when required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a).

As stated in Professional Plan Examiners of New Jersey, Inc. v. LeFante, 613 F.2d 1235, a hearing is not necessary when the movant has not presented a colorable factual basis to support the claim on the merits or the contention of irreparable harm. Similarly, in 793 F.2d 533, we held that a decision may be based on affidavits and other documentary evidence if the facts are undisputed and the relevant factual issues are resolved.

In this case, Murray's claims of retaliation and First Amendment violations were not supported by sufficient evidence to warrant a hearing. The court's denial of the preliminary injunction was not an abuse of discretion, as the court's findings were supported by the record and the court did not fail to make findings when required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a).

In contrast, in 309 U.S. 310, the court held that a party may be entitled to a hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction if the movant has presented a colorable factual basis to support the claim on the merits or the contention of irreparable harm. However, in this case, Murray's claims were not supported by sufficient evidence to warrant a hearing.

In conclusion, the court's failure to provide a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction was not an abuse of discretion. The court's decision was based on the legal theory that the school district's actions were not motivated by Murray's out-of-class advocacy of Learnball, but rather by the desire to control her use of the method in the classroom. The court's findings of fact and conclusions of law were supported by the record, and the court did not fail to make findings when required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a).

gold_text: The difficulty we face is that the district court failed to comply with Rule 52(a) requiring findings of fact and conclusions of law upon the granting or refusing of a preliminary injunction. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) (“in granting or refusing interlocutory injunction the court shall ... set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action”). The language of the Rule is mandatory. See, e.g., Mayo v. Lakeland Highlands Canning Co., 309 U.S. 310, 316-17, 60 S.Ct. 517, 520, 84 L.Ed. 774 (1940); H. Prang Trucking Co. v. Local Union No. 469, 613 F.2d 1235, 1238 (3d Cir.1980); I.C.C. v. Cardinale Trucking Corp., 308 F.2d 435, 437 (1962). We have held that the Rule 52 requirements must be met even when there has been no evidentiary hearing on the motion. See Educational Testing Serv. v. Katzman, 793 F.2d 533 (3d Cir.1986) (applying Rule 52 although parties had waived hearing); McWhinney v. Cain, 289 F.2d 315 (3d Cir.1961) (per curiam).
