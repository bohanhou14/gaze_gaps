In the context of legal cases, the provided references 387 U.S. 397 and 510 F.2d 692 are crucial in understanding the duty of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations regarding the payment of travel expenses. 

The case 387 U.S. 397, which involves the railroad industry, highlights the importance of coordination and regulation in ensuring the efficient and economical transportation of goods. Similarly, in the case 510 F.2d 692, the court emphasizes the Secretary's duty to promulgate regulations regarding the payment of travel expenses under the Social Security Act.

In the latter case, the court rules that the Secretary has a duty to promulgate regulations regarding the payment of travel expenses, citing Section 405(a) of the Social Security Act, which grants the Secretary the power to make rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act. The court also notes that the payment of travel expenses is an integral part of the "method of taking and furnishing" proof, and that the lack of regulations may cause claimants to be unaware of their right to an advance of such expenses.

The case 510 F.2d 692 also highlights the importance of considering the congressional intent and the duty of the courts to regard each statute as effective, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary. In this case, the court finds that the continuing resolutions, which limit travel expense reimbursement under Section 1383(h) to travel of more than seventy-five miles, do not repeal the Secretary's duty to promulgate regulations regarding payment of travel expenses.

In conclusion, the references 387 U.S. 397 and 510 F.2d 692 demonstrate the importance of coordination, regulation, and congressional intent in ensuring the efficient and economical administration of programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has a duty to promulgate regulations regarding the payment of travel expenses, and the lack of such regulations may cause unnecessary uncertainty and hardship for claimants.

gold_text: The Secretary points out that, as recently as April 19, 1984, she has announced her formal intention to publish proposed regulations. See 49 Fed.Reg. 15,850-15,851 (April 19, 1984). As the district court notes, however, a notice of proposal to issue travel expense regulations “is of little significance.” Pulido, 568 F.Supp. at 632. The notice does not bind the Secretary to publish regulations, nor does it prevent her from later denying that she has a mandate to publish regulations. See American Trucking Assoc, v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co., 387 U.S. 397, 415-16, 87 S.Ct. 1608, 1618-19, 18 L.Ed.2d 847 (1967). Indeed, the Secretary has announced such intentions several times before, but has yet to publish proposed regulations. Given this history of delay, we find it necessary to have a timetable established to ensure that the regulations mandated by the statute are, indeed, promulgated. Such timetables are “an appropriate procedure for exercise of the court’s equity powers to vindicate the public interest.” Natural Resources Defense Council v. Train, 510 F.2d 692, 705 (D.C.Cir.1975).
