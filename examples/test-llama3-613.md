gold_text: The Trustee requests prejudgment interest from the date of the Complaint in an amount to be determined by the Court. Although the Bankruptcy Code does not expressly provide for an award of pre-judgment interest in an action commenced under section 547, courts rely on the word “value” in section 560(a) as authorizing an award of interest. See McHale v. Boulder Capital LLC (In re 1031 Tax Group, LLC), 439 B.R. 84, 87 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2010). The award of prejudgment interest is discretionary, and “absent a sound reason to deny prejudgment interest, such interest should be awarded.” See id.; see also Buchwald Capital Advisors LLC v. Metl-Span I., Ltd. (In re Pameco Corp.), 356 B.R. 327, 342 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2006). The purpose of awarding pre-judgment interest in an action to recover a preferential transfer “is to restore the estate to the full value of the asset transferred in order to compensate it for the loss of time value of the asset.” In re Pameco Corp., 356 B.R. at 342. Based on the circumstances of this case, prejudgment interest is awarded at the Federal rate from the date of the Complaint (January 28, 2015).
