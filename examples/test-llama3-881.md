The presented reference cases, 477 U.S. 57 and 970 F.2d 178, provide valuable insights into the legal framework governing sexual harassment and employer liability. In the reference case 477 U.S. 57, the court held that a claim of "hostile environment" sex discrimination is actionable under Title VII, and that the employer's policy against sexual harassment must be more than just a general policy against discrimination. The court also emphasized that the mere existence of a grievance procedure and a policy against discrimination does not necessarily insulate the employer from liability.

In the reference case 970 F.2d 178, the court examined the employer's liability for sexual harassment by a supervisor. The court found that the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action, which led to the employee's resignation. The court held that the employer's failure to take prompt remedial action was not sufficient to remedy the situation and prevent further harm.

In the context of the present case, the reference cases 477 U.S. 57 and 970 F.2d 178 are relevant in determining the employer's liability for sexual harassment. The case at hand involves a claim of sexual harassment by a supervisor, which is actionable under Title VII. The employer's policy against sexual harassment must be more than just a general policy against discrimination, and the employer must take prompt remedial action to remedy the situation and prevent further harm.

In conclusion, the reference cases 477 U.S. 57 and 970 F.2d 178 provide important guidance on the legal framework governing sexual harassment and employer liability. The courts have emphasized the importance of prompt remedial action and the need for employers to take concrete steps to prevent and remedy sexual harassment in the workplace. The reference cases demonstrate that employers can be held liable for sexual harassment by supervisors, and that the mere existence of a grievance procedure and a policy against discrimination does not necessarily insulate the employer from liability.

Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 72, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2408, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986), if Tri-State had had an effective sexual harassment policy in place, the results of this case may have been different.

More importantly, if Tri-State had such a policy in place, perhaps Hogland would not have engaged in the offending conduct. As stated in the regulations:
