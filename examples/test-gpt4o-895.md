**Generation:**

Lastly, the defendant raises the issue of new arguments being mentioned in the plaintiff's reply brief, contending that the plaintiff's failure to raise certain claims initially should result in dismissal. This principle is supported by several precedents which indicate that courts typically do not entertain issues introduced for the first time in a reply brief. For instance, in McBride's case (800 F.2d 1208), the court affirmed the dismissal based on the plaintiff’s omission in the opening brief. Similarly, in 974 F.2d 192, it was noted that courts are not bound to render judgments on arguments over which they have jurisdiction, especially if those arguments were not initially presented. The risk of issuing ill-advised opinions when considering arguments raised late in the process is emphasized by cases like Haldeman (800 F.2d 1208).

In this matter, however, the plaintiff has not introduced new claims or arguments in her reply that were previously omitted. Instead, the focus has remained consistent on the claims of assault, battery, and IIED. Therefore, the defendant's argument does not merit the granting of summary judgment. Accordingly, the defendant's motion is denied concerning the plaintiff's claims of assault, battery, and IIED.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff’s negligence claims but denies the motion on the claims of assault, battery, and IIED. An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion is issued this date.

See Def.’s Reply at 5-7 (attacking the adequacy of the plaintiffs evidence); id. at 10 (arguing that the plaintiff consented to the offensive touching).

For the sake of thoroughness, however, the court will briefly explain why these arguments must also be rejected.
