To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) she participated in a Title VII protected activity, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action by her employer, and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. Aryain v. Watt-Mart Stores Tex. LP, 534 F.3d 473, 484 (5th Cir.2008).

In this case, Plaintiff contends that she was subjected to retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. However, the allegations are vague and do not provide sufficient facts to support a claim of retaliation. The complaint does not specify what actions were taken by Defendants that constituted adverse employment actions, nor does it provide any evidence of a causal connection between the alleged protected activity and the alleged adverse actions.

Furthermore, the Court has held that an employment action must be “materially adverse” to constitute retaliation. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2415, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). The Court must separate significant from trivial harms and filter out complaints attacking the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing. Id.

In light of the above, Plaintiff's claim of retaliation lacks sufficient factual allegations and does not provide a plausible basis for relief. The claim should be dismissed.

Based on the analysis above, the Court adopts the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge and recommends that the claims of Teresa Bullard be dismissed with prejudice. The parties have 14 days from the date of this Order to file objections thereto.

ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) is GRANTED and the claims of Teresa Bullard are DISMISSED with prejudice.

So ORDERED.

gold_text: The final claim asserted in the Complaint is retaliation. Plaintiff alleges that she filed a complaint with the OIG and then feared for her job. No other facts are provided concerning this claim. A plaintiff alleging retaliation must show that: (1) she participated in a Title VII protected activity, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action by her employer, and (3) that there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. Stewart v. Mississippi Transportation Commission, 586 F.3d 321, 331 (5th Cir.2009). While not limited to ultimate employment decisions, “[t]he antiretaliation provisions protect an individual not from all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm.” Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co., 548 U.S. 53, 67, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2414, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). To be an adverse employment action for purposes of establishing retaliation, the action must be “materially adverse.” Id. at 68, 126 S.Ct. at 2415. A plaintiff must show “that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.” Id. “[P]etty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience,” which may include personality conflicts and “snubbing,” are not actionable. Id.
