In consideration of Plaintiffs’ Request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, the Court notes that Plaintiffs seek to prevent IBM from taking any action that may exacerbate their health problems, which they attribute to exposure to toxic mold in Building 061. However, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a clear showing of irreparable harm or immediate injury that would warrant injunctive relief.

In Blackwelder v. Hilb, Robinson, Cook, Purvis, Brooks & Scott, Inc., 550 F.2d 189 (4th Cir. 1977), the court established that a plaintiff must show a clear showing of irreparable harm or immediate injury to be entitled to preliminary relief. Similarly, in Reference Case 952 F.2d 802, the court held that the plaintiff must demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits and a likelihood of irreparable harm.

Upon reviewing the pleadings, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. As discussed above, the allegations in Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint fall short of the level of egregiousness present in Woodson, and Plaintiffs have failed to show that IBM knew that its actions with respect to Plaintiffs were substantially certain to cause Plaintiffs to experience severe illnesses.

Furthermore, the Court finds that the harm Plaintiffs claim to have suffered is not irreparable. Plaintiffs have suffered personal injuries, but these injuries can be compensated through a damages award. The Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if injunctive relief is not granted.

In light of the above, the Court denies Plaintiffs’ Request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. Plaintiffs are free to continue their claims for damages, and the Court will proceed with the litigation on the merits.

gold_text: The final matter before the Court, therefore, is Plaintiffs’ Request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (hereinafter “Plaintiffs’ Request”), which Plaintiffs included as part of their Memorandum in Opposition to the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss and Request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. Plaintiffs request that the Court enjoin IBM from continued removal of allegedly mold-covered materials, which Plaintiffs contend they need to examine to pursue their claims against IBM. In its Reply Brief, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs’ Request violates the Local Rules of this district. Notwithstanding Defendant’s contentions that Plaintiffs have committed procedural errors in making their Request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, the Court will, with respect to Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, nevertheless consider Plaintiffs’ Request on the merits. The Court notes that a preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy ... to be applied only in [the] limited circumstances which clearly demand it.” Direx Israel, Ltd. v. Breakthrough Med. Corp., 952 F.2d 802, 811 (4th Cir.1991) (second alteration in original) (internal quotations omitted). In determining whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction, the Court must consider four factors: (1) the plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying dispute; (2) the likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiff if the injunction is denied; (3) the likelihood of harm to the defendant if the injunction is issued; and (4) the public interest. Blackwelder Furniture Co. of Statesville v. Seilig Mfg. Co., 550 F.2d 189, 192-93, 196 (4th Cir.1977). As discussed above, the Court has granted Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim. Therefore, based upon the Court’s ruling on Plaintiffs’ Woodson claims, it is clear that Plaintiffs cannot prevail on the merits of their claims. Further, to grant a preliminary injunction under these circumstances would cause greater harm to Defendant than to Plaintiffs given the Court’s ruling on the substantive issue before the Court. In addition, there would be no public interest served by granting a preliminary injunction under the circumstances of this case. Furthermore, as a practical matter, any injunctive relief now would likely be ineffectual due to the substantial likelihood that IBM had already removed the toxic-mold-covered materials from the facility by the time this matter was submitted to this Court for consideration. For the foregoing reasons, therefore, Plaintiffs’ Request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction is denied.
