**Generation:**

The claims made by Sheehan and Gaspard are paralleled by the case discussed in reference case 411 U.S. 677, where the differential treatment of individuals based on gender was deemed unconstitutional. Similarly, the discriminatory treatment of servicemen exposed to radiation, without proper post-discharge care and warnings, raises significant Due Process concerns under the Fifth Amendment. However, our primary focus remains the applicability of the Feres doctrine.

In reference to the due process discussion in case 346 U.S. 137, which evaluated the adequacy of administrative and judicial review processes, we must note that the military's review and failure to provide a further hearing were similarly scrutinized. This precedent supports the dismissal reasoning for Sheehan and Gaspard's claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671 et seq., and their Bivens claims. The courts found no jurisdiction over the FTCA and no valid relief theory under Bivens for military orders-related injuries. Therefore, the decisions by the district courts to dismiss these claims have precedent in high judicial rulings.

AFFIRMED.

gold_text: . The Wallace court did acknowledge that Bivens would still support a petition for injunctive relief by a serviceman. See, e.g., Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973). Of course, injunctive relief, a matter of discretion in the district court, could not be used to obstruct necessary military orders. Other non-monetary relief may also be available in the civilian courts, even in some cases where the military justice system retains jurisdiction. Eg., Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953) (court-martial subject to habeas corpus review). See Sherman, Legal Inadequacies and Doctrinal Restraints in Controlling the Military, 49 Ind.L.J. 539, 575-80 (1974). The instant case, however, concerns only a request for money damages.
