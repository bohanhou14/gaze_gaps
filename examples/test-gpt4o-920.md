F. In evaluating the debtor’s motion, it is essential to consider the stringent requirements laid out in the referenced cases. In 286 U.S. 106, the Supreme Court emphasized that any modification of an injunction necessitates a clear showing of grievous wrong caused by new and unforeseen conditions. The Court stated that "nothing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead us to change what was decreed after years of litigation with the consent of all concerned."

G. Similarly, as reinforced in 405 F.2d 803, the criteria for modifying a final decree include demonstrating oppressive hardship, substantial and unexpected changes, and providing an almost unanswerable case for modification. The court noted that “[modification is only cautiously to be granted; that some change is not enough” and there must be “[nothing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions].”

H. The debtor's circumstances, while challenging, do not meet the high standard set forth in these precedent cases. The debtor has failed to secure alternative financing and relied on speculative improvements in sales due to an unpredictable hunting season. This does not constitute the "clear and convincing showing" required under Rule 60(b)(5) or (6).

I. Consequently, the debtor’s failure to demonstrate that the conditions have materially and unforeseeably changed to the extent required by the aforementioned cases, particularly 286 U.S. 106 and 405 F.2d 803, necessitates the denial of the motion for relief from the orders of July 28, 1980, and August 11, 1980.

J. Based on the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, the debtor’s Motion for Modification of Agreement of July 28, 1980, and for continuation of the Automatic Stay is hereby denied.

SO ORDERED.
