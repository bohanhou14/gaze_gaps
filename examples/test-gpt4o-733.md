**G. Geauga Savings' Counterclaims**

Given the broad nature of Ms. Ford's allegations and their indistinguishability between defendants, Geauga Savings' counterclaims require judicial scrutiny for jurisdiction. In accordance with the discretion granted under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c) and as exemplified in the reference cases, district courts have the authority to decline supplemental jurisdiction in certain scenarios (522 U.S. 156). Particularly, when state-law claims substantially predominate or when all claims over which federal jurisdiction was originally invoked have been dismissed, it is prudent for the courts to consider aspects such as judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity before proceeding with state claims (484 U.S. 343).

Given that all federal claims against Geauga Savings have been dismissed and considering the factors highlighted in the reference cases, declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state claims is justified. The dismissal aligns with the principle that remanding a case typically serves justice better where state interests and efficient resolution are concerned, especially if it involves avoiding undue prejudice from statute limitations expiring (484 U.S. 343).

Therefore, the Court dismisses Geauga Savings' counterclaims for being predominantly state-law centered, invoking the cited precedents to uphold the priorities of fairness and judicial efficiency.

gold_text: With dismissal of the plaintiffs claims, there remain Geauga Savings’ state law counterclaims, which are before the Court pursuant to its supplemental jurisdiction. When a district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, it may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims brought under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). “[W]hen deciding whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, ‘a federal court should consider and weigh in each case, and at every stage of the litigation, the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity.’ ” City of Chicago v. International College of Surgeons, 522 U.S. 156, 173, 118 S.Ct. 523, 139 L.Ed.2d 525 (1997) (quoting Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988)). The Court has considered and weighed the relevant factors, and it declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Geauga Savings’ counterclaims. These claims will therefore be remanded to state court.
