The court's decision to reverse the district court's grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the Keller Companies is well-supported by the precedent set forth in reference cases. The non-assignment clause in the Wausau policy, which prohibits assignment of the policy without the insurer's written consent, is enforceable in Texas courts, as seen in cases such as Texas Farmers Insurance Co. v. Gerdes (955 F.2d 1353) and Texas Pacific Indemnity Co. v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (535 F.2d 287). These cases demonstrate that even post-loss assignments are subject to the non-assignment clause, and that the assignee lacks standing to bring a claim against the insurance company.

Moreover, the court's rejection of the Northern Insurance rule, which holds that insurance coverage for pre-acquisition losses transfers by operation of law when the liabilities in question are transferred by operation of law, is also supported by precedent. In Fiorito v. Superior Court (226 Cal.App.3d 433, 277 Cal.Rptr. 27), the California Court of Appeal held that a recent California case leaves open the possibility that insurers may be liable for pre-tender costs, which suggests that the Northern Insurance rule may not be applicable in all cases. Additionally, other courts have rejected the Northern Insurance rule where the acquiring company assumes liability through contract, as seen in Pilkington North America, Inc. v. Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. (403 F.3d 246, 250).

In light of these precedents, the court's decision to reverse the district court's grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the Keller Companies is well-supported. The non-assignment clause in the Wausau policy is enforceable, and the Northern Insurance rule is not applicable in this case. Therefore, Wausau's refusal to provide coverage to the Keller Companies is justified, and the Keller Companies' claims for defense and indemnity are denied.
