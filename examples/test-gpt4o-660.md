Given the nature of this case, we must address the issues by referencing pertinent precedents. The petitioner’s first contention, that the estate is entitled to deduct the face amount of the installments outstanding at the date of death, must be scrutinized in light of the Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 151 decision. The Supreme Court in Ithaca Trust ruled that for Federal estate tax purposes, the value of the deduction must be determined as of the date of death, utilizing actuarial tables (6 T.C. 582).

Moreover, the contention made by the petitioner that the estate should deduct the accrued payments during administration plus the cost of the annuity policy, conflicts with established principles. As indicated in Estate of John Sage (39 T.C. 371), subsequent events after death, such as purchasing an annuity to satisfy an obligation, do not alter the initial valuation which must be computed based on the date of death.

Lastly, the petitioner's reliance on Table II under section 20.2031-7 (f) to derive a different figure does not hold, as the Commissioner’s method, utilizing the commuted present value calculation (in accordance with IRS Actuarial Tables), aligns with precedent and regulations. Therefore, the Commissioner’s determination is sustained, and the allowable deduction is appropriately adjusted to $92,456.16.

In conclusion, the petitioner’s claims lack merit in light of relevant legal precedents and established regulatory guidance.
