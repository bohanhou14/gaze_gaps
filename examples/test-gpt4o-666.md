The importance of the SPD's language in governing the interpretation of subrogation rights is reinforced by the legal precedent set forth in reference cases. For instance, 906 F.2d 903 establishes that ERISA mandates strict adherence to summary plan descriptions over conflicting plan documents. Similarly, in 851 F.2d 134, the court underscored that employees are entitled to rely on the SPD, particularly when it conflicts with undisclosed plan terms. Moreover, 758 F.2d 1566 emphasizes that SPDs must be sufficiently accurate and understandable to inform participants of their rights and obligations. Given these precedents, the SPD's language limiting subrogation to avoid double payment must prevail, and the trustees' interpretation demanding full recovery from third-party compensation is inconsistent and unreasonable. Therefore, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted, highlighting that the SPD's disclosed terms govern the extent of subrogation, not the separate subrogation agreement.

gold_text: ERISA’s disclosure and reporting requirements mandate that the administrator of an employee benefit plan supply each participant covered under the plan with a summary plan description, along with all modifications and changes, which must also be filed with the Secretary of Labor. 29 U.S.C. §§ 1021(a), 1021(b). According to the statute, the summary plan description is required to contain certain information listed in § 1022(b), “shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant, and shall be sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.” 29 U.S.C. § 1022(a)(1). Courts have frequently held that, when there is a discrepancy between a “plan summary” as defined in § 1022, and other documents which purport to define the rights and obligations of plan participant but which were neither filed with the Secretary nor disclosed to participants in accordance with § 1021, the summary plan description controls. See Heidgerd v. Olin Corp., 906 F.2d 903, 906-9 (2nd Cir.1990); Edwards v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., 851 F.2d 134, 135-37 (6th Cir.1988); McKnight v. Southern Life and Health Ins. Co., 758 F.2d 1566, 1570 (11th Cir.1985).
