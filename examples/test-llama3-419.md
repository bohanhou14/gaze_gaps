The cases provided, Reference case 490 U.S. 319 and Reference case 828 F.2d 1471, have shed light on the importance of considering the procedural and substantive requirements in evaluating claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. 

In Reference case 490 U.S. 319, the Supreme Court emphasized the need for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, citing Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976). This standard has been applied in various circuit courts, including the Tenth Circuit, to evaluate Eighth Amendment claims of cruel and unusual punishment in the context of medical attention.

In Reference case 828 F.2d 1471, the court discussed the procedural requirements for evaluating claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, including the need for personal participation and exhaustion of administrative remedies. The court also highlighted the importance of considering the substantive requirements of the statute, including the need for a specific identification of constitutional rights allegedly invaded.

In the context of the current case, it is essential to consider these procedural and substantive requirements. Mr. Green's claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 must be evaluated in light of the standard established in Estelle v. Gamble and the procedural requirements outlined in Reference case 828 F.2d 1471.

Specifically, Mr. Green's claims against Defendants McCoy and Sutmiller must be dismissed due to lack of personal participation, as noted in Reference case 828 F.2d 1471. Similarly, his claims against Defendants Hininger, Miller, and Reiheld must be dismissed due to lack of personal participation and failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

In conclusion, the cases provided demonstrate the importance of considering procedural and substantive requirements in evaluating claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Mr. Green's claims must be evaluated in light of these requirements to determine whether they are frivolous and/or fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

gold_text: The district court therefore dismissed the action. The court also noted that it had earlier authorized Mr. Green to commence the action “in forma pauperis under the authority of 28 U.S.C. § 1915. Subsection (e) of that statute permits the dismissal of a case when the court is satisfied that the complaint is without merit in that it lacks an arguable basis either in law or fact.” Op. & Order at 5; R. Vol. 1 at 582 (citing Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); Yellen v. Cooper, 828 F.2d 1471, 1475 (10th Cir.1987)). As indicated above, the court also counted the dismissal as a strike under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).
