At this juncture, the failure to conduct a competency hearing conflicts with due process principles as recognized in case law. In **Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375 (1966)**, the Supreme Court underscored the constitutional importance of a competency hearing when there's sufficient evidence to cause doubt about a defendant's mental state. Similarly, in **United States v. Knohl, 379 F.2d 427 (2d Cir. 1967)**, the court held that mental competency to stand trial necessitates a hearing when indicators of incompetence are present.

Moreover, **429 F.2d 630** highlighted that the necessity for a competency hearing remains crucial if there's contemporary evidence casting doubt on the defendant's mental state. When Judge Costantino received further evidence of appellant's mental health issues, it paralleled the context in **420 U.S. 162**, where failure to reassess competency based on new facts led to due process concerns.

The eventual proceedings should have navigated using the guideline provided in **United States v. Malcolm, 432 F.2d 809 (2d Cir. 1970)**, accentuating the court’s duty to ensure the absence of mental disturbances that could impair comprehension or capacity for a rational plea.

Thus, the record mandates a retroactive competency evaluation per **18 U.S.C. § 4244** to conclude the appropriateness of Saddler's plea and sentencing, aligning with the precedent in **523 F.2d 539**, where the defendant's sentencing comprehension was scrutinized due to earlier mental instability indications. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a comprehensive assessment in line with due process standards.

gold_text: Against this background it was error to proceed with sentencing, since it was apparent that appellant lacked the capacity to exercise his right of allocation, Rule 32(a), F.R.Cr.P.; United States v. Malcolm, 432 F.2d 809 (2d Cir. 1970). The proper course was to defer sentencing, pending the conduct of a court-ordered § 4244 examination and hearing to ascertain his capacity to proceed. United States v. Knohl, 379 F.2d 427, 435 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 973, 88 S.Ct. 472, 19 L.Ed.2d 465 (1967). Furthermore, having been alerted by this flurry of warning flags to the possibility that appellant might also have been mentally incompetent to plead two months earlier, the court should have directed that the § 4244 examination be expanded to determine the defendant’s competency to plead. Had that course been pursued, we would not now be faced with the necessity of ordering a retrospective examination some three years later, a procedure that is frowned upon, see Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 183, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975); Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 386, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966); Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960), but which has been followed in cases where, as here, no reasonable alternative remained. See United States ex rel. Suggs v. LaVallee, 523 F.2d 539 (2d Cir. 1975); Miranda v. United States, 458 F.2d 1179 (2d Cir. 1972); Conner v. Wingo, 429 F.2d 630 (6th Cir. 1970).
