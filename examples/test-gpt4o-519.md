4. Cooperation Agreement and Compensation of Informants

Petitioner claims that his rights were violated due to the government's use of compensated informants and that the cooperation agreement was ambiguous and should have precluded the admission of evidence gathered through informants. This argument is unpersuasive and does not align with established legal principles.

Regarding the cooperation agreement, the petitioner suggests that it was ambiguous, similar to the claim made by Randolph in the case referenced 230 F.3d 243. However, as observed in Randolph's case, the language of the agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas was deemed customary and not reasonably confusing for a defendant represented by counsel. Therefore, the agreement should not be construed against the government merely based on typical terminologies or sequencing of provisions.

Furthermore, concerning the compensation of informants, the reference case 195 F.3d 389 illustrates that mere payment to informants does not inherently compromise the integrity of the testimony. In Albanese’s case, the court determined that the government's compensation did not imply improper influence on the witness's testimony. Similarly, in this case, the compensation given to informant Almond does not alone substantiate claims of coercion or unreliability of the testimony provided.

In conclusion, the petitioner's arguments regarding the cooperation agreement's ambiguity and the compensation of informants fail to demonstrate constitutional violations. Therefore, these claims do not merit relief.

III. Conclusion

For the reasons stated above, petitioner’s additional claims are without merit. Accordingly, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is denied. However, a certificate of appealability is granted on the second issue only, allowing for an appeal limited to the question of the admissibility of petitioner’s statement to the police obtained without a Miranda warning.

SO ORDERED.

gold_text: The District Attorney’s assistance to Almond did not violate petitioner’s rights under the Constitution. The evidence that the informant was paid involves testimony that his cooperation was noted to authorities, who considered his applications favorably for conjugal visits, work release, and favorable parole treatment; and that he was given cash assistance in moving his residence. The federal antibribery statute that petitioner alleges was violated by this conduct is. inapplicable to state officials and inapplicable to sentencing deals with witnesses for their cooperation in a prosecution. See United States v. Randolph, 230 F.3d 243 (6th Cir.2000) (indicating that the statute does not apply to deals for leniency); United States v. Albanese, 195 F.3d 389 (8th Cir.1999) (indicating that the statute does not prohibit payment from prosecutor to witness when issue is presented to and explored before jury). Furthermore, the facts presented do not show bribery.
