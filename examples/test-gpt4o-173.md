**Generation:**

David's argument for severance is reminiscent of the issues discussed in United States v. Blaylock, 421 F.3d 758, where the court denied severance due to the absence of a "firm representation" that a co-defendant would testify on the defendant’s behalf. Blaylock established that a mere inclination to testify or a hypothetical assistance is insufficient for granting severance. Similarly, in David's case, no firm representation from Scot or Powers indicating their willingness to testify was presented to the trial court.

Further bolstering this point, in United States v. Myers, 528 F.3d 1053, the appellate court emphasized that a defendant cannot simply claim the need for severance without demonstrating likely testimony from a co-defendant. Although David later provided post-trial affidavits from Scot and Powers, the district court during trial lacked this crucial information, rendering the trial court’s decision not to sever reasonable at that time.

Moreover, the compartmentalization of evidence by the jury in joint trials, as seen in Blaylock, 421 F.3d 758, underscores the efficacy of joint trials without inherent prejudice when managed properly. David failed to show any significant inability of the jury to compartmentalize the evidence relating to each defendant.

In summary, David's joinder with his co-defendants did not constitute an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law pursuant to Zafiro, and his reliance on Eighth Circuit precedents does not alter this conclusion under AEDPA constraints.

gold_text: In any event, we have held that a “district court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to sever absent a ‘firm representation’ that a co-defendant would be willing to testify on the defendant’s behalf.” United States v. Crumley, 528 F.3d 1053, 1063 (8th Cir.2008) (quoting United States v. Blaylock, 421 F.3d 758, 767 (8th Cir.2005)). David emphasizes that his attorney informed the state trial court at a pre-trial hearing that Scot and Powers “intimated that they would be prepared to testify for [David] based upon the facts leading up to this incident,” but this statement does not constitute a “firm representation” that they were actually willing to testify for David. See id. (“In his pretrial motion, [the defendant] neglected to offer a ‘firm representation’ that [his codefendant] was willing to testify, but simply stated that he would call [his codefendant] to testify and that her testimony would exculpate him. He offered no proof to the district court that [his codefendant] agreed to testify on [his] behalf.”) (footnote omitted). Similarly, the post-trial affidavits of Scot and Powers do not support David’s position because whether a state “court’s determination ‘resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States’ ” must be decided “in light of the record before it.” Nance v. Norris, 392 F.3d 284, 293 (8th Cir.2004) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1)). Even under our precedent, David’s claim would fail.
