In the case at hand, the district court granted Brown University's motion for summary judgment, dismissing Kirsch's counterclaim for libel. The Notice to Bookmen, published by Brown University, stated that Kirsch had solicited or accepted materials in the name of Brown University without authorization, and that he had not turned over the materials to the University. Kirsch argued that the district court usurped the role of the jury in determining the defamatory meaning of the Notice and that the court erred in finding no genuine issue of material fact concerning the truthfulness of the Notice.

In Sartor v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corp. (326 U.S. 1), the Supreme Court held that a court should not grant summary judgment unless there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Similarly, in Carter v. Williams (361 F.2d 189, 193), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals stated that the burden is on the movant for summary judgment to establish the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.

In the present case, the district court's determination of the defamatory meaning of the Notice to Bookmen was reasonable and within the bounds of reason. The court's interpretation of the Notice was least favorable to Brown University, the moving party, but still within the bounds of reason. The court's finding of no genuine issue of material fact concerning the truthfulness of the Notice was also supported by the evidence. Therefore, the district court's grant of summary judgment was proper.

Additionally, the court's finding that Kirsch had not turned over the materials to Brown University was supported by the evidence. Kirsch had received materials from Taiman, Davis, and Morrish, but he had not returned the materials to Brown University. This supported the Notice's statement that Kirsch had not turned over the materials to the University.

In conclusion, the district court's grant of summary judgment was proper. The court's determination of the defamatory meaning of the Notice to Bookmen was reasonable and within the bounds of reason, and the court's finding of no genuine issue of material fact concerning the truthfulness of the Notice was supported by the evidence.
