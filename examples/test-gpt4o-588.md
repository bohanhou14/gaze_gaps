We note the evidentiary challenges presented in determining the fair market value of tangible assets, particularly when divergent appraisals exist. In instances where the value of tangible assets and the business as a whole can be ascertained with reasonable certainty, the "residual" method is typically employed to determine the intangible value, such as going-concern value, by subtracting the value of tangible assets from the total purchase price. This method has been validated in cases such as Jack Daniel Distillery v. United States, 180 Ct. Cl. 308, 379 F.2d 569, and Forward Communications Corp. v. United States, 221 Ct. Cl. 582, 608 F.2d 485. However, given the discrepancies between appraisals in the present case, reliance on the "residual" method is problematic.

Alternatively, the capitalization method provides a structured approach to isolate and value the going-concern element. As recognized in VGS Corp. v. Commissioner, 68 T.C. 563, this method capitalizes earnings attributable to intangibles to ascertain their total value. Given K-D’s reliance on a single client and competitive market environment, we have balanced risk factors to determine an appropriate capitalization rate of 20 percent. 

Consequently, earnings attributable to going-concern value ($66,997) capitalized at a 20 percent discount rate yield a total going-concern value of $334,985. This value is then allocated proportionately among the depreciable assets, as detailed previously, in alignment with our method and consistent with guidance from case law including R. M. Smith, Inc. v. Commissioner, 69 T.C. 317, 320-323 and the directive from the Sixth Circuit in Concord Control, Inc. v. Commissioner, 615 F.2d 1153, explaining our approach and justifications for these allocations.

gold_text: While this Court and others have undertaken to determine the value of goodwill (see, e.g., Forward Communications Corp. v. United States, 221 Ct. Cl. 582, 608 F.2d 485 (1979); Jack Daniel Distillery v. United States, 180 Ct. Cl. 308, 379 F.2d 569 (1967)), no case has clearly addressed the issue of how to determine the amount of going-concern value. See VGS Corp. v. Commissioner, 68 T.C. 563, 593-594 (1977); Black Industries, Inc. v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1979-61. Accordingly, this appears to be a case of first impression with respect to a method for determining the amount of going-concern value. See generally the emerging literature on this issue, including Weiner, "Going Concern Value: Goodwill by Any Other Name?” 33 Tax Lawyer 183 (1980); Danzig & Robinson, "Going Concern Value Reexamined,” 11 Tax Adviser 32 (1980); Grigsby & Cotter, "Amortization of Certain Intangibles,” 30 U.S. Cal. Tax Inst. 543, 558-570 (1978).
