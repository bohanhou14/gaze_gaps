In Reves v. Ernst & Young, the Supreme Court articulated the "operation or management" test for determining RICO liability, emphasizing that merely providing professional services is insufficient to establish participation in the operation or management of an enterprise (Reves, 507 U.S. at 179, 113 S.Ct. at 1170; reference case 21 F.3d 512). Echoing this sentiment, in the case of Emery v. American Gen. Fin., Inc. (“Emery II”), the court highlighted that performing services, even with awareness of an enterprise’s illicit activities, does not equate to RICO liability unless actual participation in the enterprise's management is demonstrated (Emery II, 134 F.3d 1321, reference case 156 F.3d 721). Additionally, merely indispensable services, as noted in Peat Marwick's involvement with Mutual Fire, do not suffice to create RICO liability without some controlling impact on the enterprise (reference case 996 F.2d 1534).

In summary, the Plaintiff has not provided evidence that the Defendants had any part in the operation or management of D'Onofrio's alleged enterprise under RICO standards. Therefore, the court deems the Defendants' motion for summary judgment to be supported by precedent, resulting in a failure to meet the requirements for RICO liability under the "operation or management" test.
