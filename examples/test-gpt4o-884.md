Defendant Ryder-Scott emphasizes that mere conclusory allegations are insufficient under Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), urging the court to adhere to the strict requirements illustrated in past cases. In 476 F.2d 393, the court ruled that while broad allegations of fraud are inadequate, specifying the "time, place and nature of the alleged fraudulent activities" suffices. Similarly, in 565 F.2d 602, it was highlighted that allegations must include enough detail for the defendant to prepare an adequate defense. In this case, plaintiffs specified the projected cash flows and reserve estimations but failed to detail when and in what form these representations were communicated, thus lacking the particularity required.

Additionally, the complaint does not adequately identify the financial statements as required per 68 F.R.D. 243, where the court required detailed identification of the documents containing alleged false information. Plaintiffsâ€™ general references to semiannual reports and reliance on external memoranda rather than intrinsic complaint details further diminish the complaint's sufficiency.

The court finds that the plaintiffs' complaint, although sufficient to outline the broad strokes of alleged misconduct, remains deficient in the particularized details mandated by Rule 9(b). Therefore, the motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) and (6) is denied, but the motion to require plaintiffs to replead with heightened specificity is granted. Plaintiffs must amend their complaint to include precise times, documents, and the nature of false statements, offering a clear account meeting Rule 9(b) requirements.

Crowell, Collier and Macmillan, 565 F.2d 602, 611 (9th Cir.1977). How much additional specificity is required depends on the nature of the individual case. See In re Com. Oil/Tesoro Petroleum Corp. Sec. Lit., supra at 250. In the instant action, Ryder-Scott is a firm of professional engineers whose business success depends to a large extent on its reputation for integrity. Such a situation justifies a greater degree of particularity. See Rich v. Touche Ross & Co., 68 F.R.D. 243, 245 (S.D.N.Y.1975); McFarland v. Memorex Corp., 493 F.Supp. 631, 638 (N.D.Cal.1980). McFarland holds that the plaintiffs should have to specify the misrepresentations, explain in what way they were false, and point out the facts that support an inference of fraud. Id. at 639. The document containing an allegedly fraudulent representation should be identified. Hokama v. E.F. Hutton & Co., Inc., supra at 646. Also, the complaint must be specific as to which state statutes purportedly have been violated by a defendant. Wenzoski v. Citicorp, 480 F.Supp. 1056, 1062 (N.D.Cal.1979).
