The present dispute bears resemblance to the issues discussed in Reference Case 85 F.3d 684, where the Commission's failure to clearly articulate its rationale led to a remand for further explanation. Similarly, the Commission here has not responded adequately to the substantial concerns raised by the petitioners regarding the maintenance cycle and other factors impacting forced outage rates. The court in 85 F.3d 684 emphasized the need for detailed grounds to justify the Commission's decision, which seems equally pertinent in this case. 

Moreover, Reference Case 332 U.S. 194 underscores the imperative for judicial oversight in ensuring that administrative actions adhere to the principle of reasoned decision-making. The dissent in 332 U.S. 194 highlighted the necessity for transparent rationale in administrative determinations, akin to the current scenario where the Commission's succinct rationale fails to meet the requisite standard of explanation.

Given the lack of comprehensive reasoning and the Commission's oversight in addressing key objections adequately, the court thus opines that the Commission must further elucidate its justification for selecting the 12-month data period over a longer duration to ensure the translation of the price cap adheres to principles of revenue neutrality and predictive accuracy. Consequently, we remand this case to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

gold_text: In its brief on review the Commission also maintains that it is sensible to use only twelve months data to predict the future outage rate for price cap purposes because only twelve months of data are used to calculate how much “UCAP” each supplier has available for sale. Thus the amount suppliers are allowed to sell will be reduced by the exact amount that the price cap is increased. Other than the cryptic statement that a 12-month period “ensures that the UCAP conversion terms are consistent throughout the New York State,” Order on Rehearing, 98 FERC ¶ 61,180 at 61,666, the Commission did not adopt this rationale, however, and “post hoc salvage operations of counsel” cannot overcome the inadequacy of the Commission’s explanation. Florida Power & Light Co. v. FERC, 85 F.3d 684, 689 (D.C.Cir.1996), see generally SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196-97, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947). In any event, the perfection of such a translation is hardly obvious: the price cap remains at a fixed level until the Commission changes it, while the amount of UCAP that sellers are allowed to sell keeps changing and can go up or down based on a 12-month rolling average. If the petitioners are correct that the Commission set the price cap when the forced outage rates were below-average in their cycle, petitioners will not always have as much UCAP available as they did the month of . the translation, and will lose revenue in the long run. The question is whether the Commission used data that accurately predict forced outage rates in the future, rather than simply data that reflect those rates during the month of translation. If not, the Commission has changed the price cap without the requisite inquiry into whether the new rate is just and reasonable, see 16 U.S.C. §§ 824d(a), (b); 18 C.F.R. § 35.13.
