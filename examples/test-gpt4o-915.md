In the current matter, it is paramount to consider the precedent established in similar cases to ascertain the appropriate determination of willful and malicious injury under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6). The reference case 56 F.3d 52 articulates that a debtor's action of willful conversion constitutes a willful and malicious injury if it involves unauthorized exercise of ownership over collateral to the exclusion of the owner's rights. The bankruptcy court found in 56 F.3d 52 that Wolfson’s deliberate retention and conversion of collateral proceeds, which should have been remitted to ECC, was executed with a willful and malicious intent to harm the creditor.

Applying this to the present case, Mr. Shelton’s removal and disposal of the truck's enhanced parts, pledged as collateral, parallels the acts observed in the reference case. The bankruptcy court determined that Shelton's acts, including trading the seats and discarding the wheels and cab extender, were done willfully without notifying the creditor, which deprived Steering Federal Credit Union of secured assets.

The evidentiary findings place Mr. Shelton’s actions within the ambit of willful and malicious injury as outlined in 56 F.3d 52. Therefore, the court concludes that the nondischargeability of the $750 secured claim stands justified due to Mr. Shelton's willful and malicious conversion of property, aligning with the aforementioned precedent.

Accordingly, the court reverses the Bankruptcy Court's decision on non-dischargeability, rendering Steering's cross-appeal for attorney fees and prejudgment interest moot.

gold_text: Under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6) a discharge in bankruptcy may not be had for a willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity. “Willful and malicious injury includes willful and malicious conversion, which is the unauthorized exercise of ownership over goods belonging to another to the exclusion of the owner’s rights.” In re Wolfson, 56 F.3d 52, 54, Bankr.L.Rep. P 76,545 (11th Cir.1995). It is clear here that the bankruptcy court applied a lesser standard than the “maliciousness” required by the statute. When the Congress adopted section 523(a)(6) in its present form, it expressly overruled prior case law which had used a “reckless indifference” standard. See H.R.Rep., No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5963, 6320-21; In re Held, 734 F.2d 628, 630 (11th Cir.1984) (A conversion done without a conscious intent to violate the rights of another or under a mistake or misapprehension is dischargeable even though done recklessly.)
