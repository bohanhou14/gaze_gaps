In dismissing Fairweather's claims, it is necessary to address the Bivens claims against each of the named defendants, specifically federal entities and officials. The Supreme Court in FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, made it clear that Bivens actions cannot be extended to federal agencies due to the presence of qualified immunity which would be circumvented, eroding the Bivens remedy's intended deterrent effect on individual officers. Consequently, claims against the Federal Bureau of Prisons and Giles Dalby Correctional Facility must be dismissed.

Regarding claims against Janet Reno and John Doe, Warden Giles Dalby Facility, the doctrine of qualified immunity shields government officials from liability unless it is proven that their actions violated a clearly established statutory or constitutional right known to a reasonable person. In accordance with precedent (Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 21), a Bivens claim seeks to deter unconstitutional actions, but must focus primarily on individual conduct, not on federal policies or administrative decisions.

To the Warden and Captain Gearhart, on examining the factual basis for excessive force allegations, this court finds the actions taken were to maintain order, as supported by the detailed account and CBS's 28 F.3d 1223. Moreover, Fairweather's own refusal of medical treatment undermines his deliberate indifference claim.

In line with previous cases, such as Dobyns v. E-Systems, Inc., 667 F.2d 1219, it is essential to demonstrate a direct violation of constitutional rights by individual defendants to advance a Bivens claim (229 F.3d 374). Given Fairweather's failure to establish these essential elements, his complaint lacks merit.

Therefore, both the excessive force and deliberate medical indifference claims are dismissed with prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(b)(1). All remaining motions are denied as moot.

SO ORDERED.

gold_text: . Whether a private corporation acting under color of federal law may be subject to a Bivens claim is unclear. There is currently a split among the circuits on this issue. In FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994), the Supreme Court of the United States declined to extend Bivens actions to agencies of the federal government. In the wake of the Meyer decision, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that Meyer precluded Bivens suits against private entities acting under color of federal law. This overruled an earlier pre-Meyer D.C. Circuit Court decision allowing such claims. See Kauffman v. Anglo-American School of Sofia, 28 F.3d 1223 (D.C.Cir.1994), overruling Reuber v. United States, 750 F.2d 1039 (D.C.Cir.1984) (held that Bivens encompasses actions against private parties acting under color of federal law, and remanded for a determination of whether the defendant, an operator of a government-owned facility pursuant to a contract with the National Cancer Institute, had so acted). In contrast, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and, most recently, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals have held that Bivens liability extends to private corporations. See Hammons v. Norfolk S. Corp., 156 F.3d 701 (6th Cir.1998); Malesko v. Corr. Serv. Corp., 229 F.3d 374 (2d Cir.2000), cert. granted, Corr. Serv. Corp. v. Malesko,-U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 1224, 149 L.Ed.2d 134 (2001).
