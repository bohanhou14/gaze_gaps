The Government also draws attention to the principle discussed in the case of McGrath v. Commissioner, 764 F.2d 322, which held that the spread between the exercise price and the fair market value of the stock does not necessarily represent "economic income" due to potential restrictive conditions. This aligns with Kolom’s argument that the stock options’ bargain element, due to Section 16(b) restrictions, should defer tax treatment until it accurately reflects economic reality.

Additionally, Kolom’s reliance on the precedent established in Harrison v. United States analyzed whether the restrictive conditions on stock options affect their fair market value and subsequent tax treatment (752 F.2d 518). The court in Harrison emphasized that recognizing economic income should account for such restrictions, thus supporting Kolom’s position that the minimum tax should be assessed based on a fair market value adjusted for § 16(b) constraints.

Ultimately, the doctrine of equitable recoupment, as articulated in Bull v. United States and supported by subsequent rulings, affirms Kolom’s entitlement to a refund, thereby modifying and affirming the district court’s judgment.

gold_text: . Kolom I held that despite the restriction imposed on the sale of Kolom’s stock by § 16(b) of the Act, Kolom owed a minimum tax on the options’ bargain element in the year of exercise, 1972. Although the Supreme Court denied cer-tiorari, Justice Powell's dissent highlighted the inequities of the Kolom I holding. As a result, Congress passed an amendment excepting the options’ bargain element from minimum tax until after the lapse of the six month sale restriction of § 16(b) of the Act. IRC § 83(c)(3). This is the exact treatment Kolom accorded the exercise of his 1972 stock options. However, the amendment only applied to transfers made after December 31, 1981. Courts, addressing issues similar to those presented in Kolom I, now rule in favor of the taxpayer. See generally McDonald v. CIR, 764 F.2d 322 (5th Cir.1985) (holding Treas.Reg. § 1.57-l(f) inapplicable to lapse restriction imposed on qualified stock options); Estate of Gresham v. CIR, 752 F.2d 518 (10th Cir.1985).
