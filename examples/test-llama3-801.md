In the context of legal cases, there is a presumption of access to judicial documents. This means that documents submitted to the court, such as pleadings and motions, are considered public records unless there is a countervailing factor or a higher value that justifies non-disclosure. In the case of In re New York Times Co. (828 F.2d 116), the court held that there is a qualified First Amendment right of access to documents submitted to the court in connection with a summary judgment motion.

In the case at hand, plaintiffs have submitted documents that were previously designated as confidential, including the Graham Report. The City has argued that these documents are subject to attorney-client privilege and that their release would cause harm to law enforcement techniques. However, the court has rejected these claims and has found that the City has failed to show a "clearly defined and serious injury" that would result from the release of the redacted portions of the Graham Report (435 F.3d 110).

Furthermore, the court has noted that the presumption of access to judicial documents is particularly strong in the context of summary judgment motions, where the parties are seeking to have the court resolve factual disputes in their favor (692 F.2d 880). In this case, the court has found that the city has not shown that the documents at issue are not relevant to the litigation, and therefore, they should be disclosed to the public.

In conclusion, the court has rejected the City's claims of privilege and has ordered the release of the redacted portions of the Graham Report. The court has also noted that the presumption of access to judicial documents is strong in the context of summary judgment motions, and that the City has failed to show that the documents at issue are not relevant to the litigation. Therefore, the court has ordered that the documents be disclosed to the public.

gold_text: As was recently re-articulated in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.2006), “documents submitted to a court for its consideration in a summary judgment motion are—as a matter of law-—judicial documents to which a strong presumption of access attaches, under both the common law and the First Amendment.” Id. at 121. Lugosch notes that “summary judgment is an adjudication, and ‘[a]n adjudication is a formal act of government, the basis of which should, absent exceptional circumstances, be subject to public scrutiny.’ ” Id. (quoting Joy v. North, 692 F.2d 880, 893 (2d Cir.1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1051, 103 S.Ct. 1498, 75 L.Ed.2d 930 (1983) (brackets in original)). Thus, summary judgment documents “should not remain under seal absent the most compelling reasons.” Id.
