Here is the case write-up: 

The doctrine of act of state is rooted in the inherent nature of sovereign authority, which implies that a court will not question the validity of an act of a foreign state, even if it violates international law. In Reference case 376 U.S. 398, the Supreme Court held that the doctrine of act of state does not apply to acts of state that violate international law, but it does apply to the extent that the act of state is valid under the laws of the foreign state.

A foreign judgment is prima facie evidence of the truth of the matter adjudged, and it should be held conclusive unless some special ground is shown for impeaching the judgment, such as fraud or prejudice. In Reference case 544 F.2d 624, the court held that a foreign judgment should be recognized and enforced unless it was obtained by fraud or is contrary to the public policy of the forum state.

In this case, the district court held that the Australian judgment was valid and should be recognized and enforced. The court found that the plaintiff was aware of the Indian Foreign Exchange Regulations and that the contract was intended to comply with those regulations. The court also found that the plaintiff did not obtain the judgment by fraud and that the judgment was not contrary to the public policy of the forum state.

The defendant argues that the judgment should not be enforced because the Bretton Woods Agreement requires that the Indian regulation be enforced in this country. However, as held in Reference case 458 F.2d 255, a foreign judgment should be recognized and enforced unless it was obtained by fraud or is contrary to the public policy of the forum state. In this case, the judgment was valid and should be recognized and enforced.

In conclusion, the district court correctly held that the Australian judgment was valid and should be recognized and enforced. The doctrine of act of state and the principles of comity support the enforcement of the judgment. The judgment was not obtained by fraud, and it is not contrary to the public policy of the forum state. Therefore, the judgment should be recognized and enforced.
