In addressing appellant's further contention that the state failed to exhaust its remedies before the federal proceedings, we find no basis for reversal. Appellant posits that the state conceded futility in its answer to his habeas petition, and the state did not raise the issue of exhaustion in this court. The former Fifth Circuit held that a state's failure to raise lack of exhaustion in the district court generally constitutes a waiver of that requirement, as seen in Hopkins v. Jarvis, 648 F.2d 981, 983 n.2 (5th Cir. 1981), and Messelt v. Alabama, 595 F.2d 247, 250-251 (5th Cir. 1979), both adopted by the Eleventh Circuit in Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). On this precedent, we hold the state has waived the exhaustion requirement, allowing us to address the merits of appellant’s claim without remand (Reference case 683 F.2d 1332). Accordingly, no reversible error is present on this issue.

The judgment denying appellant’s petition for habeas corpus is therefore AFFIRMED.

gold_text: . The Georgia Court of Appeals opinion is not clear as to whether or not this argument was raised in these specific terms on direct appeal. Appellees, however, have made no allegation of failure to exhaust state remedies. Any such challenge is therefore waived. Lamb v. Jernigan, 683 F.2d 1332 at 1335 n.1 (11th Cir. 1982); Hopkins v.
