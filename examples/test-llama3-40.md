ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Pursuant to Local Rule 7.2(d), the Court finds this matter suitable for disposition without a hearing. After reviewing Defendant’s motion and the supporting and opposing memoranda, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment.

The Court notes that Plaintiff’s claim for rescission of the First Mortgage is time-barred. As stated in Beach v. Ocwen Federal Bank, 523 U.S. 410, 118 S.Ct. 1408, 140 L.Ed.2d 566 (1998), the right to rescind under TILA completely extinguishes at the end of the three-year period. Similarly, in King v. California, 784 F.2d 910, 913 (9th Cir.1986), the Ninth Circuit held that section 1635(f) is an absolute limitation on rescission actions, barring any claims filed more than three years after the consummation of the transaction.

As for the Second Mortgage, Plaintiff obtained the loan to purchase the fee interest in the Property and does not dispute that it constitutes a residential mortgage transaction, exempt from the rescission provision under TILA. Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not provided evidence that a foreclosure process is in progress, and therefore does not meet her burden to rebut a motion for summary judgment.

The Court finds that Defendant has demonstrated that there is no genuine issue of material fact and is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the claims related to the First Mortgage and DENIES the motion on the claims related to the Second Mortgage.

gold_text: This Court finds Defendant’s argument regarding the Second Mortgage unpersuasive. First, courts have a duty to construe pro se pleadings liberally, including pro se motions as well as complaints. See Zichko v. Idaho, 247 F.3d 1015, 1020 (9th Cir.2001) (acknowledging that courts must construe pro se prisoner motions and pleadings liberally); see also Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police Dep% 839 F.2d 621, 623 (9th Cir.1988) (“In civil rights cases where the plaintiff appears pro se, the court must construe the pleadings liberally and must afford plaintiff the benefit of any doubt.”); Christensen v. CIR, 786 F.2d 1382, 1384 (9th Cir.1986) (construing a pro se taxpayer’s motion to “place statements in the record” as a motion to amend). Not only is Plaintiff acting pro se, she is also the non-moving party and therefore entitled to the interpretation most favorable to her position.
