Furthermore, the handling of negligence in this case aligns with precedent as demonstrated in cases such as *Railway Co. v. Ives*, 144 U. S. 417, and *Patton v. Southern Ry. Co.*, 82 Fed. 979. The court's role is to verify if facts presented allow an inference of negligence, which should then be deliberated by the jury. This is akin to the reasoning in *Reference case 17 Wall. 657* and *Reference case 21 L. Ed. 745*, where the railroad company's failure to replace a broken latch, a seemingly minor oversight, was deemed sufficient ground for jury consideration of negligence. Similarly, in the present case, the decision not to charge the jury in the manner requested was justified given that the determination of contributory negligence requires weighing nuanced factors, such as the lighting, the extent of the movement towards the wall, and the character of the surrounding debris. These are inherently matters for jury deliberation, not judicial determination. Thus, the court maintained its proper function by letting the jury decide on these complex and debatable facts.
