**Generation:**

The determination of the accrual date is pivotal as it dictates whether the claim falls within the two-year limitations period stipulated by the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. § 2401(b). As held in *Coska v. United States*, 114 F.3d 319, “failure to comply with the FTCA’s statute of limitations means that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the suit.” The Plaintiff's claim must be timely; otherwise, it mandates a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as seen in *Skwara v. United States*, 344 F.3d 64. Additionally, the timely filing of the administrative claim is a jurisdictional prerequisite (see *Gonzalez v. United States*, 284 F.3d 281).

The application of the “discovery rule” is relevant in determining when a claim accrues, particularly in medical malpractice cases. The rule was explored in *Kubrick*, 444 U.S. 111, where the claim accrues when the plaintiff is aware of both the injury and its cause. Despite the contention regarding the exact date of accrual, the Court must scrutinize the evidence presented to establish whether the claim filed on June 29, 2012, meets the statutory requirements. Moreover, considering *Irving v. United States*, 955 F.2d 776, government employees’ actions falling under exceptions like the discretionary function exception may affect jurisdiction.

Conclusively, the Court must decide if the presented facts sufficiently demonstrate compliance with the FTCA’s procedural mandates or if jurisdictional dismissal is warranted, referencing *Callahan*, 426 F.3d 444, and the discretionary factors in *Irving*, 955 F.2d 776.

gold_text: The consequence of not strictly complying with the timelines imposed by said statute deprives the Court of subject-matter jurisdiction over an FTCA claim. Coska v. United States, 114 F.3d 319, 323 n. 8 (1st Cir.1997); cf. Sanchez, 740 F.3d at 53-54 (1st Cir.2014) (referencing Gonzalez, 132 S.Ct. at 648). What constitutes “accrual” within the meaning of the FTCA has been the subject of much debate. “The.general rule, within the meaning of the FTCA, is that a tort claim accrues at the time of the plaintiffs injury.” Skwira v. United States, 344 F.3d 64 (citing Attallah v. United States, 955 F.2d 776, 779 (1st Cir.1992); Gonzalez v. United States, 284 F.3d 281, 288 (1st Cir.2002); and United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 117-18, 100 S.Ct. 352, 62 L.Ed.2d 259 (1979)). However, § 2401(b) is not construed to penalize a plaintiff who in good faith did not know of the existence of the injury or its cause. Therefore, the Supreme Court enacted the discovery rule to endorse this aforementioned policy. See United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 117-18, 100 S.Ct. 352, 62 L.Ed.2d 259 (1979) (creating the discovery rule for medical malpractice claims); see also Rakes, 442 F.3d at 19 (acknowledging the extension of the discovery rule beyond medical malpractice claims to the point of making it a general rule in the First Circuit). The discovery rule states that a claim accrues “once a plaintiff knows, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should know, (1) of [his or] her injury and (2) sufficient facts to permit a reasonable person to believe that there is a causal connection between the government and [his or] her injury.” Callahan v. United States, 426 F.3d 444, 451 (1st Cir.2005) (citing Skwira, 344 F.3d at 78) (emphasis provided). Therefore, the discovery rule operates as an exception to the general time of injury rule. However, the First Circuit has further qualified the aforementioned formulation of the discovery rule as follows:
