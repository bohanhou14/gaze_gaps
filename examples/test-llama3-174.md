Based on the cases 362 B.R. 846 and 364 B.R. 640, the Court finds that the Debtors' case should be dismissed under § 707(b)(1) and § 707(b)(2). The'means test' calculation of § 707(b)(2) shows that the Debtors' monthly income, after deducting their permissible expenses, is $421.49, which exceeds the $182.50 presumptive abuse threshold.

As stated in In re Wright, 364 B.R. 640, the Court begins with the determination of whether the presumption of abuse arises under § 707(b)(2). The Debtors''means test' calculation, as found in their Third Amended Form 22A, is incorrect, and they understated their current monthly income by $1,231.67. This mistake is fatal to their position, as it is fundamental that forms do not control over express statutory directives.

As stated in In re Lenton, 358 B.R. 651, the substantive question is which of the Debtors' income figures is accurate: the $5,812.74 listed on line 12 or the $4,581.07 on line 16. The Court finds that the larger income figure is accurate, as it is based on the Debtors' actual monthly income during the six months prior to the date of the commencement of their bankruptcy case.

The Court notes that the Debtors' failure to properly transpose their income figure from line 12 to line 16 is not automatically fatal to their position, as forms do not control over express statutory directives. However, the weight of the evidence in this case supports those positions advocated by the UST, and the Debtors' case must be presumed to be an abuse.

Therefore, the Court finds that the Debtors' case should be dismissed under § 707(b)(1) and § 707(b)(2). The presumption of abuse arises under § 707(b)(2), and the Debtors have failed to rebut this presumption. The Court will enter a final order dismissing the Debtors' case.

gold_text: The effect of this section is to give the Court some discretion to allow changes in the ‘means test’ equation when equity so compels. In re Castle, 362 B.R. 846, 850 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2006). But as this Court has also noted, § 707(b)(2)(B) “goes on to set this bar extremely high, placing it effectively off limits for most debtors.” In re Wright, 364 B.R. 640, 642 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2007).
