Burns further challenges the jury's inconsistent verdicts, arguing that an acquittal on the conspiracy count necessitates an acquittal on the Securities Act counts. This argument is unavailing. As reaffirmed in Dunn v. United States, "each count in an indictment is regarded as if it was a separate indictment" (284 U.S. 390, 393, 52 S.Ct. 189, 190, 76 L.Ed. 356, 80 A.L.R. 161). Consistency in the verdicts is not required (127 F.2d 976). Burns cannot escape liability merely because the jury was inconsistent.

Moreover, the court's exclusion of Reverend Alexander’s testimony regarding Burns’ prayer habits was within its discretion. The relevance of Burns' personal practices towards prayer did not bear on the material issues of fraud. The jury's concern was whether investor meetings were conducted honestly, not the personal religious habits of the defendants (320 U.S. 277).

Lastly, objections to specific instructions were not preserved for review. Per Rule 30, F.R.Crim.P., objections must distinctly state the matter and grounds (18 U.S.C.A.). Burns' blanket objections fail this requirement, leaving no instructional errors for this court to review. Examination under Rule 52(b), F.R.Crim.P., reveals no plain errors affecting substantial rights; the instructions were fair and complete.

Affirmed.
