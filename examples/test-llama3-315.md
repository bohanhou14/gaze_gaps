The defendants argue that the court should exclude the testimony of the plaintiff’s marketing expert, Dr. Charles King III. However, the court finds that King's testimony is admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

In Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), the Supreme Court established a three-part test for the admissibility of expert testimony: (1) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.

In this case, King's expert report is based on a thorough analysis of the prescription drug marketplace, internal documents, government records, sales and industry data, and scholarly studies. His conclusions are based on reliable principles and methods of economics, and he has applied them reliably to the facts of the case.

The defendants argue that King's testimony is not reliable because it is based on "unreliable" data. However, in Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co., 130 F.3d 1287 (8th Cir.1997), the Eighth Circuit held that expert testimony based on flawed data can still be reliable if the expert has properly applied the data to the facts of the case.

The defendants also argue that King's testimony is not relevant to the case because it does not directly address the issue of whether the defendants' marketing campaign caused the plaintiff's injury. However, in Simmons v. United States, 470 F.3d 1115 (2006), the Sixth Circuit held that expert testimony that is "related to the facts at issue" is admissible under Rule 702.

In conclusion, the court finds that King's testimony is admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence because it is based on sufficient facts or data, is the product of reliable principles and methods, and has been applied reliably to the facts of the case. The defendants' arguments that King's testimony is not reliable or relevant are without merit. The court will allow King to testify as an expert witness for the plaintiff.

gold_text: The defendants, broadly speaking, argue that King’s testimony is irrelevant and is not supported by proper methodology. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, a district court’s task in assessing expert evidence is to determine whether the evidence “ ‘both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.’ ” Ky. Speedway, LLC v. Nat’l Ass’n of Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc., 588 F.3d 908, 915 (6th Cir.2009) (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786). Generally, “[t]he district court must consider ‘whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid.’ ” Id. (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. 2786). But when deciding whether to admit expert testimony that relates to a social science, “the factors suggested in Daubert are not to be applied mechanically; rather, district courts are accorded wide latitude in determining the reliability of expert testimony.” United States v. LeBlanc, 45 Fed.Appx. 393, 399 (6th Cir.2002); see also United States v. Simmons, 470 F.3d 1115, 1123 (5th Cir.2006) (noting courts’ discretion in admitting testimony regarding “areas of expertise, such as the ‘social sciences in which the research, theories and opinions cannot have the exactness of hard science methodologies’ ”). The purpose of the court’s gatekeeping role “is to make certain that an expert, whether basing testimony upon professional studies or personal experience, employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.” Kumho, 526 U.S. at 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167.
