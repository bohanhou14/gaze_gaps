The district court's application of claim preclusion under Title VII warrants close scrutiny. The Full Faith and Credit Act requires federal courts to respect state court judgments, giving them the same preclusive effect they would have in the courts of the rendering state (470 U.S. 373). In Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp. (456 U.S. 461), the Supreme Court emphasized that federal courts are to first look to state preclusion laws when determining the effects of a state court judgment. Since the Illinois courts had conclusively decided the Majeske plaintiffs' claims against the FOP, the district court was correct in its conclusion that these claims, including those under Title VII, were precluded.

Further supporting this, Kremer established that § 1738 applies to Title VII claims unless Congress expressly provides otherwise. Given that there is no indication of such an exception for the Majeske plaintiffs' claims, the district court rightly adhered to the principles of full faith and credit, as detailed in 470 U.S. 373 and supported by Kremer, 456 U.S. 461.

We affirm the district court's judgment dismissing the Title VII claims on grounds of claim preclusion, consistent with the mandatory respect for state court judgments under § 1738.

gold_text: The fact that a judgment incorporates the results of a settlement, rather than being the result of full litigation on the merits, makes no difference for the application of § 1738. This, indeed, was the situation in Matsushita, where the Court expressly held that a state court judgment embodying the settlement of class action claims had to be assessed under § 1738, just like any other judgment. Furthermore, the Matsushita Court reiterated that § 1738 also applies even when the state court judgment might work to bar litigation of exclusively federal claims, as the Court had held in Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 380, 105 S.Ct. 1327, 1331-32, 84 L.Ed.2d 274 (1985). Finally, in a decision with facts close to those at hand here, the Court concluded in Kremer that state court proceedings might be issue pre-clusive in Title VII suits in federal court. 456 U.S. 461, 470-72, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 1891-92, 72 L.Ed.2d 262.
