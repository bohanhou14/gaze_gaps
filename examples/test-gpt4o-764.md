In the context of determining the appropriate valuation date for the collateral, relevant case law provides substantial guidance. Courts generally utilize the effective date of the plan as the valuation date in Chapter 11 cram-down scenarios. The bankruptcy court’s decision to value Comcast’s collateral as of the petition date, as discussed, was erroneous.

In re Seip (reference id: 116 B.R. 709) and Matter of Kain (reference id: 86 B.R. 506) affirm that for purposes of determining adequate protection and plan confirmation, the valuation should be closely associated with the plan's effective date. Moreover, precedent in In re Landing Assocs., Ltd. (reference id: 122 B.R. 288) reinforces the view that valuation must align with the plan's effective date to ensure creditors receive the indubitable equivalent of their claims.

Similarly, In re Seip (reference id: 116 B.R. 709) underscores that it would be inconsistent for the allowed secured claim to differ from the actual value of the collateral at the time of confirmation. Therefore, the confirmation date, or a date near it, is typically the appropriate reference point for valuing collateral in the context of plan confirmation, as reiterated in In re Dheming (reference id: 493 B.R. 861).

The flexible approach to valuation timing under specific circumstances in T-H New Orleans Ltd. Partnership aligns with this understanding, underscoring the need to adapt valuations to reflect the collateral's proposed use under the plan. Consequently, a re-valuation of the Agreement in alignment with these precedents is necessary.
