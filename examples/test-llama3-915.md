Based on the reference cases, it appears that the court's decision to find nondischageability of $750.00 of the secured claim of creditor Steering Federal Credit Union (Steering) arose out of the financing of the purchase of a 1988 Chevrolet truck is supported by the facts. The court found that the debtor, Thomas Donald Shelton (Mr. Shelton), had "converted to his own use or the use of Happy Valley Farm" various items, including power bucket seats, console, and chrome wheels, which he had pledged as collateral in security agreements with Steering (Reference case 56 F.3d 52).

The court also found that Mr. Shelton's retention of proceeds which should have been remitted to Steering was done deliberately and without justification, and that this constituted a willful and malicious act that caused injury to Steering (Reference case 56 F.3d 52). This finding is consistent with the principle that willful and malicious conversion is a tort that can speak for itself and is not dischargeable (Reference case 56 F.3d 52).

The court's decision is also supported by the facts, which show that Mr. Shelton had traded the bucket seats and console to his friend for a bench-type seat, removed the fiberglass cab extender and discarded it, and replaced the chrome wheels with regular wheels. Additionally, the court found that Mr. Shelton had failed to maintain insurance on the Chevrolet truck and had not informed Steering of the removal of the various items.

In conclusion, the court's decision to find nondischageability of $750.00 of the secured claim of creditor Steering Federal Credit Union is supported by the facts and is consistent with the principles outlined in the reference cases. <answer>

citations: ['56 F.3d 52', '56 F.3d 52']

gold_text: Under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6) a discharge in bankruptcy may not be had for a willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity. “Willful and malicious injury includes willful and malicious conversion, which is the unauthorized exercise of ownership over goods belonging to another to the exclusion of the owner’s rights.” In re Wolfson, 56 F.3d 52, 54, Bankr.L.Rep. P 76,545 (11th Cir.1995). It is clear here that the bankruptcy court applied a lesser standard than the “maliciousness” required by the statute. When the Congress adopted section 523(a)(6) in its present form, it expressly overruled prior case law which had used a “reckless indifference” standard. See H.R.Rep., No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5963, 6320-21; In re Held, 734 F.2d 628, 630 (11th Cir.1984) (A conversion done without a conscious intent to violate the rights of another or under a mistake or misapprehension is dischargeable even though done recklessly.)
