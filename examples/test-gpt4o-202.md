4. Government Contractor Defense

MDHI asserts the government contractor defense, contending that it should be shielded from liability under state tort law due to its role in producing military equipment per government specifications. This defense is applicable when three conditions are met: (1) the United States approved reasonably precise specifications; (2) the equipment conformed to those specifications; and (3) the supplier warned the United States about dangers known to the supplier but not to the United States (reference case 487 U.S. 500). The principle behind this defense is that liability for design defects should not be imposed if these conditions are fulfilled since it implicates the government's interest in “getting the Government’s work done” (reference case 916 F.2d 977).

In the present case, MDHI argues that it complied with precise government specifications for the OH-6A helicopter and communicated any known risks to the government. However, since neither MDHI nor Triumph overhauled the hub that failed on N468WE, and it is disputed whether MDHI's duty included providing maintenance instructions for surplus military equipment, the applicability of the government contractor defense here remains questionable and may present factual disputes necessitating jury determination.

Based on the above analysis, the Court finds the government contractor defense does not definitively bar Scott's negligence claim at this juncture.

The government contractor defense includes three conditions as set forth in Boyle v. United Tech. Corp., 487 U.S. 500, 512, 108 S.Ct. 2510, 101 L.Ed.2d 442 (1988): “(1) the United States approved reasonably precise specifications; (2) the equipment conformed to those specifications; and (3) the supplier warned the United States about the dangers in the use of the equipment that were known to the supplier but not to the United States.” The defense extends to military surplus helicopters converted to civilian use. See e.g. Skyline Air Svc., Inc. v. G.L. Capps Co., 916 F.2d 977, 978 (5th Cir.1990) (finding the defense applicable to such a helicopter).
