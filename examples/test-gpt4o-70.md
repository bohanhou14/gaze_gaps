In light of the legal precedents, it is evident that Schulze's cessation of contributions post-April 14, 1980, must be scrutinized under established labor law principles. Referring to 641 F.2d 734, the cessation of contributions without mutual consent or exhaustion of negotiations can be deemed an unfair labor practice. The Board found in similar circumstances that failure to make contributions constitutes refusal to bargain in good faith if not expressly included in bargaining proposals.

Similarly, the principles from 632 F.2d 721 reinforce that unilateral changes to employment terms, including benefit plans, without reaching a formal impasse or notifying the union, violate § 8(a)(5). Likewise, 470 F.2d 827 underscores that employers must maintain the status quo regarding contributions post-contract expiration until a legitimate impasse is reached or the bargaining obligation is terminated.

Applying these precedents, Schulze cannot unilaterally decide to stop contributions until it either reaches a bona fide impasse in negotiations or secures union consent, neither of which seems sufficiently demonstrated here by the provided facts.

When the employer and the union have bargained to impasse, the employer is then free to institute unilateral changes in terms and conditions of employment that were reasonably comprehended by the employer’s pre-impasse bargaining proposals. Clear Pine Mouldings, Inc. v. NLRB, 632 F.2d 721, 729 (9th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 984,101 S.Ct. 2317, 68 L.Ed.2d 841 (1981); NLRB v. Skywolf Sales, 470 F.2d 827, 830 (9th Cir. 1972). If Schulze and the union wer-e at impasse on April 15, 1980, if Schulze then implemented its own pension plan and ceased contributing to the IAM Plan, and if there was no other source of duty requiring Schulze to continue making contributions, then Schulze “ceased to have an obligation to contribute,” i.e. withdrew from the Plan as of that date.
