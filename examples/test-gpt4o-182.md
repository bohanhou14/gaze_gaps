Furthermore, as explained in the reference cases, a trustee must be loyal to the interests of all beneficiaries and must defend those interests scrupulously (831 F.2d 1339). The trustee's duty also includes amassing estate assets for a pro rata distribution to all creditors, ensuring no conflict of interest arises in collecting all property available under state law (831 F.2d 1339). Given these duties, any potential inadequacy in representing the creditors, including Aeron, would face a heavy burden to demonstrate deficiency (Heyman v. Exchange Nat. Bank of Chicago, 615 F.2d).

Aeron has not provided evidence to suggest a conflict exists between its interests and those represented by the trustee. The trustee's overarching responsibility to equitably distribute assets among all creditors inherently aligns with Aeron's objectives. Hence, Aeron fails to meet the burden of proving that the existing representation is inadequate.

Based on this analysis, Aeron's motion does not satisfy the criteria for intervention as of right under Rule 24(a)(2). Therefore, Aeron's appeal on this ground is denied.

B. Permissive Intervention
As Aeron does not meet the criteria for intervention as of right, the court considers whether permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)(2) is appropriate. The bankruptcy court's decision on permissive intervention is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. As the standards for permissive intervention include a common question of law or fact and the court’s discretion, the bankruptcy court found no abuse of discretion in denying Aeron’s motion based on similar interests represented by the trustee without conflicts.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the aforementioned reasons, the judgment of the Bankruptcy Court denying Aeron's motion to intervene is affirmed.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

gold_text: Aeron argues that its interests conflict with Midway’s interests because the Trustee, as a fiduciary of the estate, is obligated to attempt to direct recovery into the estate. Aeron argues that if recovery goes to the estate, as opposed to Aeron directly based on a third-party beneficiary claim, that recovery may be diluted by claims of other creditors of the estate. Aeron then disputes the authority cited by the bankruptcy judge in support of his holding that the Trustee adequately represented Aeron’s interest. The bankruptcy judge cited Koch Refining v. Farmers Union Central Exchange, Inc., 831 F.2d 1339 (7th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 906, 108 S.Ct. 1077, 99 L.Ed.2d 237 (1988), which held that a trustee in bankruptcy has a duty to bring claims on behalf of the creditors as a body. Aeron notes that Koch also emphasized that a trustee could not pursue independent claims of creditors:
