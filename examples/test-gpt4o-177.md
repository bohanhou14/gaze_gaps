The necessity of incurring costs for daily transcripts falls under 28 U.S.C. § 1920. Similar to the case in Studley, Inc. v. Gulf Oil Corp., where the ruling on transcripts was deemed a matter for the discretion of the trial judge (422 F.2d 1278), this court exercises its discretion in disallowing the costs for daily trial transcripts. The transcript was not deemed necessary for the immediate use or future reference within this case, reflecting Judge Levet’s stance in denying similar costs in prior cases where discretion played a pivotal role (cf. Farmer v. Arabian American Oil Co., 379 U.S. 227).

Reproduced documents run the risk of not meeting the criteria for necessary use if unsupported by explicit itemization or justification. Similar deficiencies were noted in the itemization issues in the case referred to by 46 F.R.D. 635, where costs for non-itemized reproductions were denied due to insufficient proof. Therefore, this court remains consistent and denies the costs related to the preparation of charts, as they lack necessary documentation for substantiation.

However, in alignment with the support demonstrated in cases like those referenced by 46 F.R.D. 635, costs associated with the taking of depositions are approved. Given the essential role depositions played in exploring the involvement of Hyman in the derivative action, these costs are deemed justified and thus should be allowed.

In summary, items (1) and (2) are disallowed due to lack of necessity and proper documentation, whereas item (3) is approved as it meets the requirement for necessary use.

gold_text: Typically a showing must be made that the action presented some particularly involved and complex factual or legal issues before the cost of a daily transcript may be recovered. See Oscar Gruss & Son v. Lumberman’s Mutual Casualty Co., 46 F.R.D. 635 (S.D.N.Y.1969), aff’d., 422 F.2d 1278 (2d Cir. 1970). No such showing is possible in this case. The court finds that the daily transcript was not “necessarily obtained” for use in this case. 28 U.S.C. § 1920.
