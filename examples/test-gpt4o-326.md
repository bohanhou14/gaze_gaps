The plaintiffs argue that the ITA's delay in completing its reviews violates the statutory deadlines. Although the ITA has clearly exceeded the one-year time limit imposed by 19 U.S.C. § 1675(a) and 19 C.F.R. 353.53a(b)(7) for completing administrative reviews, it is not precluded from requesting and obtaining current data to base its final decision. As established in Philipp Bros., Inc. v. United States, 10 CIT 76, 630 F. Supp. 1323, 1324 (1986), the schedule for completion of § 751 reviews is considered directory and not mandatory. Therefore, the appropriate recourse for the plaintiff is to enforce the statutory deadlines through a suit. Similar precedence is found in American Permac v. United States, 10 CIT 535, Slip. Op. 86-83 at 13 (Aug. 12, 1986), where the court deferred issuance of a writ of mandamus pending the timely compliance with a proposed schedule submitted by the ITA.

In this context, it is crucial to note that courts may allow the ITA to operate within certain flexibility, provided the agency substantiates its need for additional information. It aligns with Philipp Bros. and American Permac’s rationale, emphasizing enforcement over strict compliance to rigid timelines, thus granting the ITA a structured schedule for review completion (651 F. Supp. 1450).

Therefore, while Sharp's argument regarding the ITA's delay is valid, the ITA's procedural latitude in seeking supplementary data stands upheld if appropriately justified and aligned with judicial precedence (651 F. Supp. 1450).

Supp. 1450, 1455 (1986). Although the eight year delay between the publication of the ITA’s intent to conduct this review and the publication of the final results is deplorable, the appropriate action by plaintiff to avoid delay would have been a suit to enforce the deadlines.
