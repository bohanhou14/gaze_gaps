The case presented is an estate tax dispute between the plaintiff, as executor of the estate of George F. Metzger, deceased, and the United States of America. The issue is whether three inter vivos gifts made by the decedent during the year 1951, approximately 18 months prior to his death, were includable in his gross estate as gifts made in contemplation of death within the meaning of Section 811(?) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

In this case, the decedent made gifts to his son Herbert Metzger, including a 490-acre marsh land and adjoining beach property valued at $25,000, and a home purchased for the son totaling $21,838.78. He also made a gift to his daughter Anna May Timmons of 1,020 common shares of Peninsular Telephone Company valued at $40,800. The defendant contends that these gifts were made in contemplation of death, while the plaintiff argues that they were motivated by living motives.

In the context of this case, the reference cases are relevant. Specifically, United States v. Wells (283 U.S. 102) establishes the principle that a transfer is made in contemplation of death if it is made with the purpose of avoiding the tax, or as a substitute for a testamentary disposition of the property, or for any other motive associated with death. Similarly, In re Estate of Metzger (326 U.S. 630) holds that a transfer is made in contemplation of death if it is made within a period of three years ending with the date of the decedent's death, and is not shown to be made for a living motive.

In this case, the court finds that the gifts were made with a living motive, rather than with a motive associated with death. The decedent's actions and attitude indicate that he was concerned with living, not dying, and that the gifts were made to create and maintain good family relations, rather than to avoid taxes or to substitute for a testamentary disposition. Therefore, the court concludes that the gifts were not made in contemplation of death and are not includable in the gross estate of the decedent. <answer>
