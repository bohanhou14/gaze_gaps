The defense contends that the trial court's reference to "whether evidence is in the case or whether it is not in the case" implicitly commented on appellant's failure to testify, thus violating his Fifth Amendment rights. This contention is supported by *Griffin v. California*, 380 U.S. 609, where the Supreme Court held that adverse comments by prosecutors or judges regarding a defendant's silence are impermissible. Furthermore, in *United States v. Mitchell*, 438 F.2d 814, the court evaluated a similar scenario where prosecutor and judicial comments on the defendant's silence were deemed unconstitutional. The parallels between these cases reinforce the argument that the trial court's instructions in DeVyver's case may have prejudiced the jury against the appellant for exercising his constitutional right.

Therefore, based on established precedents, any inference drawn from DeVyver's silence should not have been suggested, directly or indirectly, by the court. This potential transgression warrants cautious examination, aligning with our duty to uphold the fundamental constitutional privileges of the accused.

In conclusion, while DeVyver's conviction under Section 915 stands, his third contention regarding improper jury instructions necessitates reevaluation for potential prejudicial harm, as guided by *Griffin* and *Mitchell*.

gold_text: From the above emphasized phrase, DeVyver argues that since neither he nor his co-defendant elected to testify, this type of comment indirectly and improperly focused attention upon this fact and thus violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. See Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965); United States ex rel. Mitchell v. Pinto, 438 F.2d 814 (3d Cir. 1971).
