The Railroad appeals from the district court's order enforcing an award of Public Law Board No. 1998, sustaining the claim of G.L. Choate, a former employee of the Railroad, against his dismissal from service. The district court correctly enforced the award, as it is only set aside if the Public Law Board failed to comply with the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction, or there was fraud or corruption by a member of the Board. The award must be enforced, as there is no allegation of any of these factors.

The Railroad argues that the district court erred by ordering reinstatement with back pay, rather than simply reinstating Choate to his former position with seniority. However, the award requires good faith compliance, and reinstatement with back pay is necessary to ensure compliance. In Lakeland Bus Lines, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 278 F.2d 888, the court held that an order directing reinstatement with back pay requires a good faith reinstatement. Similarly, in N.L.R.B. v. Interurban Gas Co., 354 F.2d 76, the court ruled that an employer's offer to reinstate an employee is not compliance with the terms of an award if the offer is a sham.

In this case, the Railroad's offer to reinstate Choate was a sham, as it only offered reinstatement with seniority, without providing a job or back pay. The district court correctly ordered reinstatement with back pay, as this is necessary to ensure compliance with the award. The Railroad's appeal is denied, and the district court's order is affirmed.
