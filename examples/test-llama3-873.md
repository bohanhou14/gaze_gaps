The legal cases provided outline the importance of considering the defendant's health condition in sentencing. In the case of Smith v. United States (530 U.S. 466), the court departed downwardly due to the defendant's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which was in remission. However, upon reviewing the case, the court found that the district court's legal conclusion that the defendant's condition was an extraordinary physical impairment was unclear and unreasonable.

In a similar case, United States v. Dennie (542 U.S. 296), the court addressed the issue of whether a defendant's health condition, including a weakened immune system, constitutes an extraordinary physical impairment. The court held that the district court's primary reason for departure, which was the defendant's weakened immune system, was not enough to satisfy the requirements of Section 5H1.4.

The cases highlight the importance of considering the defendant's health condition in sentencing, but also emphasize the need for clear and reasonable legal conclusions. In the case of Smith v. United States, the court vacated the defendant's sentence and remanded the case for resentencing, citing the unclear and unreasonable legal conclusion of the district court. Similarly, in United States v. Dennie, the court held that the district court's primary reason for departure was not enough to satisfy the requirements of Section 5H1.4.

In conclusion, the legal cases provided demonstrate the importance of considering the defendant's health condition in sentencing, but also highlight the need for clear and reasonable legal conclusions. When departures from the sentencing guidelines are made, it is essential that the district court provides clear and reasonable legal conclusions to support its decision.

New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). This court denied Smith's motion. Since we heard oral argument, the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, â€” U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We conclude that the extent of the downward departure by the district court in this case was unreasonable and/or clearly erroneous, whether viewed in a pre-Booker, or post-Booker, context. Id.
