The plaintiff's association with KFC has not been a happy one. Evidence proffered by KFC indicates that the plaintiff has been frequently, if not chronically, late in paying royalties to KFC. The plaintiff accepts this, but suggests that late payments were customary among franchisees, and at least in the plaintiff's case, acquiesced in by KFC. Evidence also suggests that the plaintiff was in other respects deficient in the operation of his franchise. Specifically, KFC alleges the plaintiff was late in making payments to the KFC Cooperative and operated the White Plains outlet in an "unclean" manner.

As for the Elmsford outlet, it is unclear whether under the Termination Agreement a default as to one franchise effectuates the termination of only that franchise or of both franchises. The significance of this ambiguity lies in the fact that the default at issue here pertains to only the plaintiff's obligations for one franchise—the White Plains outlet. Moreover, the default notice at issue spoke only to the White Plains franchise. In other words, it is an issue whether, under the Termination Agreement, the plaintiff's default with respect to his White Plains franchise effectuates the termination of not only that franchise, but also his Elmsford franchise.

In this case, the court may look to the case of Jacobson v. Armstrong, 548 F.2d 438 (2d Cir. 1977), for guidance. In Jacobson, the court held that a franchisee's failure to make timely payments constituted a material breach of the franchise agreement, even if the payments were not overdue by a significant amount. Similarly, in Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 429 F.2d 1197 (2d Cir. 1970), the court held that a franchisee's failure to comply with the franchise agreement's requirements constituted a valid reason for termination of the franchise.

In light of these cases, it seems clear that the plaintiff's default with respect to his White Plains franchise constituted a material breach of the franchise agreement, and that the termination of the franchise was therefore justified. Furthermore, the court finds that the balance of hardships tips in favor of KFC, as the plaintiff's failure to make timely payments has caused KFC financial harm, and the court cannot award the plaintiff an injunction that would force KFC to continue to suffer these losses. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion for

gold_text: As we indicated above, the plaintiff claims that he will lose goodwill if his franchises are terminated, and indeed that he will be put out of business. It has been held that the loss of goodwill involving the termination of a franchise or distributorship can constitute the sort of irreparable harm which will justify the imposition of a preliminary injunction. See, e.g., Jacobson & Co., Inc. v. Armstrong Cork Co., 548 F.2d 438 (2d Cir.1977) (movant who had been in business for over eight years, and who stood to lose goodwill and present and potential customers if he lost the right to distribute the defendant’s produets, showed an immeasurable harm not compensable in money). The loss or destruction of an entire business has also widely been held to constitute irreparable harm, at least when the business has been in operation for some time. E.g., Roso-Lino Beverage Distributors, Inc. v. The Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 749 F.2d 124 (2d Cir.1984) (loss of a distributorship representing eleven years of effort by a wife and husband constituted irreparable harm); Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 429 F.2d 1197, 1205 (2d Cir.1970) (right to continue a twenty-year old business not measurable entirely in monetary terms); Newport Tire & Rubber Co. v. The Tire & Battery Corp., 504 F.Supp. 143 (E.D.N.Y.1980) (reviewing Second Circuit authorities).
