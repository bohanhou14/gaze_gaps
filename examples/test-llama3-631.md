The case at hand involves a defendant who was convicted of bank robbery and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The defendant's mental competency to plead guilty and be sentenced was called into question, and the court denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and set aside his conviction.

In considering the defendant's mental competency, the court must satisfy itself that the defendant is offering the plea voluntarily and that he is competent to understand the nature of the charge, his constitutional rights, and the scope of the penalty provided by law. (Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969)). The court must also ensure that the defendant has the mental capacity to make a "reasoned choice" among the alternatives presented. (Sieling v. Eyman, 478 F.2d 211 (9th Cir. 1973)).

The defendant's history of mental illness, including repeated hospitalizations, attempted suicide, and present incoherence, raised doubts about his competency to plead guilty and be sentenced. The court's denial of the defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and set aside his conviction was error.

Furthermore, the court's failure to order a competency examination at the time of sentencing was also error. The court should have ordered an examination to determine the defendant's present mental condition and retrospectively determine his mental condition on the dates of his guilty plea and sentence. (18 U.S.C. § 4241).

In conclusion, the court's denial of the defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and set aside his conviction was error, and the court should have ordered a competency examination at the time of sentencing. The case should be remanded for further proceedings.

gold_text: Against this background it was error to proceed with sentencing, since it was apparent that appellant lacked the capacity to exercise his right of allocation, Rule 32(a), F.R.Cr.P.; United States v. Malcolm, 432 F.2d 809 (2d Cir. 1970). The proper course was to defer sentencing, pending the conduct of a court-ordered § 4244 examination and hearing to ascertain his capacity to proceed. United States v. Knohl, 379 F.2d 427, 435 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 973, 88 S.Ct. 472, 19 L.Ed.2d 465 (1967). Furthermore, having been alerted by this flurry of warning flags to the possibility that appellant might also have been mentally incompetent to plead two months earlier, the court should have directed that the § 4244 examination be expanded to determine the defendant’s competency to plead. Had that course been pursued, we would not now be faced with the necessity of ordering a retrospective examination some three years later, a procedure that is frowned upon, see Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 183, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975); Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 386, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966); Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960), but which has been followed in cases where, as here, no reasonable alternative remained. See United States ex rel. Suggs v. LaVallee, 523 F.2d 539 (2d Cir. 1975); Miranda v. United States, 458 F.2d 1179 (2d Cir. 1972); Conner v. Wingo, 429 F.2d 630 (6th Cir. 1970).
