Constitutional Claim

Petitioner’s constitutional claim hinges on alleged retaliation against him for his critical speech about the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA). He argues that his First Amendment rights were violated because his outspoken stance on DOPMA negatively impacted his application for a JAGC position.

In analyzing this claim, it is essential to consider the threshold for proving retaliation in First Amendment claims. Petitioner must demonstrate a causal link between his protected speech and the adverse action taken against him. However, the provided facts do not sufficiently substantiate this claim. While there is evidence that his critical letters were part of his application file, there is no concrete evidence indicating that his rejection was directly caused by these letters.

Reviewing similar cases, such as Novak v. Rumsfeld, 423 F.Supp. 971, 972 (D.C.Cal.1976), which emphasizes the necessity of clear evidence linking protected speech to adverse military decisions, petitioner’s claim lacks the required evidentiary support. Equally important is the recognition from case law, including Bemis v. Whalen, 341 F.Supp. 1289 (S.D.Cal.1972), that the burden of proof in such claims lies heavily on the petitioner.

Conclusion

Based on the analysis of both contract and constitutional claims, it is evident that petitioner has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. Consequently, the request for a preliminary injunction is denied.

SO ORDERED.

gold_text: In the instant case I find no basis, other than petitioner’s allegations, to conclude that any fraud or misrepresentations were practiced upon him in connection with his enlistment in the Army. I also find that the agreements petitioner entered into with the Army clearly did not promise him a JAGC position upon graduation from law school and admission to the bar. Furthermore petitioner, a college and law school student, had the capacity to read and understand these agreements. In the absence of fraud or imposition, Chalfant v. Laird, 420 F.2d 945 (9th Cir.1969), non-negligent or negligent misrepresentations, Pence v. Brown, 627 F.2d 872 (8th Cir. 1980), or ambiguity in the agreements themselves, Dubeau v. Commanding Officer, 440 F.Supp. 747 (D.Mass.1977), petitioner is bound by the contents of the agreements. It is therefore unlikely, for the purposes of this motion, that petitioner will succeed on the merits of his contract claim.
