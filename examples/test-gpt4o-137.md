CONCLUSION

Based on the evaluation of the Curtis factors and the arguments presented, it is evident that allowing the State Court Lawsuit to proceed aligns with judicial economy, avoids prejudicing other creditors, and resolves significant liability questions pertinent to each Debtor's bankruptcy case. Noteworthy parallels can be drawn with the case 642 F.3d 865, where the court recognized the importance of resolving factual and liability issues within the original forum instead of restarting litigation in the bankruptcy court. Similarly, in the current matter, proceeding with the State Court Lawsuit circumvents unnecessary delays and potential forum shopping by the Debtors.

Additionally, akin to the findings in the case 642 F.3d 865, the relief from stay will facilitate the resolution of claims that may influence the dischargeability of debts, adhering to principles of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion. Hence, this Court grants the Creditors’ motion for relief from the automatic stay, permitting the continuation of the State Court Lawsuit on the condition that enforcement of any judgment remains stayed until dischargeability is determined.

ORDERED that the Creditors’ motions for relief from stay are GRANTED as set forth above.
  
DATED this ____ day of ____________, 20___.
  
BY THE COURT:
  
Howard R. Tallman, Judge
United States Bankruptcy Court

gold_text: The Court has considered each of the applicable Curtis factors and finds that they support granting relief from stay in order to allow the State Court Lawsuit to proceed. The Court has also considered the “likelihood of success” factor applied in the case of Chizzali v. Gindi (In re Gindi), 642 F.3d 865 (10th Cir.2011), overruled on other grounds.by TW Telecom Holdings Inc. v. Carolina Internet Ltd., 661 F.3d 495 (10th Cir.2011). See In re Hruby, 512 B.R. at 270-71. As in Hruby, the Court treads lightly when it comes to rendering opinions as to a likely resolution of the factual and legal issues involved in the State Court Lawsuit, but the Court finds that the Creditors have sufficiently shown a likelihood of success that they should be allowed to proceed.
