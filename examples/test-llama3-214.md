In considering whether the Ex Post Facto Clause is violated, we must determine whether the law is retrospective, and whether it increases the penalty to which Dozier is subject. The government concedes that the retrospective requirement is met, and we agree that the application of § 3583(h) increases the potential punishment for violations of supervised release. Dozier's sentence, imposing a new term of supervised release, was not authorized at the time of his original conviction. United States v. Ratzlaf, 25 F.3d 1220.

The Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits laws that increase the penalty to which a defendant is subject. United States v. Brady, 507 U.S. 725. Here, the application of § 3583(h) increases the potential punishment for violations of supervised release, as it allows for the imposition of a new term of supervised release, whereas prior to its passage, Dozier would have been free of all supervision following any incarceration. This increase in punishment is a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.

The government argues that the court must balance the detriments to Dozier against the fact that the court must sentence Dozier to less than the maximum period of incarceration if it wishes to impose a new term of supervised release. However, this reasoning cannot justify retrospective application of § 3583(h) to Dozier. The possibility that post-3583(h) sentences may frequently be less onerous than otherwise is insufficient to redeem the statute.

We conclude that the application of § 3583(h) violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, and we vacate Dozier's sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing. United States v. Dozier, 25 F.3d 1220.

We ask (1) whether there was an error, (2) that was plain, i.e. “clear” or “obvious,” (3) that affected substantial rights, and (4) that calls for the exercise of our discretion to take corrective action because the error creates a miscarriage of justice or seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.
