E. Mann also challenges the district court’s application of 28 U.S.C. § 157(b) in determining that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to hear his case. He argues that the bankruptcy court overstepped its bounds since the foreclosure matter was not a core proceeding but rather a related one. However, as seen in **DuVoisin v. Foster (809 F.2d 329)**, a non-core but related proceeding can still fall within the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction with parties' consent. Here, Mann essentially consented by engaging fully throughout the proceedings without objection.

Further, **In re Southern Industrial Banking Corp. (809 F.2d 329)**, reminds us that related proceedings with consent effectively permit the bankruptcy court to exercise jurisdiction akin to core proceedings. Mann’s conduct signified such consent, thus nullifying his argument against the district court’s jurisdiction finding.

F. Mann additionally claims that the scope of bankruptcy court jurisdiction was exceeded since only core matters under 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2) should be adjudicated there. Yet, **In re Salem Mortgage Co. (783 F.2d 626)** emphasizes Congress's intent for broad jurisdiction in matters connected with bankruptcy cases. The litigation involving Mann and ADI clearly fits this broader interpretation as it is inherently tied to Mann's bankruptcy context.

Given the established consent and the intended broad jurisdictional scope, Mann's jurisdictional challenge fails.

IV. Conclusion
For the reasons articulated, Mann’s appeal is denied, and the district court’s judgments are affirmed. ADI’s request for attorney’s fees is remanded to the bankruptcy court for determination.

gold_text: . Bankruptcy courts may hear two categories of proceedings: core proceedings as defined in 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2), and non-core proceedings that are "otherwise related to a case under title 11.” Id. § 157(c)(1). The latter category is very broad, DuVoisin v. Foster (In re Southern Indus. Banking Corp.), 809 F.2d 329, 331 (6th Cir.1987), including nearly every matter directly or indirectly related to the bankruptcy. But see Kelley v. Nodine (In re Salem Mortgage Co.), 783 F.2d 626, 634.(6th Cir. 1986) (28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(1) does not include proceedings involving transactions or events with only "an extremely tenuous connection” to the bankruptcy).
