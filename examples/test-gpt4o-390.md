In addition to our primary findings, we address relevant case law that further supports our decision. In Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, the Supreme Court emphasized the value of cross-examination in establishing the reliability of testimony. In Roberts, the Court stated that an adequate opportunity for cross-examination provided sufficient "indicia of reliability" necessary under the Confrontation Clause. However, this precedent is not applicable here, as Feldman and Martenson were neither given adequate notice of the criminal implications of Sanburg’s deposition nor a meaningful opportunity for cross-examination.

Furthermore, the government’s reliance on United States ex rel. Haywood v. Wolff, 658 F.2d 455, is misplaced. In Haywood, the court acknowledged that prior testimony could be deemed reliable if corroborated by external evidence. However, the circumstances of Sandburg’s deposition — particularly the undisclosed agreement and lack of corroborative evidence for critical parts of his testimony — render it of dubious reliability. Thus, these precedents bolster our conclusion that the admission of the deposition infringed upon the defendants' Sixth Amendment rights.

Overall, the combination of statutory violations under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) and the Confrontation Clause principles necessitates a retrial. The procedural and constitutional shortcomings observed here affirm the need to reverse the district court's judgment.

gold_text: The Sanburg deposition was the heart of the prosecution’s case against the co-defendants. At the time of the deposition, however, no criminal charges were pending against Feldman and Martenson, they had no reason to suspect that they should cross-examine Sanburg, and there was no party at the deposition who could be deemed a predecessor in interest to Feldman or Martenson. The trial court therefore erred in admitting the deposition under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1). The admission of the deposition also violated the Confrontation Clause because the deposition did not bear sufficient indicia of reliability as articulated in Ohio v. Roberts, 1980, 448 U.S. 56, 65-66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, 607-08, and in United States ex rel. Haywood v. Wolff, 7 Cir.1981, 658 F.2d 455, 463, cert. denied, 1981, 454 U.S. 1088, 102 S.Ct. 649, 70 L.Ed.2d 625. We therefore reverse the convictions of the defendants. We also find reversible error in the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(2) (1982) because the RICO count in the new indictment pushed the indictment beyond the “same offense” contemplated in id, § 3161(h)(6). We reject the co-defendants’ remaining arguments on appeal. The convictions of the co-defendants are therefore REVERSED and the cause REMANDED for a new trial consistent with this opinion.
