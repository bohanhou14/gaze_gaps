gold_text: In addition to setting the standard for effective representation of trial counsel, Strickland v. Washington sets the standard for effective assistance of appellate counsel. See, e.g., Mayo v. Henderson, 13 F.3d 528, 533 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 820, 115 S.Ct. 81, 130 L.Ed.2d 35 (1994). Such counsel is not required to raise each and every issue and each and every appellate level. Instead, it is reasonable for appellate counsel to focus on stronger arguments. It is not the province of the habeas court to “second guess the reasonable professional judgments of appellate counsel as to the most promising appeal issues.” Avincola v. Stinson, 1999 WL 557965 * 12 (S.D.N.Y.1999); see Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 754, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983). Appellate counsel’s failure to raise certain issues can only amount to ineffective assistance of counsel if “significant and obvious” issues were abandoned while “clearly and significant weaker” issues were pursued. Mayo v. Henderson, 13 F.3d at 533.
