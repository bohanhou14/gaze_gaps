**Generation:**

First, appellant’s belated attempt to abandon claims (2) and (3) is insufficient. Unlike in Rock v. Coombe, 694 F.2d 908 (2d Cir. 1982), where the petitioner’s express abandonment of unexhausted claims while on appeal avoided a remand, appellant here merely mentioned his willingness to abandon claims in a footnote and at oral argument. This does not amount to the “express and unambiguous abandonment” required (712 F.2d 1220). Therefore, the district court must properly formalize the abandonment process.

Second, examining the procedural posture and the need for thorough consideration at the lower level, remanding the case for formal dismissal is appropriate (687 F.2d 655). Given that the district court was not initially apprised of all procedural arguments and this issue’s state law intricacies, a remand will ensure a proper and comprehensive disposition of the case. This alignment with Rose v. Lundy’s mandate ensures no substantial delay in ultimate resolution.

Consequently, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss the petition due to appellant’s failure to exhaust state remedies for claims (2) and (3). Appellant may choose to file a new petition excluding the unexhausted claims if he so desires.

gold_text: First, in Rock, supra, we stated that “[w]here the petitioner has not clearly and unambiguously abandoned his unexhausted claims at either [the trial or appellate] level, we have remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with Lundy.” Id. at 914 n. 5 (citing Gulliver v. Dalsheim, 687 F.2d 655, 659 (2 Cir.1982)). In the instant case, appellant did not unequivocally abandon his claims at either the trial or the appellate level. At the district court level, he asserted that the claims were exhausted. The district court, after accepting appellant’s assertion, proceeded to rule on all the claims on their merits. On appeal, appellant has stated only conditionally that his claims would be withdrawn, that is, on the condition that we were to find the claims to have been unexhausted. As in Shears v. Israel, 712 F.2d 1220, 1222 (7 Cir.1983), the district court “considered and decided on the merits one of the unexhausted claims”. Thus, “abandonment of that claim at this stage would be more than a formal gesture.” Id.
