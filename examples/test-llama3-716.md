The case at hand involves a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, and possession with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and 18 U.S.C. § 2.

The defendant, Clarke, appeals his convictions, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal made pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. He contends that the Government failed to prove that he was a member of the conspiracy and that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he possessed cocaine with intent to distribute.

In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we apply the standard set forth in United States v. LeCroy, 441 F.3d 914, 924 (11th Cir.2006), which states that "the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the government, with all inferences and credibility choices drawn in the government's favor." We also consider the evidence necessary to establish a conspiracy, as stated in United States v. Toler, 144 F.3d 1423, 1426 (11th Cir.1998), which requires an agreement between the defendant and one or more persons, the object of which is to do either an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means.

In this case, the evidence shows that Clarke made statements to an undercover DEA agent that he wanted to distribute cocaine and that he could receive a shipment of drugs at the BBT warehouse in Atlanta, which turned out to be the conspirators' headquarters. He also participated in the ongoing cocaine trafficking at the warehouse. These facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, support an inference that Clarke was a member of the conspiracy and that he possessed cocaine with intent to distribute.

The Government also relies on the principle that "participation in a criminal conspiracy need not be proved by direct evidence; a common purpose and plan may be inferred from a 'development and collocation of circumstances,'" as stated in Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In this case, the evidence shows a development and collocation of circumstances that support an inference that Clarke was a member of the conspiracy.

Leonard, 138 F.3d 906, 908 (11th Cir.1998). Under 18 U.S.C. § 2, “Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.” Clarke could be found guilty of the possession with intent to distribute offense even though he may not have actually possessed cocaine, but, instead, simply aided or abetted one or more co-conspirators in committing the offense. United States v. Perez, 922 F.2d 782, 784-85 (11th Cir.1991). As we have held:
