Phillips argues that the absence of contamination on the class members' properties undermines their nuisance claim. They assert that without tangible evidence of pollution across the class land, the requirements of commonality and typicality under Rule 23 are not satisfied. 

In assessing the physical impact and economic loss claims, the courts have traditionally required direct physical impact, unless exceptions apply. In Pruitt v. Allied Chemical Corp., 523 F.Supp. 975 (E.D.Va.1981), referenced as 51 F.3d 417, recovery was allowed for pure economic loss without direct physical impact due to the public reliance on marine life that had been polluted. However, Pruitt stands as an exception, applicable in instances where the business relies heavily on a public resource.

In contrast, the plaintiffs here do not derive their livelihood from a public resource like commercial fishermen did in Louisiana ex rel. Guste v. M/V Testbank, 752 F.2d 1019 (5th Cir.1985), which does not provide a direct parallel to the present case. The court needs tangible evidence such as contamination on the properties in question, as discussed in reference case 989 F.2d 822, which stresses the necessity for demonstrable injury for class certification.

Thus, without concrete proof of the pollutants spreading beyond the Phillips site into the class members' properties, the district court's certification appears speculative and not in line with established legal precedent.

gold_text: A number of other courts have addressed the significant question of whether nuisance law requires a physical invasion onto property. While applying the nuisance law of Virginia, the Fourth Circuit questioned “whether property owners may recover for the diminution in the value of their property and their reasonable fear of negative health effects resulting from the proximity of their property to an environmental hazard such as an underground oil spill.” Adams v. Star Enter., 51 F.3d 417, 421-22 (4th Cir.1995). In Adams, the court decided that concerns that environmental contamination might spread and cause property values to decrease were not enough to overcome the legal requirement that a nuisance be visible or “capable of physical detection from the plaintiffs property.” Id. at 422, 423. Similarly, in a case involving dumping of manufacturing waste materials, the Fifth Circuit concluded in applying Mississippi law that the evidence “failed to show harmful levels of any toxic or hazardous substance in the [plaintiffs] well water.” Berry v. Armstrong Rubber Co., 989 F.2d 822, 828-29 (5th Cir.1993). The plaintiffs could not show any invasion of their property entitling them to recovery on their nuisance claim. Id. at 829.
