In support of this decision, the Court references the Eleventh Circuit precedent in Norman v. Housing Authority of Montgomery, 836 F.2d 1292 (11th Cir. 1988). In Norman, the court adopted the lodestar approach for determining the reasonableness of attorney fees, which involves calculating a reasonable hourly rate and multiplying it by the hours reasonably expended. This method excludes excessive or redundant hours and time spent on unsuccessful claims. Additionally, Norman allows for fee adjustments based on the results obtained.

Furthermore, the Court considers the principles outlined in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974). The Johnson case lists twelve factors useful for determining reasonable attorney fees, including the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the issues, and the customary fees for similar work in the locality.

Applying these principles, the Court finds Mr. Royals' request for $1,500 per case unreasonable given the simplicity and minimal time required for these cases. Instead, a fee of $1,000 per case, based on an hourly rate of $150 for approximately 6.6 hours, is appropriate. This ensures compliance with the professional obligation to request only reasonable fees while reflecting fair compensation for the work performed.

The Trustee's objection is thus sustained, and the attorney fees are adjusted accordingly.
