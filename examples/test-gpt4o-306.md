**Generation:**

The IJ’s determination that economic hardships, routine visits by village cadre, and brief detention do not rise to the level of persecution is consistent with precedent. For instance, in the case addressed in 92 F.3d 985, the court determined that fearing punishment for illegal departure does not equate to persecution, especially if the fear is based on economic concerns rather than protected grounds such as political opinion. Similarly, in Wang's situation, no substantial evidence was presented that her punishment aligns with grounds protected under asylum law.

Regarding fears related to illegal departure, we reference 119 F.3d 1055, which highlights that generally, violations of exit laws without political motives do not qualify an individual for asylum. Wang's departure appears tied to economic motives, as she indicated her parents wanted her to “earn money” in the U.S. This mirrors the referenced case where fear of punishment by smugglers for unpaid debts is not equated with persecution on protected grounds (92 F.3d 985).

In conclusion, substantial evidence supports the IJ’s decision to deny Wang's asylum claim, affirming that economic difficulties and ongoing but non-threatening contacts by officials do not constitute persecution. Hence, no reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to overturn the IJ’s findings based on the presented evidence and referenced case law.

gold_text: As to the second basis for her alleged fear, although there is some evidence that Chinese individuals who illegally departed may be subjected to administrative detention or, in rare cases, fines upon their return, there is not sufficient evidence that Wang would be in that position if returned to China. “[Potential prosecution for violating [China’s] illegal departure law on its face does not give rise to a fear of persecution. ...” Si v. Slattery, 864 F.Supp. 397, 406 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (cited in Chang v. I.N.S., 119 F.3d 1055, 1063 (3d Cir.1997)); see also Li v. I.N.S., 92 F.3d 985, 988 (9th Cir.1996) (“Criminal prosecution for illegal departure is generally not considered to be persecution.”). There is nothing in this recoi'd to suggest that Wang will be prosecuted for her illegal departure while other violators will not.
