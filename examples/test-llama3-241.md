The case revolves around Sean Theodore Brehm, a South African citizen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges of assault resulting in serious bodily injury. The incident occurred at Kandahar Airfield, where Brehm was employed by DynCorp International LLC, a military contractor. Brehm was charged with violating the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA), which allows the United States to exercise criminal jurisdiction over its citizens and employees abroad.

Brehm argued that MEJA was unconstitutional as applied to him, claiming that he did not have a sufficient connection to the United States to justify criminal jurisdiction. He also contended that the assault was not committed in furtherance of his employment and was therefore not covered by MEJA.

The court rejected Brehm's arguments, citing the express authority granted to Congress by the Constitution to raise and support armies and to make laws necessary and proper to that end. The court also noted that the American presence at Kandahar Airfield was regulated by an agreement between the United States and Afghanistan, which authorized the United States to exercise criminal jurisdiction over its personnel.

The court drew parallels between this case and others, such as United States v. Davis, 905 F.2d 245, and United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, where the courts found that the defendants' actions had a sufficient connection to the United States to justify criminal jurisdiction.

In conclusion, the court held that MEJA was constitutional as applied to Brehm, and his conviction was affirmed.

gold_text: . The proposition that federal crimes are punishable though committed outside of the United States is not controversial, at least insofar as such prosecution is consistent with the law of nations and so long as the enactment evidences Congress's intent to extend its extraterritorial reach. See United States v. Bowman, 260 U.S. 94, 97-98, 43 S.Ct. 39, 67 L.Ed. 149 (1922). Indeed, in certain instances, Congress has been held unbound by international law, see United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 86 (2d Cir.2003), and its silence on extraterritoriality not determinative with respect to " 'criminal statutes which are, as a class, not logically dependent on their locality for the Government’s jurisdiction,’ ” id. (quoting Bowman, 260 U.S. at 98, 43 S.Ct. 39).
