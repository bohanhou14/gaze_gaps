The reference case of United States v. Ronning, 101 F.3d 1046, provides guidance on the exercise of management responsibility over a criminal organization's property, assets, or activities. In this case, the court held that an upward departure may be warranted if a defendant exercises management responsibility over a criminal organization's property, assets, or activities, even if they did not organize, lead, manage, or supervise other participants in the offense.

In the context of this case, the court's finding that Bapack was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in a criminal activity supports the enhancement of her sentence under section 3B1.1(c) of the Guidelines. The court's finding that Bapack was involved in more than minimal planning also supports the enhancement of her sentence under section 2F1.1(b)(2)(A) of the Guidelines.

The case of United States v. Giraldo, 111 F.3d 21, suggests that a defendant's role in the offense is determined

gold_text: . The Commentary recites that "[a]n upward departure may be warranted, however, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead, manage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.” Guidelines Manual, § 3B1.1 application note 2. Because the district court indicated that it was adjusting Bapack's sentence, rather than upwardly departing, however, we cannot affirm the sentence on the basis of her evident role 'in exercising "management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of” the Corporation. See United States v. Jobe, 101 F.3d 1046, 1048 (5th Cir.1996) ("As the district court did not order an upward departure, this ground of enhancement is unavailable to sustain the enhancement on appeal.''), cert. denied - U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 81, - L.Ed.2d - (1997); but cf. United States v. Giraldo, 111 F.3d 21, 24 (5th Cir.1997) (although sentencing judge improperly relied on asset management theory to adjust sentence instead of upwardly departing, court declined to vacate sentence because evidence also supported adjustment making Guidelines application error harmless).
