The reliability of Shanks’ in-court identification is further supported by two pertinent factors. Firstly, the immediate circumstances surrounding the pretrial photographic identification display consistency with Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, which established the permissible range of such identification processes. The procedure used, including the diversity of the 15 photographs and the time elapsed since the robbery, was not "so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identity" (Simmons, supra).

Secondly, an independent source for the in-court identification can be found in Shanks’ interaction with the assailant during the robbery. As in reference case 419 F.2d 695, where in-court identification was upheld due to an established independent basis, Shanks’ close proximity to the unmasked assailant amid ample lighting over a considerable duration provided a robust foundation for subsequent identification. In 414 F.2d 1176, the court emphasized the notion that the opportunity for accurate observation significantly mitigates the risk of misidentification.

Given these considerations, alongside the affirmed procedural propriety as witnessed in Clemons v. United States, 408 F.2d 1230 (1968), the in-court identification by Shanks withstands the due process scrutiny. Consequently, aligning with precedent and the factual matrix presented, the appellant's convictions are affirmed.

Affirmed.
