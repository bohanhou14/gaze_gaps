The case at hand is an opinion and order denying a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed by Curtis Gibson, a prisoner in the custody of the State of New York. The petition alleged that Gibson's conviction was unconstitutional due to errors in the admission of evidence and the exclusion of exculpatory evidence.

Regarding the admission of evidence, Gibson claimed that his October 14, 1997 statement to the police was made without a Miranda warning, in violation of his constitutional rights. However, the court held that the statement was made in a non-custodial setting and that Gibson was not subjected to any added constraints beyond those of ordinary incarceration. This finding is consistent with the holding in Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292, 110 S.Ct. 2394, 110 L.Ed.2d 243 (1990), and New York State case law, including People v. Alls, 83 N.Y.2d 94, 608 N.Y.S.2d 139, 629 N.E.2d 1018 (1993).

As for the exclusion of exculpatory evidence, Gibson claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to admit evidence that Moore and Brown had earlier confessed to committing the crime. However, the court held that the evidence was inadmissible hearsay and would confuse the jury, citing United States v. Mullens, 536 F.2d 997 (2d Cir.1976).

Gibson also claimed that a fellow inmate's decision to reveal a conversation to the police was unconstitutional, but the court held that a prisoner has to risk that their conversations with other inmates may be recorded and may be provided to the police, citing Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427, 439, 83 S.Ct. 1381, 10 L.Ed.2d 462 (1963).

In conclusion, the court's findings and holdings are consistent with established case law, including Illinois v. Perkins, People v. Alls, and Lopez v. United States. Gibson's claims of constitutional error are without merit, and his petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.

gold_text: The District Attorney’s assistance to Almond did not violate petitioner’s rights under the Constitution. The evidence that the informant was paid involves testimony that his cooperation was noted to authorities, who considered his applications favorably for conjugal visits, work release, and favorable parole treatment; and that he was given cash assistance in moving his residence. The federal antibribery statute that petitioner alleges was violated by this conduct is. inapplicable to state officials and inapplicable to sentencing deals with witnesses for their cooperation in a prosecution. See United States v. Randolph, 230 F.3d 243 (6th Cir.2000) (indicating that the statute does not apply to deals for leniency); United States v. Albanese, 195 F.3d 389 (8th Cir.1999) (indicating that the statute does not prohibit payment from prosecutor to witness when issue is presented to and explored before jury). Furthermore, the facts presented do not show bribery.
