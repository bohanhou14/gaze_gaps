In this case, it is clear that the insurer, Liberty Mutual, has a duty to defend the suit brought against Power Products, as the complaint alleges facts that would have supported a recovery covered by the policy. As stated in Lee v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 2 Cir., 178 F.2d 750, 751-753, the insurer's duty to defend depends on whether under any of the allegations of the pleadings it might be so covered. In this case, the second count of the complaint charges the assured, Power Products, with negligence, which is a hazard covered by the policy.

It is also noted that the complaint does not explicitly allege that the motor was defective when it left the hands of Power Products, but it does not allege that it was not then defective either. In Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Travelers Insurance Co., 7 Cir., 261 F.2d 774, the Court said that "the insurer’s obligation to defend is clear solely from an examination of the complaint" (p. 777).

Furthermore, the policy and endorsement in question define "insured" as including persons driving with the consent of Power Products as well as Pearson himself, which is similar to the situation in Powell Plumbing Heating, Inc. v. Merchants Mutual Casualty Co., which is on all fours with the case at bar.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of the complaint and the policy, it is clear that Liberty Mutual has a duty to defend the suit brought against Power Products, at least until it can be determined that the claim is not covered by the policy.
