Based on the provided reference cases, specifically 16 M.J. 397 and 16 M.J. 393, it appears that the legal issues at hand involve the concept of unlawful command influence, multiplicity, and the role of the convening authority in the court-martial process.

In the case of 16 M.J. 397, the Court of Military Appeals (CMA) ruled that the presence of unlawful command influence within the 3d Armored Division did not prejudice the appellant's findings or sentence. The CMA noted that the scope of the influence only extended to potential character witnesses, and that the appellant's pleas of guilty were unaffected by the influence.

In a similar vein, the CMA in 16 M.J. 393 held that the failure to dismiss included offenses did not constitute plain error, as the language of the specifications did not fairly embrace the included offenses. The CMA also emphasized that the test for providence should focus on whether the presence of command influence would have affected the accused's pleas, and that the record of trial demonstrated that the military judge conducted a searching inquiry into the accused's plea of guilty.

Applying these principles to the current case, it appears that the presence of unlawful command influence within the Division may have affected the appellant's decision to plead guilty. However, the CMA's decisions in 16 M.J. 397 and 16 M.J. 393 suggest that the appellant did not suffer prejudice as a result of the influence.

Furthermore, the CMA in 16 M.J. 397 emphasized the importance of the post-trial review conducted by the convening authority, and noted that the accused is entitled to a careful and individualized review of their sentence. In this case, General Anderson's comments on military justice were stated in general terms and did not espouse personal interest in the outcome of any particular case. Therefore, he was not disqualified from participating in the referral process.

In conclusion, based on the provided reference cases, it appears that the legal issues at hand involve the concept of unlawful command influence, multiplicity, and the role of the convening authority in the court-martial process. While the presence of unlawful command influence may have affected the appellant's decision to plead guilty, the CMA's decisions in 16 M.J. 397 and 16 M.J. 393 suggest that the appellant did not suffer prejudice as a result of the influence.

gold_text: Appellant also contends the two specifications alleging possession and distribution of a like amount of marijuana are multiplicious for findings purposes. We disagree. In testing for multiplicity, we need not go beyond the language of the specifications. United States v. Glover, 16 M.J. 397 (C.M.A.1983); United States v. Holt, 16 M.J. 393 (C.M.A.1983). Since the language of the distribution specifications do not “fairly embrace” the specifications alleging possession, no relief as to findings is required.
