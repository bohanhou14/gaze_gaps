In addition to considering the government's trial preparation, it is essential to evaluate whether Marroquin's timely plea facilitated the efficient allocation of judicial resources. The purpose of U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b)(2) is to incentivize defendants to plead guilty early enough to allow the court to manage its resources effectively and avoid unnecessary expenditures (United States v. Schau, 1 F.3d 729, 731 (8th Cir.1993); United States v. Donovan, 996 F.2d 1343, 1345 (1st Cir.1993)). 

The district court noted that trial calendar notices had already been issued prior to Marroquin’s plea, suggesting inefficiency. However, Marroquin's plea, entered promptly after substantial plea negotiations, spared the court from conducting a potentially lengthy and complex trial. The First Circuit has affirmed that pleas on the eve of trial do not necessarily help avoid judicial resource expenditure (United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872 (1st Cir.1993)).

Moreover, Marroquin filed his pre-trial motions within a reasonable timeframe, contributing to the court’s understanding and management of the case early on. The efficient handling of judicial resources also reflects that substantial trial preparations were not undertaken by either party before Marroquin's plea. This context diverges from cases where belated pleas did not merit reductions due to already-completed significant trial preparations (case reference 27 F.3d 1409). Hence, the district court's denial of the one-level decrease appears misaligned with the overarching aims of § 3E1.1(b)(2).

In summary, given the timely nature of Marroquin’s plea and the limited trial preparations, denying the decrease under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b)(2) constitutes an error. We reverse the district court’s decision and remand for resentencing in alignment with these findings.

gold_text: A district court may certainly deny a one-level decrease to “a defendant who withholds a guilty plea until he stands poised on the brink of trial.” Morillo, 8 F.3d at 872; see also United States v. Kimple, 27 F.3d 1409, 1413 (9th Cir.1994); United States v. Donovan, 996 F.2d 1343, 1345 (1st Cir.1993). We do not face that situation here. Marroquin gave notice of his intention to plead guilty on April 4. The court set a calendar call for April 13, on which date it apparently planned to set a specific trial date.
