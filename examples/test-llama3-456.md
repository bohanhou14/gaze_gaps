The case at hand revolves around the issue of whether the Copyright Act of 1978 applies retrospectively to agreements entered into prior to its effective date. The plaintiff, June Roth, argues that the 1978 Act should be applied retroactively, as it provides a more favorable outcome for her. However, the defendants, Patrick McGrady and Nathan Pritikin, contend that the 1978 Act does not apply retrospectively and that the original agreement between Roth and McGrady is still valid.

The court notes that the Copyright Act of 1978 was not intended to apply retrospectively, citing the legislative history of the Act and the language used in Section 301. The court also points out that the Act was made effective on January 1, 1978, which suggests that Congress did not intend for the Act to apply retroactively.

Furthermore, the court relies on the principle that a statute will not be interpreted to apply retrospectively unless it is the "unequivocal and inflexible import of the terms, and the manifest intention of the legislature." (Reference: Union Pacific R.R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., 231 U.S. 190, 199 (1913)). The court concludes that the 1978 Act does not apply retrospectively and that the original agreement between Roth and McGrady is still valid.

In reaching this conclusion, the court also cites the decision in May v. Morga-nelli-Heumann & Assoc., 618 F.2d 1363, 1368 n. 4 (9th Cir. 1980), which held that the 1978 Act does not apply retrospectively to agreements entered into prior to its effective date. The court also notes that Professor Nimmer, a noted authority on copyright law, agrees that the 1978 Act does not affect the ownership rights of persons holding copyrights prior to January 1978.

Finally, the court notes that if the 1978 Act were to be applied retroactively, it would raise serious constitutional issues, including the possibility of an unconstitutional taking. (Reference: Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 43 S.Ct. 158 (1922); Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646 (1978)).

In conclusion, the court holds that the Copyright Act of

Even the spectre of a constitutional issue concerning the proper application of the “takings clause”, however, is sufficient cause to construe the statute to provide for exclusively prospective relief, particularly in the absence of any clear congressional mandate to the contrary.
