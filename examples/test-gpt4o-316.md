**Generation:**

The district court's granting of summary judgment in favor of the State aligns with precedent, reinforcing that a regulation imposing a minimal burden on constitutional rights need only be rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Dudum v. Arntz, 640 F.3d 1098, provides a relevant benchmark for assessing state authority to structure election processes, emphasizing that statutory interventions requiring judicial notice are permissible when derived from governmental sources whose accuracy is undisputed (640 F.3d at 1105-06). Additionally, the analysis should consider the broader election scheme, not isolated provisions, as delineated in relevant precedents (Nat’l Educ. Assn., 629 F.3d 992).

By citing Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., we recognize the applicability of documents incorporated into complaints (629 F.3d at 998-99). In this instance, the voter registration statute is part of a comprehensive system that supports major and minor party access to ballots without undue restriction, sustaining a rational basis for differentiating form content (629 F.3d at 1217). Therefore, we find Arizona’s § 16-152(A)(5) constitutionally valid as it minimizes administrative errors and aligns with state interests, reflecting principles established in these authoritative cases.

AFFIRMED.
