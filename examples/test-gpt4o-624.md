**Generation:**

We disagree with the district court's conclusions. In Sayre v. Anderson, 238 F.3d 631, 634 (5th Cir. 2001), the court noted that claims of a failure to testify are insufficient without demonstrating the content and potential impact of the testimony. Harris, like Sayre, fails to show a reasonable probability that his testimony would have led to a different result. Additionally, in Mullins, 315 F.3d 449, it was emphasized that counsel's strategy must be thoroughly unjustifiable to meet the Strickland standard.

Here, Williams’s decision not to have Harris testify can be seen as a strategic choice aimed at avoiding cross-examination that could further incriminate him, given Harris’s prior comments and actions. Even had Harris testified, the overwhelming evidence against him, including multiple witness testimonies and his own statements to the FBI, negates a finding of prejudice. Consequently, we find that Harris has not met the Strickland burden of proof to show both deficient performance and a probability of a different outcome. The district court's decision to grant habeas relief was in error.

We, therefore, reverse the district court’s grant of habeas corpus and reinstate Harris’s original conviction and sentence.

gold_text: The district court’s ruling on this issue notably omitted any discussion of Strickland, such as why Williams’s decision to counsel against Harris testifying was “objectively unreasonable” or how it prejudiced Harris. A defendant who argues that his attorney prevented him from testifying must still satisfy the two prongs of Strickland, however. United States v. Mullins, 315 F.3d 449, 452 (5th Cir.2002); Sayre v. Anderson, 238 F.3d 631, 634 (5th Cir.2001). A criminal defendant’s right to testify is well established, and only the defendant can waive this right, not his counsel. Mullins, 315 F.3d at 452. That waiver must be knowing and voluntary. Id.
