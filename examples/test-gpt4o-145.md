In considering the superiority of the class action, the Court finds that a class action is indeed the most efficient and effective manner of adjudicating these disputes. As noted in Labbate D’Alauro v. GC Servs. Ltd. Pshp., “[c]lass actions are often the most suitable method for resolving suits to enforce compliance with consumer protection laws because the awards in an individual case are usually too small to encourage the lone consumer to file suit” (168 F.R.D. 451). Similarly, in Mortimore v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., it was highlighted that the relatively small size of each individual member's claim makes it unlikely that the claims would be brought to court without use of the class action procedure (224 F.R.D. 67). Furthermore, class action adjudication will avoid duplicative lawsuits with potentially inconsistent results, hence preserving judicial resources (130 F.R.D. 295). 

Regarding the interests of the class members, the Court acknowledges the principle set forth in Hurwitz v. R.B. Jones Corp., emphasizing judicial integrity, convenience, and economy, asserting that the class members, unlikely to litigate individually due to the modest individual recovery amount, will benefit from a class action approach (168 F.R.D. 451). In line with these considerations, the Court concludes that the plaintiff has satisfied all the prerequisites for class certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23.

Therefore, the motion for class certification is granted, and the settlement class is certified as described.
