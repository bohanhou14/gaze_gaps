Based on the provided references, it appears that the "exculpatory no" doctrine, as adopted by the Eighth Circuit in United States v. Taylor, 907 F.2d 801 (8th Cir. 1990), is no longer a viable defense to a false statement charge under 18 U.S.C. § 1001. The doctrine has been weakened by subsequent legal developments, including the Supreme Court's holding in Hubbard v. United States, 115 S.Ct. 1754 (1995), which overruled United States v. Bramblett, 348 U.S. 503 (1955).

The case at hand, United States v. Raether, involves a charge of making a false statement under § 1001. The defendant's response to a question from a GSA official, Peggy Lowndes, was not a "simple exculpatory denial" but rather an affirmative misstatement. As noted in United States v. Oakar, 924 F.Supp. 232, 239 n. 7 (D.D.C.1996), a defendant who undertakes such affirmative attempts to mislead government officials is not entitled to claim the benefit of the doctrine.

Furthermore, the fact that Ms. Lowndes asked the defendant the question at the request of the FBI does not change the analysis. As held in United States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475 (1984), criminal investigations fall within § 1001, and the FBI qualifies as a department or agency of the United States.

In light of these precedents, the motion to dismiss Count II of the indictment based on the "exculpatory no" doctrine is denied. The defendant's response to the question from Ms. Lowndes was not a "simple exculpatory denial" and does not fall within the doctrine. The case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.

Our legal system provides methods for challenging the Government’s right to ask questions — lying is not one of them.” Bryson v.

[The defendant] could have refused to answer the incriminating question. Or, if he reasonably believed that he would lose his job for refusing to answer, he could have answered without waiving his fifth amendment privilege, [cited case omitted] Instead, he chose a third, unprotected response: He lied. He cannot now avail himself of the fifth amendment.
