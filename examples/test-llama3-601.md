In the context of legal cases, exhaustion is a crucial concept that ensures comity between state and federal courts. The doctrine of exhaustion requires a state prisoner to exhaust available state remedies before seeking habeas corpus relief in federal court. This concept is well-established in reference cases such as 625 F.2d 216, 564 F.2d 602, and 607 F.2d 495.

In the present case, Sweet and Henderson, state prisoners, appeal from the district court's dismissal of their petitions for writs of habeas corpus. They raise an equal protection challenge to their state convictions. However, the district court rejected their constitutional claims on the merits, citing the doctrine of exhaustion.

The doctrine of exhaustion is based on the principle of comity, which requires federal courts to defer to state courts in matters of state law. As stated in Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 204, 70 S.Ct. 587, 590, 94 L.Ed. 761 (1950), "it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation."

In this case, Sweet and Henderson failed to exhaust their state remedies. Sweet did not present his equal protection challenge to the Oregon forcible rape statute on direct appeal, nor did he pursue post-conviction relief. Henderson petitioned the Oregon Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus, but his petition was denied without opinion. The denial was not on the merits, as Henderson could have pursued post-conviction relief under the Oregon Post-Conviction Hearing Act.

Therefore, we affirm the judgments of the district court, holding that Sweet and Henderson failed to exhaust their state remedies. We emphasize the importance of exhaustion in maintaining comity between state and federal courts, as exemplified in reference cases such as 625 F.2d 216, 564 F.2d 602, and 607 F.2d 495.

Compare United States v. Hicks, 625 F.2d 216 (9th Cir. 1980) and Meloon v. Helgemoe, 564 F.2d 602 (1st Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 950, 98 S.Ct. 2858, 56 L.Ed.2d 793 (1978), with Rundlett v. Oliver, 607 F.2d 495 (1st Cir. 1979) and State v. Gray, 122 Ariz. 445, 595 P.2d 990 (1979). We note that the Supreme Court has recently granted certiorari in a case in which a state statutory rape provision was upheld by a 4 to 3 vote of the California Supreme Court. Michael M. v. Superior Court, 25 Cal.3d 608, 601 P.2d 572, 159 Cal.Rptr. 340 (1979), cert. granted, 447 U.S. 904, 100 S.Ct. 2984, 64 L.Ed.2d 853 (1980).
