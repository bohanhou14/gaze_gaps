In reference to the legal cases provided, it is essential to understand the concept of cash collateral and the rules governing its use in bankruptcy proceedings. The case of In re Bristol Assocs., Inc., 505 F.2d 1056, 1061 (3d Cir.1974), highlights the importance of recording a mortgage and assignment of rents to establish a lien. The Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code does not cover mortgages and assignments of rents, and the mortgagee's lien in rents and profits under an instrument of assignment attaches and is perfected at the moment of execution, delivery, and recordation of the instrument.

In the case of In re SeSide Co., 152 B.R. 878 (E.D.Pa.1993), it was held that a mortgagee may enforce its right to rents after the bankruptcy petition has been filed and disapproving In re Wynnewood House Assocs., 121 B.R. 716 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1990) and In re TM Carlton House Partners, Ltd., 91 B.R. 349 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1988).

In the context of the current case, the tipping fees received by a landfill operator/debtor constitute cash collateral, as they are proceeds, offspring, rents, or profits of property subject to a security interest. 11 U.S.C. §§ 363(a) and 552(b). The Court must determine whether under Pennsylvania law the tipping fees are "rents" or "profits" of real property. The clear majority of cases hold that revenues from hotel/motel room occupancy are personal property, accounts receivable, and not "rents." See e.g., In re Ashoka Enterprises, Inc., 125 B.R. 845, 846 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1990); In re Shore Haven Motor Inn, Inc., 124 B.R. 617, 618 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1991); In re Sacramento Mansion, Ltd., 117 B.R. 592, 606 (Bankr.D.Colo.1990).

In conclusion, the tipping fees received by a landfill operator/debtor are not "rents" or "profits" of real property, but rather personal property, and are therefore not cash collateral. DiFrancesco's Motion to Prohibit the Use of Cash Collateral must be denied. An Order consistent with the foregoing will be entered
