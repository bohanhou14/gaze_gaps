In the present case, Poulin challenges his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a) on two grounds. First, he argues that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to him because his conduct did not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. However, this argument is unavailing as courts have consistently held that the production of child pornography, regardless of its intended use, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce (Morales-De Jesús, 372 F.3d 6).

Second, Poulin claims that the evidence against him was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the government failed to show that he "produced" sexually explicit images of a minor using materials that traveled interstate. This argument is also without merit, as the government presented evidence that Poulin purchased camera equipment from a supplier in Texas and used it to record images of a minor (Poulin, 182 F.3d 737). The court has held that the term "producing" includes activities such as "manufacturing, issuing, publishing, or advertising" (United States v. Lacy, 119 F.3d 742).

In conclusion, Poulin's arguments are unavailing, and his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a) is affirmed. The court has consistently held that the production of child pornography has a substantial effect on interstate commerce and that the term "producing" includes a broad range of activities (United States v. Ortiz, 526 F.3d 16; United States v. Fadl, 498 F.3d 862).

gold_text: We find that Congress did not intend so technical a definition of the term “produced” as Poulin would have it. Such a holding comports with Congress’ list of assorted terms defining “producing,” along with our own precedent and that of many of our sister courts. See, e.g., id.; United States v. Ortiz-Graulau, 526 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir.2008) (interpreting § 2251(a) to require only that a visual depiction be made); United States v. Fadl, 498 F.3d 862, 867-68 (8th Cir.2007) (finding Congress intended a nontechnical definition of “producing” and sought to include activities not generally considered to fall within the typical meaning of the term); United States v. Smith, 459 F.3d 1276, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2006) (finding “producing” not unduly technical or ambiguous); United States v. Angle, 234 F.3d 326, 341 (7th Cir.2000) (rejecting restrictive definition and holding that images copied onto computer diskettes are “produced”); Robinson, 137 F.3d at 653-54 (noting evidence of photographs taken with camera and film manufactured outside of state was offered to show “production” using materials shipped in interstate commerce); United States v. Lacy, 119 F.3d 742, 750 (9th Cir.1997) (finding images copied onto computer were created and therefore “produced”). But see United States v. Wilson, 182 F.3d 737, 741-43 (10th Cir.1999) (finding images recorded onto diskettes that traveled interstate insufficient to satisfy “production” requirement).
