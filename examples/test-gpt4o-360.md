In addressing the constitutionality of Canon 7(B)(1)(c), we must examine precedents that highlight the tension between governmental regulation and fundamental constitutional rights. In Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners of N.M., 353 U.S. 232, the Court underscored the importance of protecting individual rights against arbitrary state actions, emphasizing that regulations must align with constitutional protections of free speech and due process. Similarly, in NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, the Court acknowledged the pivotal role of free expression in facilitating democratic engagement and emphasized that governmental restrictions on speech related to public issues must be narrowly tailored.

Moreover, in Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, the Court held that statutes infringing on free exercise and speech rights must not be vague and overbroad, as such statutes could unduly restrict constitutionally protected activities. Applying these principles, Canon 7(B)(1)(c) is substantially overbroad and inhibits free speech by imposing a chilling effect on judicial candidates. The Canon, therefore, fails to meet the strict scrutiny standard, as it is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, and thus, violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

In conclusion, based on both the principles enunciated in Schware, NAACP v. Button, and Cantwell, Canon 7(B)(1)(c) is rendered unconstitutional due to its overly broad restrictions on speech, lacking sufficient justification from the state.

gold_text: The Court in Mortal further emphasized that there were three “specific evils targeted” by the Louisiana canon, namely, (1) the state’s desire to prevent abuse of judicial office by a judge-candidate during the campaign, (2) to preclude the abuse of the judicial office by a judge who was defeated in the electorial bid and returned to his judicial office and (3) the desire of eliminating any appearance of impropriety by judges during and after the campaign for the nonjudicial office. It is plain that the area that the State of Louisiana sought to regulate by implementing Canon 7(A)(3) is limited with “narrow specificity.” See: N.A.A.C.P. v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 338, 9 L.Ed.2d 405; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 311, 60 S.Ct. 900, 906, 84 L.Ed. 1213. In the instant case, Canon 7(B)(1)(c) is overbroad and vague and as such, has the force and effect of inhibiting unduly protected freedoms of expression. Judge Beshear in no way was advocating any unlawful activities or seeking to breach the peace in any way. Judge Beshear was endeavoring to voice ideas and policies that he would institute, if elected, to cope with the increasing crime rate. Obviously the policies would be implemented in open court and in the presence of all interested parties and not in secrecy or in an arbitrary or oppressive manner. Indeed, neither the Commission nor the State of Arkansas may, under the pretext of prohibiting professional misconduct, ignore basic and fundamental federal rights. See: Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 752, 1 L.Ed.2d 796.
