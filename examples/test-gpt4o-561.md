**Generation:**

Given the facts and legal standards previously set forth, it is clear that determining whether the $900.00 for the furnace replacement and the $34,400.00 attributable to the $400.00 bi-weekly payments are classified as DSOs involves analyzing whether these amounts were intended as support.

1. **Furnace Replacement**:
The Family Court specifically described the furnace replacement as necessary for maintaining the marital home. Similar to the reasoning in **In re Calisoff, 92 B.R. 346, 352 (Bkrtcy.N.D.Ill.1988)**, where household appliances were considered necessary goods that provided support to the defendant, the $900.00 ordered for the furnace replacement fulfills a support function and is therefore in the nature of alimony or maintenance.

2. **Bi-Weekly Payments**:
The $34,400.00 bi-weekly payments were intended to meet the daily needs of Ms. Laureyns, echoing **In re Caughenbaugh, 92 B.R. 255 (Bkrtcy.S.D.Ohio 1988)**, which held that allocated payments that are essential for maintaining household stability are construed as support. Moreover, since these payments facilitated the upkeep of joint debts and maintained home stability, they satisfy the criteria for support under the Bankruptcy Code.

Thus, under the guidance from **Smith v. Pritchett (In re Smith), 398 B.R. 715, 721 (1st Cir. BAP 2008)**, these payments should be considered DSOs. The Debtor's obligations clearly meet the federally-defined standards for support, thus falling under priority claims per 11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(1).

Heat and hot water are necessities that clearly contribute to the well-being of one’s family. See Keeran v. Keeran (In re Keeran), 112 B.R. 881, 885 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 1990) (holding that a debt incurred in order to purchase household appliances, which are “necessary goods,” was non-dis-chargeable under § 528(a)(5) as payment on the obligation had the effect of providing support); Rich v. Rich (In re Rich), 40 B.R. 92, 95-96 (Bankr.D.Mass.1984) (finding that the debtor’s obligation to pay an unsecured home improvement loan used to fund the installation of a sewer system was a liability in nature of support such that it was non-dischargeable under § 523(a)(5)). Although not labeled as support in the initial Family Court order requiring the Debtor to make such payment, nor in the 2013 order on reconsideration of the Final Decree, the Court finds that the $900.00 debt for the furnace replacement is in the nature of support and therefore qualifies as a DSO under the Bankruptcy Code.
