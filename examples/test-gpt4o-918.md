In addition, the Debtors' proposal to contribute $30,000 from a third party’s donation fails the criteria established for new value contributions. As held in In re Potter Material Serv., Inc., a contribution must be substantial, and paying unsecured creditors ten percent over ten years does not meet this threshold (781 F.2d 99, 101). Moreover, the need for an “up front” infusion of funds as emphasized in In re Olson is unmet by this proposition (80 B.R. 935, 937).

Likewise, the court in In re Greystone III Joint Venture stressed the necessity for separate classification of claims to have sound factual support (948 F.2d 134). The Debtors’ attempts to classify the $30,000, combined with payments to unsecured creditors over an extended period, does not exhibit the requisite factual underpinning to warrant separate classification under this case’s precedent.

Thus, even acknowledging the possibility of the new value exception’s validity, the Debtors’ proposed contributions fail to satisfy the rigorous standards established both in precedent and under the absolute priority rule codified under § 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) (102 B.R. 560).

gold_text: The other component of the Debtors' proposed contribution is a $30,000 cash payment. The bankruptcy court and the district court held that the proposed payment was not substantial and therefore insufficient to qualify for the new value exception. In particular, the courts observed that the $30,000 contribution amounted to only 2.7 percent of the $1,100,-000 due unsecured creditors, and 3.3 percent of the unsecured debt owed to Farm Credit. The Debtors argue that the lower courts should not have compared the amount of the proposed contribution to the amount of unsecured debt in determining whether the contribution is substantial. Instead, they argue, to be substantial the amount contributed must be equal only to the value of the interest retained under the plan. This Court, however, has previously rejected such an interpretation of the "substantial" requirement. Stegal4 865 F.2d at 144. The requirement that a contribution be substantial is independent of the rule that a contribution must be at least equal to the value of the interest retained. See Potter Material Serv., Inc., 781 F.2d at 101. The substantiality requirement is derived not from Los Angeles Lumber `s third criterion, but from its first-that an infusion of new capital must be necessary to the success of the undertaking. Contributions that are merely nominal, or "gratuitous, token cash infusions proposed primarily to `buy' cheap financing," will not suffice. Greystone III Joint Venture, 102 B.R. 560, 575 (Bankr.W.D.Tex.1989), rev'd on other grounds, 948 F.2d 134 (5th Cir.1991); see also Stegall, 865 F.2d at 144.
