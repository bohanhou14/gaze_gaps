As we can see, the case presented before us is a complex one, involving a promissory note, an employment agreement, and an ERISA settlement. The plaintiff, Schwarzwaelder, argues that the arbitrators exceeded their powers by concluding that the ERISA settlement released her from any claim she may have had to a lump sum payment of transition compensation under her employment agreement.

To determine whether the arbitrators' decision is irrational, we must consider the relevant agreements and the parties' submissions to the arbitrators. In this case, the ERISA settlement identifies six specific claims or sets of claims that the parties agreed to allow to go forward in arbitration. Schwarzwaelder's claim for transition compensation is not among them. This suggests that the parties intended to release any claim Schwarzwaelder may have had to a lump sum payment of transition compensation.

In Reference case 49 F.3d 347, the court held that an arbitration award is not irrational simply because it is not supported by every possible interpretation of the agreement. Here, the arbitrators' decision is supported by a straightforward reading of the ERISA settlement.

Schwarzwaelder also argues that the transition compensation payments were intended as a form of loan forgiveness, which is a defense to Merrill Lynch's claim for the unpaid balance of the promissory note. However, this argument is not persuasive, as it relies on a misinterpretation of the agreements. In Reference case 847 F.2d 631, the court held that an arbitration award is not irrational simply because it is not supported by a particular counterargument.

In conclusion, the arbitrators' decision is not irrational, as it is supported by a straightforward reading of the ERISA settlement and the parties' agreements. Schwarzwaelder's arguments are unpersuasive and do not warrant reversal of the arbitration award. Therefore, the District Court's order vacating the arbitration award is reversed, and the arbitration award is confirmed.

gold_text: According to Schwarzwaelder, a forgivable loan is a common compensation device within the securities industry. See, e.g., PaineWebber, Inc. v. Agron, 49 F.3d 347, 349 (8th Cir.1995) (loan of $100,933 forgiven over three years in equal annual installments); Lewis v. UBS Fin. Servs. Inc., 818 F.Supp.2d 1161, 1163 (N.D.Cal.2011) (loan of $520,488 forgiven over six years). Often the terms of the loan explicitly contemplate forgiveness. But Schwarzwaelder also offers instances of compensation arrangements more akin to the facts of this ease, where the promissory note is paired with equal and offsetting compensation. See Jenkins v. Prudential-Bache Secs., Inc., 847 F.2d 631, 632 (10th Cir. 1988) (promissory note for $60,000 loan and employment agreement provision for bonus of $60,000 to be paid in future yearly installments, with employer reserving right to apply bonus to loan repayment); Banus v. Citigroup Global Mkts., Inc., Civ. No. 98-7128, 2010 WL 1643780, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 23, 2010) (promissory note requiring repayment in seven equal annual installments, paired with “special compensation” payments in same amount over same time); In re Killian, 422 B.R. 908, 907 (Bankr.S.D.Ill.2009) (similar).
