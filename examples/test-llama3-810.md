In the context of sexual harassment, public policy is explicit and well-defined, and it is essential to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace. As stated in EEOC Policy Guidance: Sexual Harassment, N-915.035, "prevention is the best tool for the elimination of sexual harassment. An employer should take all the steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring, such as affirmatively raising the subject, expressing strong disapproval, developing appropriate sanctions, informing employees of their right to raise and how to raise the issue of harassment under Title VII, and developing methods to sensitize all concerned" (29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(f) (1991)).

In the reference case 969 F.2d 1436, the court held that a single unwelcome physical advance can seriously poison the victim's working environment, emphasizing the importance of preventing and eliminating sexual harassment in the workplace. Similarly, in Reference case 915 F.2d 840, the court recognized that sexual harassment is a serious and insidious form of gross misconduct that can create a hostile work environment, and that employers have a duty to take all necessary steps to prevent and eliminate such conduct.

In the present case, Referee Fletcher's award ordering the reinstatement of Boynton, who had been discharged for sexual harassment, was contrary to public policy. The award did not consider the severe impact that Boynton's conduct had on Tutor's working environment, and failed to impose adequate sanctions to prevent future incidents of sexual harassment. Therefore, the court should vacate the award and instead order the Railroad to take all necessary steps to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace.

In conclusion, public policy is explicit and well-defined in the context of sexual harassment, and it is essential to prevent and eliminate such conduct in the workplace. The court should vacate Referee Fletcher's award and order the Railroad to take all necessary steps to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace.

The Railroad refers to two recent cases where arbi tral awards were vacated because they ran afoul of the policy prohibiting sexual harassment. See Stroehmann Bakeries, Inc. v.
