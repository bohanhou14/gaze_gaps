The government appeals from a judgment of the Court of Federal Claims (“Claims Court”) finding that the government breached three timber-harvesting contracts and awarding damages to Scott Timber Company (“Scott”). The government argues that the Claims Court erred in holding that the government breached its implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to notify Scott that the timber contracts were at risk of being suspended due to the Oregon Natural litigation.

The government cites the precedent of 451 F.2d 602, which holds that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not apply to pre-contract conduct. The government also argues that the notice given to Scott at the auctions in October 1998, which stated that the sales were “currently under litigation and award may be delayed,” was sufficient to put Scott on notice of the risk of suspension.

The Claims Court held that the government breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to notify Scott of the Oregon Natural litigation, but the government argues that this holding is incorrect. The government cites the precedent of Precision Pine & Timber, Inc. v. United States, 596 F.3d 817 (Fed.Cir.2010), which held that the Forest Service did not breach its implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by suspending timber-harvesting under contracts with identical suspension clauses in order to comply with a court order.

The government also argues that the Claims Court erred in holding that the Forest Service unreasonably delayed completing the surveys of the Pigout, Jigsaw, and Whitebird timber areas. The government cites the precedent of David Nassif Assocs. v. United States, 644 F.2d 4, 12 (Ct.Cl.1981), which held that the assertion of a legitimate contract right cannot be considered as violative of a duty of good faith and fair dealing.

In conclusion, the government argues that the Claims Court erred in holding that the government breached its implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and that the government's actions in suspending the timber-harvesting contracts and delaying the completion of the surveys were reasonable and justified. The government requests that the court reverse the Claims Court's decision and remand the case for further proceedings.

gold_text: We need not reach the issue of whether the Forest Service had the authority to continue the suspensions, because, as described in detail below, Scott has failed to establish that it suffered any damages. See Cosmo Constr. Co. v. United States, 451 F.2d 602, 605-06 (Ct.Cl.1971) (“[Tjhere must be some evidence of damage ... sufficient to demonstrate that the issue of liability is not purely academic; that some damage has been incurred.”); Puritan As-socs. v. United States, 566 F.2d 1191 (Ct. C1.1977) (Table) (“Even if ... the assessment of damages is reserved for the quantum phase of the case, the plaintiff as part of its proof of entitlement, must show it was damaged to some extent, by defendant’s derelictions.... ”).
