In United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, the Supreme Court outlined that federal courts should avoid unnecessary decisions on state law as a matter of comity and to ensure justice between parties. This jurisprudence establishes that if federal claims are dismissed before trial, pendent state claims should also be dismissed (383 U.S. 715, 726-27).

Additionally, in the context of disputes where state issues predominate or diverge significantly from federal claims, the state claims should be dismissed without prejudice (383 U.S. 715). This principle is echoed in the reference case 397 U.S. 397, which underscores the discretion of federal courts to retain pendent state claims if they are intrinsically linked to federal policy questions. However, if the federal claim is dismissed on mootness or other jurisdictional grounds, retaining the state claim may not be appropriate unless substantial time and resources have already been committed (397 U.S. 397).

In the current context, with Counts I and II dismissed, the pendent jurisdiction over Count III is not justified. The precedent dictates that this pendent state claim must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

In light of the aforementioned principles, the Court concludes that with the dismissal of the federal claims, Count III is also dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

gold_text: Where pendent jurisdiction provides a court with authority to hear a state claim, a court has discretion to dismiss the state claim if the federal claims are dismissed prior to trial. The Court in United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1139, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), stated that if “the federal claims are dismissed before trial, even though not insubstantial in a jurisdictional sense, the state claims should be dismissed as well.” While Gibbs seems to mandate dismissal, more recent cases indicate that it is rather a matter within the court’s discretion. See Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 404-05, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970); Houlihan v. Anderson-Stokes, Inc., 434 F.Supp. 1324 (D.D.C., 1977). Dismissal of the pendent claim is particularly appropriate here, since it occurs at an early stage of the case before extended discovery has taken place, and it promotes the policy of avoiding needless resolution of state claims in federal courts. See Houlihan, supra, 434 F.Supp. at 1330. Since it has dismissed the federal claims, the Court clearly has authority here to dismiss the pendent claim. See Marshall v. District of Columbia, 392 F.Supp. 1012, 1018 (D.D.C.1975).
