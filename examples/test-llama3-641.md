ORDER AND JUDGMENT

PAUL KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.

In this habeas corpus appeal, we consider whether the trial counsel's failure to investigate and present evidence that another person may have committed the crime was ineffective assistance of counsel. Petitioner, Moomey, argues that his counsel failed to investigate material exculpatory information from Schatz and Thompson indicating that Merritt was the killer, and failed to have the DNA collected at the crime scene compared to Merritt's DNA.

The OCCA held that counsel's conduct was within the wide range of reasonable professional conduct based on sound trial strategy. We agree. The Sixth Amendment's counsel clause is violated when counsel performs deficiently and prejudices the defense. In this case, counsel's decision not to call Merritt, Thompson, and Schatz was strategically sound. Merritt had denied responsibility for the killing, and there was no independent evidence implicating him. Thompson had motive to lie about Merritt's involvement and had failed to promptly contact authorities.

Additionally, counsel's failure to obtain DNA from Merritt and compare it to the DNA on the cigarette butt found in Walker's car was procedurally barred. A state procedural ground is independent if it relies on state law, rather than federal law, as the basis for the decision. See Klein v. Neal, 45 F.3d 1395, 1398-99 (10th Cir.1995). The OCCA properly applied the procedural bar rules and held that Moomey's claim was barred.

Therefore, we affirm the denial of Moomey's habeas petition.

gold_text: We do not consider issues on habeas review that have been defaulted in state court on an independent and adequate state procedural ground, unless the petitioner can demonstrate cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. Smith v. Mullin, 379 F.3d 919, 926 (10th Cir.2004). We have construed Oklahoma’s procedural bar as effective “to preclude habeas review of ineffective assistance claims only when ‘trial and appellate counsel differ’ and the ‘claim can be resolved upon the trial record alone.’ ” Id. at 927 (quoting English v. Cody, 146 F.3d 1257, 1264 (10th Cir.1998)). Moomey had different counsel at trial and on appeal. Further, after the state raised the procedural-bar defense in regard to the DNA-evidence/ineffective-assistance issue, Aplt. App., Vol. 7, at 2138, Moomey’s habeas counsel filed a reply completely omitting any mention of the issue or the state’s defense, id. at 2183-92. See Hooks v. Ward, 184 F.3d 1206, 1217 (10th Cir.1999) (“Once the state pleads the affirmative defense of an independent and adequate state procedural bar, the burden to place that defense in issue shifts to the petitioner.”). We conclude that the state sufficiently raised the procedural-bar defense and that Moomey conceded its applicability before the federal district court.
