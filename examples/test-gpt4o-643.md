It is required that a party must make every reasonable effort to secure from the trial court correct rulings before seeking review by an appellate tribunal, and must be distinct and specific in objections and exceptions as emphasized in reference case 15 S. Ct. 36 and 39 L. Ed. 91. In the case at bar, the defendant’s exceptions concerning the trial court’s rulings were not distinct or adequately specific, thereby failing to meet the standards set forth by Rule 4 of this court. The absence of proper exceptions precludes this court from reviewing potential errors made by the court below, as fairness dictates that issues be distinctly raised and objected to, allowing the court an opportunity for reconsideration, as highlighted in Harvey v. Tyler, 2 Wall. 328, and Moulor v. Am. Life Ins. Co., 111 U. S. 335.

Moreover, the defendant’s failure to point out specific errors in the rulings, as well as no clear exceptions taken to the instructions given by the trial judge, relates directly to the requirements underscored in these reference cases. The necessity of a strict adherence to procedural rules for objections and exceptions is critical to ensure justice and fairness to the court, echoing the sentiments in 15 S. Ct. 36 and 39 L. Ed. 91. Therefore, many of the defendant’s assignments of error lack merit as they do not conform to the procedural expectations established by previous decisions.

gold_text: The federal courts hold firmly to the doctrine that no duty rests upon the appellate court to assume the burden of relating requested instructions to those actually given in the charge, in order to determine whether the trial court was in error. For many years the rule of the Supreme Court has been that a party must make every reasonable effort to secure from the trial court correct rulings, or such as are satisfactory to him, before he will be permitted to ask any review by an appellate tribunal. To that end he must be distinct and specific in his objections and exceptions. Fairness to a trial court requires .that the attention of that court shall be specifically called to the precise point to which exception’ is taken, in order that it may have an opportunity to reconsider the matter and remove the ground of exception.
