**Generation:**



DM's argument regarding the damages award is unfounded. The district court's ruling on ownership did not affect the jury's damages award. In <281 F.3d 487>, the court held that a claimant's ownership interest in a copyright is not a factor in determining damages for copyright infringement. The court emphasized that the purpose of damages is to compensate the claimant for the loss or injury caused by the infringement, not to reward the claimant for their ownership interest.

The district court's jury instruction was also proper. The instruction informed the jury that DM did not have an ownership interest in the Whoomp! composition copyright, which is a fact that is undisputed in the record. The instruction did not imply that all royalties must go to Bell, as DM claims. Rather, it simply stated the fact of DM's lack of ownership interest, which is a relevant fact in determining the damages award.

DM's argument that the jury's damages award is rendered erroneous by the district court's ruling on ownership is without merit. The district court's ruling on ownership did not affect the jury's damages award, and the jury instruction was proper. The damages award was therefore proper and should be affirmed.
