In In re Chabot, 199 B.R. 737, the court dealt with a similar issue where the debtor had equity in their home, prior liens, and a state homestead exemption. The court allowed the debtor to avoid a substantial portion of the judicial lien by applying the legislative formula under § 522(f)(2)(A). Similarly, in Nelson v. Scala, 259 B.R. 104, the court emphasized that a judicial lien could be avoided to the extent that it impaired the debtor’s homestead exemption but maintained the lien to the value secured by the non-exempt equity.

Applying these principles, the current case falls within the same statutory and judicial alignment. Here, after accounting for the first mortgage and the homestead exemption, any remaining non-exempt equity should attribute to Antioch’s lien. Given the calculations provided, the non-exempt equity attributable to Antioch’s lien totals $47,981.40. Thus, the portion of Antioch’s lien exceeding this non-exempt value, which amounts to $85,893.60, is avoidable under § 522(f).

Therefore, considering the precedents and applying the required formula, the lien impairment must be assessed by maintaining Antioch’s priority position up to the $47,981.40 and avoiding the excess. The decision aligns with the legislative intent and prior rulings, ensuring the debtor does not unfairly displace legitimate liens through subsequent encumbrances.

Order follows this Memorandum Opinion.
