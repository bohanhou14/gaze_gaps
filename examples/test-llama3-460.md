The admissibility of the minor's statements to the aunt and the examining physician is crucial to the conviction. In this regard, the court has consistently held that statements made by a child during the course of seeking medical treatment or diagnosis may be admitted as an exception to the general proscription against third-party statements (Fed.R.Evid. 803(4)). The statements must be made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment (Id.).

In this case, the minor's statements to Dr. Reid, an examining physician, were properly admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 803(4). The minor's statements were made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and were reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment (United States v. Renville, 779 F.2d 430, 436 (8th Cir.1985)). The court has also recognized that the reliability of a child's statement is not diminished by the child's age, and that a child's statement may be admitted as evidence even if it is not corroborated by other evidence (United States v. Norman T., 129 F.3d 1099, 1105 (10th Cir.1998), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1031, 118 S.Ct. 1322, 140 L.Ed.2d 485 (1998)).

Additionally, the court has held that the testimony of a child victim, even if it is not in the form of a formal statement, may be admitted as evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 807 (United States v. Tome, 61 F.3d 1446, 1449-51 (10th Cir.1995)). The court must consider factors such as the child's lack of motive to fabricate and whether the statements are the type that one would expect a child to fabricate (Wright, 497 U.S. at 822, 110 S.Ct. 3139). In this case, the minor's statements to the aunt and Dr. Reid were spontaneous and lacked any motive to fabricate, and they were the type of statements that a child would make in the circumstances (United States v. Joseph, 27 V.I. 389, 964 F.2d
