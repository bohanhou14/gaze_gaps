In this case, the court ordered the defendants to pay $200,000 in restitution to the child victim. The government appeals, arguing that the district court erred in setting the amount of restitution, and the defendants cross-appeal, arguing that the amount is too high.

The government argues that the district court's calculation of the loss is based on speculative evidence and that the court did not provide a clear error in its calculation. The court in United States v. Erhart, 415 F.3d 965, 970 (8th Cir.2005) held that a loss calculation is reviewed for clear error.

The defendants argue that the court did not provide sufficient evidence to support the $200,000 award and that the award is based on pure speculation. The court in United States v. Vanhorn, 344 F.3d 729, 731 (8th Cir.2003) held that the amount of restitution is governed by the amount of loss suffered by the victim of the crime.

In Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 413, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990), the court held that restitution may only be awarded for the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of the conviction.

The court in United States v. Oslund, 453 F.3d 1048, 1062 (8th Cir.2006) held that the burden is on the government to prove the amount of restitution based on a preponderance of the evidence.

The court in United States v. Young, 272 F.3d 1052, 1056 (8th Cir.2001) held that the amount of loss need only be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.

The court in United States v. Akbani, 151 F.3d 774, 780 (8th Cir.1998) held that according to the Victim and Witness Protection Act, the court may not award restitution for expenses that are not reasonably necessary to the victim's recovery.

The court in United States v. DeRosier, 501 F.3d 888, 892 (8th Cir.2007) held that the court may not award restitution for damages that are not reasonably necessary to the victim's recovery.
