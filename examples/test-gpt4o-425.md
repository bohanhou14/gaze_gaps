Moreover, the argument that Raper was required to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing a § 1983 action is misplaced. As highlighted in case law, exhaustion of administrative remedies is not a rigid requirement in § 1983 actions. In Dunham v. Crosby, 435 F.2d 1177 (1st Cir. 1970), the court emphasized that the exhaustion requirement should not be applied woodenly, particularly when the available administrative procedures would not address the specific due process concerns raised. Similarly, in the present case, the available administrative avenues would not have adequately addressed Raper's procedural due process claims regarding the Registrar’s failure to provide reasons for denial.

Additionally, the adage from Eisen v. Eastman, 421 F.2d 560 (2d Cir. 1969), underscores that inflexibility in exhaustion requirements could unduly bar legitimate constitutional claims. This aligns with the perspective in reference case 435 F.2d 1182, which discusses the burden of proving the correctness of decisions in administrative contexts, further supporting the view that procedural adequacies are paramount before requiring exhaustion.

Furthermore, on the question of whether Massachusetts should decentralize Board hearings, reference case 426 F.2d 1154 underscores that matters of administrative procedure and comity usually allow state boards considerable latitude to determine logistical arrangements. Therefore, compelling the Board to hold hearings outside Boston without solid constitutional grounds overshoots procedural due process requirements and diverges from established judicial deference to local administrative practices.

In conclusion, consistent with the reasoning in 435 F.2d 1177 and 435 F.2d 1182, the plaintiff has properly stated a claim for deprivation of procedural due process. Thus, remanding the case for proceedings not inconsistent with these principles is warranted.

gold_text: We concede that several of our own recent opinions in the area of school administration, read broadly, would seem out of step with these authorities. Beattie v. Roberts, 436 F. 2d 747, 748-749 (1st Cir. 1971) ; Drown v. Portsmouth School Dist., 435 F.2d 1182, 1186 n. 10 (1st Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 972, 91 S.Ct. 1659, 29 L.Ed.2d 137 (1971) ; Dunham v. Crosby, 435 F.2d 1177, 1180 n. 2 (1st Cir. 1970). To the extent that they indicate a general or automatic requirement of administrative exhaustion in § 1983 cases, we note our disapproval and signal our acceptance of the earlier cited line of cases. But we adhere to our view of the necessity for ripeness to the extent that there must be at least some definitive administrative or institutional determination before a § 1983 action may arise. We subscribe to the view expressed in Stevenson v. Board of Education, 426 F.2d 1154, 1157 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 957, 91 S.Ct. 355, 27 L.Ed.2d 265 (1970), that we should not “intervene in school personnel and management problems without requiring such prior reference to local institutional authority as may be necessary to assure that the action complained of is final within the institution in the sense that it is ripe for adjudication.”
