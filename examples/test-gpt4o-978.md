The crucial issue in this case is whether a valid contract of insurance was effectively formed between Winslow and the appellee. Reference cases lend significant insights. In 117 U.S. 519, it was established that the agent's authority is typically coextensive with the business entrusted to him, but in this case, the application explicitly stated limitations which Winslow is presumed to have read and agreed upon, thus binding him to its terms.

Similarly, 41 F.2d 684 highlights that express and unambiguous provisions within the writing are paramount. Here, the application clearly stated that no policy would be effective without the delivery and receipt of the policy during the insured’s good health and full payment of the premium. No such conditions were met in this instance.

Further, the decision in 73 F.2d 391 underscores that the written instrument governs the contract and cannot be reformed based on claims of extrinsic promises or intents, absent fraud or misrepresentation. The evidence indicates that no policy was delivered, and Winslow passed away before his application was processed, voiding any potential contract.

Therefore, the judgment of the lower court finding no effective insurance contract was appropriately affirmed. The explicit terms of the application, which Winslow had agreed to, govern this case and affirm that no contract was concluded prior to his untimely death.

gold_text: Appellant contends that such a contract resulted from oral conversations between Winslow and Moore prior to the. signing of Winslow’s application, and that such contract became effective on December 14, 1934. This contention must be rejected. Moore had no authority to make any contract for or on behalf of appellee. That Moore had no such authority was clearly and emphatically stated in the application which Winslow signed. The suggestion that Winslow did not read the application cannot be entertained. It was his duty to read it, and he is presumed to have done so. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Fletcher, 117 U.S. 519, 529, 6 S.Ct. 837, 29 L.Ed. 934. He is, therefore, presumed to have known that Moore had no authority to make the contract which appellant now says he did make. If, despite his lack of authority, Moore attempted to make such a contract, appellee was not and is not bound thereby. Bankers’ Reserve Life Co. v. Yelland, 9 Cir., 41 F.2d 684, 686; Braman v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 8 Cir., 73 F.2d 391, 393; Toth v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 123 Cal.App. 185, 192, 11 P.2d 94, 96.
