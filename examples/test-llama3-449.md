 I'd be happy to help you with that. Here is the rest of the case:

<answer>

The Court's decision is guided by the Bankruptcy Code and the legislative history of the 1994 amendments. The Code allows debtors to avoid nonconsensual liens, if those liens impair an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under subsection (b) of this section. In this case, the Kolichs are attempting to avoid Antioch's judicial lien, which impairs their homestead exemption. The legislative history of the 1994 amendments indicates that Congress intended to overrule certain bankruptcy court decisions and provide for a more uniform interpretation of lien avoidance.

The Court finds that the formula in section 522(f)(2)(A) must be applied in a manner that comports with Congress' intent. The formula adds together the judicial liens, the homestead exemption, and prior liens. To the extent that the total is less than the value of the property, the lien does not impair the exemption. To the extent that the total exceeds the value, the lien does impair the exemption, and is avoidable.

Applying this formula to the facts of this case, the Court finds that the fair market value of the Residence is $275,000. The World Savings Bank holds the First Deed of Trust with a balance of $219,018.60. The judgment lien is in the amount of $133,875.00, and Norbank holds a Second Deed of Trust in the amount of $80,000.00. The debtor's interest in the Residence, after deducting the first mortgage, is $55,981.40. Antioch's lien is prior in time to Norbank's Second Deed of Trust.

The Court sustains the Kolichs' motion to avoid Antioch's lien in the amount of $85,893.60. The remaining balance of the lien, $47,981.40, is not avoidable. Antioch will continue to hold a lien in that amount, which is not avoidable.

In conclusion, the Court finds that the judicial lien held by Antioch is avoidable to the extent of $85,893.60, and that the remaining balance of the lien, $47,981.40, is not avoidable. The Court's decision is guided by the Bankruptcy Code and the legislative history of the 1994 amendments.
