The plaintiffs in the case at hand have alleged that the defendants, including the supervisory officials, failed to provide adequate medical treatment, resulting in a violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. The defendants have moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and that they do not have personal involvement in the alleged constitutional deprivations.

The court has held that the exhaustion requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite, and that the defendants have the burden of establishing non-exhaustion. The court has also held that the defendants may be estopped from raising the exhaustion defense if they have failed to raise or preserve it, or if they have acted to inhibit the plaintiff's ability to exhaust his remedies.

In this case, the plaintiffs have alleged that the defendants failed to provide adequate medical treatment, including confiscating prescription medicines, refusing to provide requested medication, and failing to perform needed medical tests. The court has held that these allegations do not state a viable claim under the Eighth Amendment, as they do not show a deliberate indifference to a serious medical need.

The court has also held that the supervisory officials, including Poole, Gregoire, Murphy, and O'Connor, are not personally involved in the alleged constitutional deprivations, as they did not participate directly in the alleged events, nor did they have a culpable state of mind.

In conclusion, the defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted, and the plaintiffs' claims are dismissed. The court has held that the plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, and that the defendants have not violated their Eighth Amendment rights.

Newburgh Enlarged Sch. Dist., 239 F.3d 246, 254 (2d Cir.2001); Gaston v. Coughlin, 249 F.3d 156, 164 (2d Cir.2001). A supervisory official’s personal involvement may be shown by evidence that: (1) the defendant participated directly in the alleged constitutional violation; (2) the defendant, after being informed of the violation through a report or appeal, failed to remedy the wrong; (3) the defendant created a policy or custom under which unconstitutional practices occurred, or allowed the continuance of such a policy or custom; (4) the defendant was grossly negligent in supervising subordinates who committed the wrongful acts; or (5) the defendant exhibited deliberate indifference to others’ rights by failing to act on information indicating that unconstitutional acts were occurring.
