Regarding DYS's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), it is crucial to assess whether the Trustee’s complaint states a viable claim. The standard for reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is well established. The court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accept all factual allegations as true (991 F.2d 1236, at 1039-40). A complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain recovery under some viable legal theory (859 F.2d 434).

Dismissal is warranted only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts consistent with the allegations (467 U.S. 69, 355 U.S. 41). This de novo review ensures factual allegations are treated as accurate and construed in the plaintiff's favor (99 F.3d 194; 41 F.3d 1061).

In evaluating Count VII of the Trustee's complaint, alleging that Lake County and DYS paid monies due to LEI and/or Mssrs. Friedman and Wisniewski after the bankruptcy filing, it is not evident beyond doubt that the Trustee can prove no facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief (416 U.S. 232; 355 U.S. 41).

Therefore, the motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is denied. This aligns with precedents that a complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of their claim (58 F.3d 1101).

A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is a test of the plaintiffs cause of action as stated in the complaint, not a challenge to the plaintiffs factual allegations. Id. Thus this Court must assume that all allegations are true and dismiss the claim “only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations,” i.e., that the legal protections invoked do not provide relief for the conduct alleged. Sistrunk v. City of Strongsville, 99 F.3d 194, 197 (6th Cir.1996) (quoting Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984)); see also Scheuer v.

Tatum, 58 F.3d 1101, 1109-1110 (6th Cir.1995) (citing Allard v. Weitzman (In re DeLorean Motor Co.), 991 F.2d 1236, 1240 (6th Cir.1993)). “In practice, ‘a ... complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.’ ” Allard, 991 F.2d at 1240 (quoting Scheid v. Fanny Farmer Candy Shops, Inc., 859 F.2d 434, 436 (6th Cir.1988)); see also Ana Leon T. v. Federal Reserve Bank, 823 F.2d 928, 930 (6th Cir.)
