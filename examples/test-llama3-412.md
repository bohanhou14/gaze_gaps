In the context of bankruptcy law, the concept of embezzlement is crucial in determining the dischargeability of debts. Embezzlement is the fraudulent appropriation of property by a person to whom such property has been entrusted, or into whose hands it has lawfully come (160 U.S. 268). However, the burden of proof lies with the creditor to demonstrate that the debtors acted with fraudulent intent (46 B.R. 880).

In the case at hand, Transamerica Commercial Finance Corporation (formerly known as “Borg-Warner Acceptance Corporation” or BWAC) is a commercial lending company that provides inventory financing to retail businesses. The debtors, Jack Elvin Littleton, Joel Dean Moore, and Eunice Eileen Moore, were the officers, directors, and shareholders of Jacob’s Appliance and TV, Inc. (Jacob’s). Jacob’s primary business was the service and sale of appliances.

The security agreement between Jacob’s and Transamerica provided for the financing of inventory purchases. However, Jacob’s failed to pay Transamerica the proceeds from the sale of its collateral as required under the security agreement. Transamerica contends that the debtors’ failure to pay was a willful and malicious injury under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6) and an embezzlement under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4).

The bankruptcy court and the BAP disagreed with Transamerica’s arguments, holding that the debtors’ conduct was not malicious and did not constitute an embezzlement. The court found that the debtors’ actions were intentional, but not targeted at Transamerica, and that the debtors had a sincere intention to keep the business going.

In conclusion, the debtors’ conduct was not malicious and did not constitute an embezzlement. The court’s decision was based on the fact that the debtors’ actions were intentional, but not targeted at Transamerica, and that the debtors had a sincere intention to keep the business going. The reference cases, 160 U.S. 268, 70 B.R. 155, and 46 B.R. 880, support the court’s decision and provide guidance on the concept of embezzlement in the context of bankruptcy law.

gold_text: Under federal law, embezzlement in the context of nondischargeability has often been defined as “the fraudulent appropriation of property by a person to whom such property has been entrusted or into whose hands it has lawfully come.” Moore v. United States, 160 U.S. 268, 269 (1885). Embezzlement, thus, requires three elements: “(1) property rightfully in the possession of a nonowner; (2) nonowner’s appropriation of the property to a use other than which [it] was entrusted; and (3) circumstances indicating fraud.” In re Hoffman, 70 B.R. 155, 162 (Bankr.W.D.Ark. 1986); In re Schultz, 46 B.R. 880, 889 (Bankr.D.Nev.1985).
