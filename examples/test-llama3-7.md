The case at hand involves a receiver's attempt to enforce the personal liability of stockholders in a insolvent corporation. The receiver brought a bill in equity against the stockholders, seeking to establish the amount due on their unpaid stock subscriptions and to require each stockholder to pay a proportional part of the unpaid balance. The court dismissed the bill, citing the decision in Carey v. McMillan (C. C. A.) 289 F. 380, which held that the receiver's suit was premature and that the stockholders should be required to bring separate actions at law to enforce their claims.

In considering the present suit, the court noted that there were significant differences between the allegations in the bill and those in the McMillan suit. For example, the present bill omitted allegations about the notes given by stock subscribers to the corporation, and it did not state the amount of uncollectable notes or uncollectable stock subscriptions. The court also noted that the present bill did not explain the differences in the statements of facts in the two bills.

Despite these differences, the court held that the decision in the McMillan suit controlled the present case. The court found that the receiver's suit was premature and that the stockholders should be required to bring separate actions at law to enforce their claims. The court also noted that the stockholders were not necessary formal parties to the receivership suit, and that they were represented by the corporation itself.

In reaching its decision, the court relied on several precedents, including Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498, 19 L. Ed. 476, which held that the liability of stockholders is several and not joint, and that the limit of their liability is the par value of the stock held by each one. The court also cited Hall v. U. S. Ins. Co., 5 Gill, 484, which held that a receiver appointed by the comptroller of the currency has the power to institute proceedings against the stockholders of an insolvent bank.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the present case is consistent with the decision in Carey v. McMillan, and it is also supported by the precedents cited above. The court's holding that the receiver's suit is premature and that the stockholders should be required to bring separate actions at law to enforce their claims is reasonable and consistent with the principles of equity and fairness.
