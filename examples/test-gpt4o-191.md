The determination of the fair market value of properties in exchange for other considerations was discussed in several precedents. In reference case 42 F.2d 186, it was held that an agreement involving an annuity in exchange for property is considered a sale, and the property’s agreed value can be upheld. Furthermore, valuation flexibility is highlighted in cases involving specialized assets. In 114 F.2d 958, the valuation of real estate transferred for an annuity considered both the agreed valuation and the annuitant’s financial benefit from the property.

In this case, the petitioners and respondent had differing views. The petitioners argued for a higher property valuation based on their agreed terms while the respondent relied on more conservative third-party appraisals. In reference case 13 T.C. 816, handling similar disagreements on stock valuations, the court supported the taxpayer's basis over the Commissioner's. It emphasized particular transactions' economic realities — a useful parallel to our consideration.

Additionally, the distinction between fair market value and gift considerations in 186 F.2d 962 underscores our analysis. Here, the agreed prices between Mr. Schultz and 212 Corp. were under scrutiny, factoring possible non-arm's-length benefits and familial ties. Thus, the tax implications hinge on accurately discerning between taxable sales and non-taxable gifts.

Consequently, the valuation of $169,603.56 as determined by the Commissioner for the annuity is compelling, aligning with established court principles when no contrary evidence proves a different fair market value by the petitioners.

gold_text: The petitioners argue that the parties agreed upon a value of $225,000 for the properties and that this Court is bound to respect the value contractually agreed upon by the parties and fixed by them as the selling price of the properties. Commissioner v. Patino, 186 F.2d 962, 967 (4th Cir. 1950), affg. 13 T.C. 816 (1949); Evans v. Rothensies, 114 F.2d 958, 962 (3d Cir. 1940); Commissioner v. John C. Moore Corp., 42 F.2d 186,188 (2d Cir. 1930), affg. 15 B.T.A. 1140 (1929). However, this principle is applicable only if the parties are dealing at arm’s length, and there is no reason to question the bona fides of the transaction or the value fixed by the parties. Commissioner v. Patino, supra at 967.
