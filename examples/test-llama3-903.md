I am reviewing the case briefs provided, specifically referencing case 523 U.S. 213 and 118 S.Ct. 1212. Based on the analysis, I find that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is applicable in this case. The Court in In re Cohen, 185 B.R. 171 (1994), held that the finding of fraud by the Circuit Court renders the debt nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. ยง 523(a)(2)(A).

In the present case, the Circuit Court found Henry Suris committed actual fraud, which is essential to the judgment. The Court also made specific factual findings in its Order granting the motion for summary judgment. Therefore, I conclude that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is applicable, and the issue of fraud was actually litigated.

Regarding Terry Suris, the Court denied the motion for summary judgment, as there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether fraud can be imputed to her. The Eighth Circuit has held that a wife's fraud can be imputed to her husband if her husband either knew or should have known of the wife's fraud, or was recklessly indifferent to such fraud. Since the Circuit Court made no factual determination on this issue, I deny the motion for summary judgment as to Terry Suris.

Based on the above analysis, I grant the motion for summary judgment as to Henry Suris and deny the motion as to Terry Suris.
