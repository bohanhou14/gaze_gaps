In reviewing the Commissioner's decision, we must apply the standard of review and consider the entire record, including the evidence that detracts from the weight of the evidence. As stated in Wilson v. Sullivan, 886 F.2d 172, 175 (8th Cir.1989), the substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.

The Commissioner's decision is not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. The medical evidence cited by the ALJ is dated after the July 17, 1992 date, and fails to reveal any discrete improvement in Burress's condition. In fact, the medical evidence continues to describe Burress as "very symptomatic" despite the assistance of the pacemaker.

As stated in Polaski v. Heckler, 739 F.2d 1320, 1322 (8th Cir.1984), when an ALJ rejects a claimant's complaints of pain, he or she must make an express credibility determination detailing reasons for discrediting the testimony, must set forth the inconsistencies, and must discuss the Polaski factors. In this case, the ALJ failed to adequately detail the inconsistencies that he relied upon to disbelieve Burress's testimony.

Furthermore, the Commissioner's reliance on the absence of full-blown syncope episodes is misplaced. As stated in Cline v. Chater, 939 F.2d 565, 568 (8th Cir.1991), the absence of an objective medical basis which supports the degree of severity of subjective complaints alleged is just one factor to be considered in evaluating the credibility of the testimony and complaints.

In conclusion, we reverse and remand for determination of benefits. The Commissioner's decision is not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole, and the ALJ failed to adequately evaluate Burress's testimony and complaints. The medical evidence continues to describe Burress as "very symptomatic" despite the assistance of the pacemaker, and the Commissioner's reliance on the absence of full-blown syncope episodes is misplaced.

gold_text: In addition to the medical evidence, the ALJ also considered, and largely discredited, Burress’s testimony regarding her subjective limitations. Applying the considerations set forth in Polaski v. Heckler, 739 F.2d 1320, 1322 (8th Cir.1984), cert. granted and judgment vacated on other grounds by Bowen v. Polaski, 476 U.S. 1167, 106 S.Ct. 2885, 90 L.Ed.2d 974 (1986), the ALJ determined that Burress’s limitations were less severe than she claimed. Although an ALJ may reject aclaimant’s subjective allegations of pain and limitation, in doing so the ALJ “must make an express credibility determination detailing the reasons for discrediting the testimony, must set forth the inconsistencies, and must discuss the Polaski factors.” Kelley v. Callahan, 133 F.3d 583, 588 (8th Cir.1998).
