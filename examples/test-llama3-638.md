gold_text: NIC is bound by the confirmed plan. Under section 1327(a), “[t]he provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan, and whether or not such creditor has objected to, accepted, or has rejected the plan.” 11 U.S.C. § 1327(a). It is therefore well-established “that a party with adequate notice of a bankruptcy proceeding cannot ordinarily attack a confirmed plan.” In re Harvey, 213 F.3d 318, 321 (7th Cir.2000); see also Adair v. Sherman, 230 F.3d 890, 894 (7th Cir.2000) (stating that “once a bankruptcy plan is confirmed, its terms are not subject to collateral attack”); In re Chappell, 984 F.2d 775, 782 (7th Cir.1993); In re Pence, 905 F.2d 1107, 1109-10 (7th Cir.1990).
