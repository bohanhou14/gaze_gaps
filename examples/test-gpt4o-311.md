KEARNEY, District Judge

The AOPC asserts quasi-judicial immunity as a defense, arguing that it is protected from liability in much the same way as judges are. However, quasi-judicial immunity extends only to individuals performing functions closely associated with the judicial process. In the case of Armstrong v. Squadrito, 152 F.3d 564 (7th Cir. 1998), it was established that quasi-judicial immunity protects individuals and not governmental entities (455 F.3d 772).

Our Court of Appeals has also consistently held that entities are not entitled to quasi-judicial immunity, as highlighted in Lonzetta Trucking & Excavating Co. v. Schan, 144 Fed.Appx. 206, 210-211 (3d Cir. 2005). This distinction ensures that the doctrine protects personal finances of public officials rather than shielding governmental units from liability (502 F.3d 775). The AOPC, as an entity, cannot claim quasi-judicial immunity. Furthermore, immunity does not extend to official-capacity claims as established in Davis v. Hall, 375 F.3d 703, 710 n. 3 (8th Cir. 2004).

Therefore, the AOPC's claim for quasi-judicial immunity fails. Mr. Geness's allegations focus on the systemic failures in ADA compliance, and these administrative failures do not align with judicial decision-making functions protected by immunity. Discovery will reveal the extent of AOPC’s liability for these administrative oversights.

Accordingly, we deny AOPC's motion to dismiss based on quasi-judicial immunity and find that Mr. Geness’s claims against the AOPC are timely. The case shall proceed to discovery to determine the factual basis of administrative failures and potential liability under the ADA.
