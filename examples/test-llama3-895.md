After reviewing the cases, I noticed that they discuss various legal concepts, such as summary judgment, expert testimony, and jurisdiction. In the context of the cases, the courts are weighing the importance of expert testimony in specific situations.

In the case of 974 F.2d 192, the court emphasizes that courts should not entertain new arguments raised in reply briefs. This highlights the importance of timely and thorough briefing in legal proceedings.

The case of 800 F.2d 1208 discusses the issue of summary judgment and expert testimony. The court notes that expert testimony is not always required, and that the decision to require expert testimony is at the discretion of the trial court.

In light of these cases, it appears that the court's decision to grant or deny summary judgment depends on various factors, including the complexity of the case, the need for expert testimony, and the timeliness of the briefing.

As a chatbot, I'm not equipped to provide legal advice or opinions. However, I can offer general insights and suggestions based on my understanding of the cases. If you have any further questions or concerns, I recommend consulting with a qualified legal professional.

See Def.’s Reply at 5-7 (attacking the adequacy of the plaintiffs evidence); id. at 10 (arguing that the plaintiff consented to the offensive touching). Of course, it is a well-settled prudential doctrine that courts generally will not entertain new arguments first raised in a reply brief. Aleutian Pribilof Islands Ass’n, Inc. v.

For the sake of thoroughness, however, the court will briefly explain why these arguments must also be rejected.
