In the context of legal cases, it is crucial to determine whether the defendant's challenges to the government's proffer are effective. As stated in reference case 818 F.2d 1052, the district court must ensure that the defendant has an opportunity to rebut allegations likely to affect the sentence. Furthermore, it is essential to define a standard of proof for disputed allegations, as emphasized in reference case 417 F.3d 305.

In this specific case, Santiago challenges the district court's application of a two-level increase in his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1) for possession of a firearm in connection with the charged conspiracy. He argues that the district court did not specify the factual basis for the enhancement and that the facts proffered by the government were insufficient to establish a nexus between his gun possession and the charged conspiracy. However, we identify no error in the application of the § 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement, as the district court explicitly adopted the factual findings set forth in the presentence report and the government's letter of January 18, 2008.

Santiago also challenges the district court's application of a three-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(b) for acting as a manager or supervisor of the charged conspiracy. He argues that the factual recitations in the presentence report are insufficient to support the enhancement. However, we are not persuaded, as the evidence demonstrates that Santiago exercised some degree of control over others involved in the commission of the offense or played a significant role in the decision to recruit or supervise lower-level participants.

In addition, Santiago contends that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he withdrew his earlier request for a Fatico hearing and sent a letter to the district court regarding the U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1 enhancement that discussed only the law governing convictions pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). However, we do not find that counsel's performance was objectively unreasonable, and therefore, Santiago's ineffective assistance claim is without merit.

In conclusion, we affirm the district court's sentence and reject Santiago's challenges to the government's proffer. The district court provided a full opportunity for Santiago to rebut the government's allegations, and the government's proffer was sufficient to support the sentence. Furthermore, Santiago's counsel's performance was not objectively unreasonable, and therefore

gold_text: First, a defendant’s counsel may properly decide to forego a Fatico hearing as a “matter of strategy,” United States v. Lee, 818 F.2d 1052, 1056 (2d Cir.1987), and we presume that such a strategy is sound absent a strong showing to the contrary, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Here, as the district court noted at sentencing, it was indeed “wise[]” for Santiago to avoid a Fatico hearing at which his prior violent conduct would have been reviewed in detail for the benefit of the district court. Sentencing Tr. at 12. See generally Greiner v. Wells, 417 F.3d 305, 319 (2d Cir.2005) (“We will not normally fault counsel for foregoing a potentially fruitful course of conduct if that choice also entails a significant potential downside.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, Santiago gives no indication that a Fatico hearing would have resulted in favorable factual findings. He asserts only that his counsel had “nothing to lose by holding the government to its burden of proof.” Appellant’s Br. at 32. The Supreme Court, however, has recently rejected the application of a “nothing to lose” standard in this context. Knowles v. Mirzayance, — U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1419, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009).
