FirstMerit also challenges Defendants' standing to bring a § 1981 claim. It is well-settled that § 1981 “prohibits race discrimination in the making and enforcing of contracts,” encompassing all phases of the contractual relationship (Smiley v. Columbia College Chicago, 714 F.3d 998, 1002 (7th Cir.2013)). Courts have emphasized that to demonstrate standing under § 1981, plaintiffs must exhibit a direct, personalized injury-in-fact stemming from the alleged discriminatory practice.

In comparison, 763 F.3d 723 held that, under RICO, only parties directly harmed by the defendant's conduct have standing to recover. Similarly, 750 F.3d 659 noted that a pecuniary interest is essential to show standing. Here, the injury alleged—FirstMerit’s discriminatory refusal to finalize a settlement due to Salgado’s race—confers standing. Defendants allege they were deprived of the opportunity to resolve their debt obligations favorably, as direct parties to the discriminatory act, thereby satisfying the injury-in-fact requirement.

Rulings in both reference cases support Defendants' standing argument. They must show a direct connection between the injury suffered and the discriminatory action taken by FirstMerit, which they adequately plead by linking FirstMerit's refusal to finalize the settlement directly to racial bias against Salgado.

Accordingly, FirstMerit’s motion to dismiss for lack of standing regarding the § 1981 claim is unfounded at this stage. Defendants have sufficiently pleaded their claim and established standing based on direct harm experienced from the alleged discriminatory conduct.

gold_text: FirstMerit contends that Cortland' Properties, Robert, and Maria have no “standing” under § 1981 because they themselves were not the target of racial discrimination. Doc. 45 at 6-7. (Scare quotes are placed around “standing” because, as explained in Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., — U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1377, 188 L.Ed.2d 392 (2014), whether a particular statute allows a particular plaintiff to seek redress thereunder is a matter of statutory interpretation, not standing. See Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Johnston, 763 F.3d 723, 733-34 (7th Cir.2014); In re C.P. Hall Co., 750 F.3d 659, 660-61 (7th Cir.2014).) In response, Defendants say absolutely nothing; they argue only that Salgado has “standing” under § 1981. Doc. 53 at 7-8. Defendants thus have forfeited any argument they might have had to support the ability of Cortland Properties, Robert, and Maria to pursue the § 1981 claim. See G & S Holdings, 697 F.3d at 538.
