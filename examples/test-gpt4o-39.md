The reference cases provide further support for the Bank’s objection to the Debtor’s discharge under § 727(a)(4)(A). In **In re Diodati, 9 B.R. 804**, the court emphasized that the debtor must make a serious effort to provide honest answers and that a casual attitude toward accuracy equates to knowingly and fraudulently making a false oath. The court denied the debtor’s discharge on these grounds. Similarly, in **In re Adelson, 22 F.2d 282**, the court held that a bankruptcy discharge should be denied if the debtor knowingly and fraudulently makes a false oath respecting a material fact. In Adelson’s case, false statements about stock purchases and salary were considered material, and the discharge was denied.

In the case at bar, Thomas Howard Cook’s failure to disclose the transfer of real estate to Delbert Hammond constitutes a false oath, as defined by these precedents. The Debtor’s omission was neither inadvertent nor a simple mistake; rather, it was a deliberate act meant to mislead the court and creditors. The false oath directly impairs the trustee's duty to verify asset disclosures and fairly distribute the debtor’s estate, meeting the standard for knowing and fraudulent intent as set forth in **9 B.R. 804** and **22 F.2d 282**.

This omission is undoubtedly material. The sum involved, $5,000, is significant and its disclosure could have materially affected the administration of the Debtor’s estate. Thus, the Court concludes that the Debtor's discharge is rightly denied under **11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(4)(A)**, following the examples in **9 B.R. 804** and **22 F.2d 282**.

Therefore, the ORDER is issued denying the discharge of Thomas Howard Cook.
