**Generation:**

In reaching our conclusion, we draw upon the rationale expressed in several other significant cases. For instance, in *United States v. Turkish*, 712 F.2d 826, it was noted that an independent source doctrine could be a substantial burden on state prosecutions. We find no such burden in probation revocation proceedings, reinforcing the non-applicability of the exclusionary rule here.

Additionally, the Fifth Circuit in *United States v. Winsett*, 518 F.2d 51, held that the exclusionary rule does not extend to probation revocation hearings. Similarly, the Sixth Circuit in *United States v. Farmer*, 512 F.2d 160, affirmed the denial of suppression motions on the basis that the purpose of probation is distinct from ordinary criminal proceedings.

Our decision aligns with the reasoning in *United States v. Hill*, 447 F.2d 817, where the deterrence rationale was deemed insufficient to warrant application of the exclusionary rule to probation revocation. Citing *Weeks v. United States*, 232 U.S. 383, the ruleâ€™s primary function remains the deterrence of police misconduct, adequately served in criminal trials but not probation hearings.

Furthermore, as stated in *United States v. Vandemark*, 581 F.2d 711, the exclusionary rule is inapplicable in probation revocation due to its fundamentally different purpose from criminal prosecution. Finally, the overall judicial integrity and practical considerations, as noted by the Seventh Circuit in *United States v. Allen*, 349 F. Supp. 749, support this non-extension.

Based on these precedents and practical considerations, we find no compelling justification to apply the exclusionary rule in the case at bar. The judgment of the district court is therefore

AFFIRMED.
