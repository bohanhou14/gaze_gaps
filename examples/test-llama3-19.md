**Generation:**



The tax case at hand involves the calculation of the "amount deferred" under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for purposes of FICA (hospital insurance) tax. The plan is a nonaccount balance plan, and the employer, United Airlines, calculated the present value of the deferred compensation using a reasonable actuarial assumption and method. The employer, however, became bankrupt, and the employee, Mr. Balestra, received only a portion of the benefits.

The court must determine whether the Treasury's regulation defining the "amount deferred" as the present value of the deferred compensation is reasonable and consistent with the statute. In determining this, the court looks to the Chevron framework, which requires it to first determine whether Congress's intent is clear regarding the precise question at issue. If not, the court must determine whether the agency's interpretation is a reasonable one.

The court finds that there is no clear congressional intent on the question of defining the "amount deferred" and that the Treasury's regulation is reasonable. The regulation is based on a simple and flexible definition of present value, which is consistent with the scant legislative history. The court also notes that the regulation is consistent with the Supreme Court's holding in Cartwright v. United States, 411 U.S. 546 (1973), which concerned the fair market value of mutual fund shares.

The court therefore concludes that the Treasury's regulation is reasonable and consistent with the statute, and it affirms the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the government. The court's decision is in line with the holdings in Reference cases 764 F.2d 322 and 752 F.2d 518, which also considered the application of Treasury regulations in the context of tax law.

gold_text: A similar point can be made with respect to McDonald v. Commissioner, 764 F.2d 322 (5th Cir.1985) and Estate of Gresham v. Commissioner, 752 F.2d 518 (10th Cir.1985). The Balestras rely on both cases, but these out-of-circuit cases are neither binding nor persuasive. Both cases involve the invalidation of a Treasury regulation when the related statute explicitly required consideration of fair market value. The statute in this case never references “fair market value.” Moreover, in this instance, there is no unambiguous intent or purpose requiring such a valuation.
