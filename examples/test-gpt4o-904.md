In making our determinations, we draw upon past cases that elucidate principles applicable to this matter. For instance, in GB Marketing USA Inc. v. Gerolsteiner Brunnen GmbH & Co., the district court invalidated a copyright for failing to disclose preexisting components in the copyright application, identifying a precedent where non-disclosure compromises the validity of a copyright (345 F.3d 1140, citing 782 F.Supp. at 774-75). Similarly, DT argues that its contribution to the PlumbBob USB design introduces artistic elements distinguishable from EA's preexisting work, a critical factor acknowledged in decisions such as Wildlife Express Corp. v. Carol Wright Sales, Inc., which explored the bounds of derivative works (207 F.3d 402, citing 18 F.3d 502, 508).

Regarding functional versus non-functional contributions, the case law highlights that courts consider the intent and execution of design features. Specifically, the functionality of design elements was critically examined in cases like Entm’t Research Grp., Inc. v. Genesis Creative Grp., Inc., where non-functional artistic differences were upheld for originality (122 F.3d at 1221-22).

Consequently, these precedents support our conclusion that there are material facts in dispute meriting jury evaluation on both the originality and functional aspects of DT's design, and thus, the district court's summary judgment on the copyright claim is reversed.

Seattle Lighting Fixture Co., 345 F.3d 1140, 1146-47 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that additions designed to turn a ceiling lamp into a table lamp were functional), and Pickett v. Prince, 207 F.3d 402, 405 (7th Cir. 2000) (Posner, C.J.) (stating that the differences between a guitar based on Prince's symbol and Prince’s symbol may be "nothing more than the functional difference between a two-dimensional symbol and a guitar in the shape of that symbol,” but also positing that perhaps “the juxtaposition of the symbol and the guitar is enough to confer on the ensemble sufficient originality” for copyright protection).
