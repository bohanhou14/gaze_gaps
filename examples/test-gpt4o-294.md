It is noteworthy that the sufficiency of evidence often depends on specific jurisprudence standards. Reference case 359 U.S. 437 highlights that the jury must be allowed to consider all possibilities unless there is overwhelming improbability, suggesting that even tenuous evidence, as in the accident’s circumstances here, might be sufficient for jury consideration.

Likewise, in 377 U.S. 152, the Supreme Court emphasized that the sufficiency under state or federal standards should not unduly disturb the jury’s verdict unless clearly erroneous. This aligns with our current scenario where the jury had a basis, however minimal, for their finding of negligence.

Moreover, 281 F.2d 766 acknowledged that state law usually governs on substantive matters, which implies New York's conflict laws would look to North Carolina law here. The principle delineated in Morrissey v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 368 U.S. 378, further reinforces the point that federal courts often apply state evidence sufficiency standards in diversity cases, though this remains a contentious issue as iterated in 315 F.2d 335 and 368 F.2d 713.

Given these citations, it’s evident that while the sufficiency question here is close, improper conduct during summation compounded the weak evidence, necessitating a new trial.

The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
