In this case, we must consider whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizes federal courts to issue injunctions to stay state prosecutions, within the context of 28 U.S.C.A. § 2283. The anti-injunction statute traditionally prohibits federal courts from intervening in state court proceedings except under specific conditions.

The language in § 2283 states: “A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.” Historical precedents, such as 314 U.S. 118 and 244 F.2d 394, underscore a long-standing hesitance to allow federal intervention in state affairs, emphasizing the principle of federal non-interference unless clear congressional authorization exists.

In our analysis, we note that the Civil Rights Act provides explicit provisions under § 204(a) for the issuance of temporary injunctions to protect individuals exercising rights secured by § 201. The Supreme Court has previously established that “non-forcible attempts to gain admittance to or to remain in establishments covered by the Act, are immunized from prosecution” (Hamm v. City of Rock Hill, 379 U.S. 306).

Moreover, it is essential to recognize that despite the prohibitive stance of § 2283, exceptions exist where federal courts seek to protect or effectuate their judgments (275 F.2d 397). Given that § 203(c) of the Civil Rights Act prohibits punishment for exercising accommodation rights, it provides the required express authorization for federal courts to enjoin state proceedings as necessary to avoid irreparable harm.

Thus, §§ 203(c) and 204(a) effectively constitute the necessary congressional authorization under § 2283, allowing federal courts to issue injunctions in cases like the present one to prevent state prosecution of individuals asserting their federally protected civil rights.

gold_text: . Section 2283 is the successor to § 5 of the Act of March 2, 1793, 1 Stat. at L. 335, Chap. 22, which provided that no writ of injunction might be granted on the part of Federal courts to stay proceedings in any state court. This section was later amended to make an exception for proceedings in bankruptcy. 36 Stat. at L. 1162, Chap. 231. The provision, as amended, was carried forward as § 720 of the Revised Statutes (1874), § 265 of the Judicial Code (1911), and as 28 U.S.C.A. § 379 (1940). Section 2283 resulted from the revision of the Judicial Code in 1948. 62 Stat. 968. The history of the section together with the exceptions which had been statutorily or judicially created to it are fully discussed by the Supreme Court in Toucey v. New York Life Insurance Company, 1941, 314 U.S. 118, 62 S.Ct. 139, 86 L.Ed. 100; and Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America v. Richmond Brothers, supra; and in our cases of Jacksonville Blow Pipe Company v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., 5 Cir. 1957, 244 F.2d 394; and T. Smith & Son, Inc. v. Williams, 5 Cir., 1960, 275 F.2d 397.
