The United States Supreme Court has established that a specific protest must be made in writing, detailing the basis and reasons for the protest. In the case of Girard Trust Company v. United States, 270 U. S. 163, 46 S. Ct. 229, 70 L. Ed. 524, the Court held that a protest is for the purpose of inviting attention of the taxing officers to the illegality of the collection, so that they may take remedial measures at once. Similarly, in United States v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 276 U. S. 160, 48 S. Ct. 236, 72 L. Ed. 509, the Court emphasized that a protest must be specific, and not simply an argument or claim.

In the present case, the plaintiff argues that the oral statements made to the collector constitute a specific protest. However, this argument is flawed. The Supreme Court has consistently held that a protest must be in writing, and the oral statements made to the collector do not meet this requirement. Furthermore, the oral statements were not reported to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by the collector.

In addition, the oral statements were not a specific protest, as they did not challenge the legality of the tax. Instead, they were an argument justifying special assessment under section 210 of the Revenue Act of 1917. As noted in Maas & Waldstein Co. v. United States, 283 U. S. 583, 51 S. Ct. 606, 607, 75 L. Ed. 1285, a request for special assessment under section 210 is not a specific protest within the meaning of section 1324 (a).

In conclusion, the oral statements made to the collector do not constitute a specific protest, and the plaintiff is not entitled to interest on the overpayment of taxes. The judgment of the court below must be affirmed. Reversed. <answer>
