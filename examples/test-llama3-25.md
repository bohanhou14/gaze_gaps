In considering whether Pizza Hut and A & M should be considered a single employer for the purpose of Ms. Lockard's Title VII suit, the court may look to factors such as whether the companies have a unified management structure, share employees, and have a common ownership structure. See 650 F.2d 990. In this case, Ms. Lockard points to evidence that the policies and procedures in effect at the Atoka restaurant were those of Pizza Hut, which suggests a level of control and coordination between the two companies.

In contrast, the Second Circuit has held that control over labor relations was established where the evidence demonstrated that the parent ran its wholly owned subsidiary in a direct, hands-on fashion; applications for employment with the subsidiary went through the parent; all personnel status reports were approved by the parent; and the subsidiary cleared all major employment decisions with the parent. See 3 F.3d 1357.

In this case, Ms. Lockard does not present such evidence of direct control and coordination between Pizza Hut and A & M. Therefore, the court may not find that the two companies should be considered a single employer for the purpose of Ms. Lockard's Title VII suit.

Furthermore, even if the court were to consider the two companies as a single employer, Ms. Lockard would still need to demonstrate that she was the victim of discrimination. In 162 F.3d 1062, the court held that to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that she was a member of a protected class, that she was qualified for the position, and that she was subjected to an adverse employment action.

gold_text: It is well-settled that, in the absence of special circumstances, a parent corporation is not liable for the Title VII violations of its wholly owned subsidiary. See Watson v. Gulf & W. Indus., 650 F.2d 990, 993 (9th Cir.1981). See also, Frank v. U.S. West, Inc., 3 F.3d 1357, 1362 (10th Cir.1993) (the "doctrine of limited liability creates a strong presumption that a parent company is not the employer of its subsidiary's employees, and the courts have found otherwise only in extraordinary circumstances.”) Such "exceptional circumstances” exist where the parent corporation exercises a degree of control that exceeds that normally exercised by a parent corporation. See id. at 1363. See also, Lock-ard v. Pizza Hut, Inc., 162 F.3d 1062, 1071 n. 2 (10th Cir.1998).
