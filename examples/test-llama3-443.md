ORDER CONFIRMING CHAPTER 13 PLAN

This matter is before the Court to consider confirmation of a chapter 13 plan filed by debtors Jeffery Richard Kindle and Aislinn Sabrina Kindle (“Debtors”) on July 26, 2017. The plan proposes a separate classification of the student loan creditor, which the Trustee objects to as unfairly discriminating against non-student loan unsecured creditors.

The Court has determined that Debtors' projected disposable income in this case is limited to the amount set forth in their means test. The Court must next determine whether Debtors' separate classification of their student loan creditor unfairly discriminates against Debtors' other unsecured creditors.

The Bankruptcy Code allows for the separate classification of student loan creditors, as provided in 11 U.S.C. § 1322(b)(5). However, the Court must also consider whether the classification is unfair under 11 U.S.C. § 1322(b)(1). In determining whether a separate classification is unfair, the Court will consider the five-factor test established in In re Belton, C/A No. 16-03040-JW, 2016 WL 7011570, at *6 (Bankr. D.S.C. Oct. 13, 2016).

The Court finds that Debtors have a good faith, rational basis for the separate classification of their student loan creditor. The classification is necessary to Debtors' rehabilitation under Chapter 13, as it allows them to continue making payments on their student loans outside of the plan. The separate classification is also reasonable, as it reflects the different treatment provided to student loan creditors under 11 U.S.C. § 1322(b)(5).

The Court further finds that the separate classification does not unfairly discriminate against non-student loan unsecured creditors. The plan proposes to pay all allowed unsecured claims, including non-student loan creditors, a percentage of their claims, which is greater than the percentage they would receive if the student loan creditor was not separately classified.

Therefore, the Court finds that Debtors' separate classification of their student loan creditor is not unfair and does not violate 11 U.S.C. § 1322(b)(1).

Accordingly, the Court hereby confirms Debtors' chapter 13 plan.

Judge Waites also stated that “[hjelpful, but not controlling to this analysis, is evidence indicating whether the proposed distribution is greater than would be received by the. unsecured creditors in a Chapter 7 liquidation, and the degree of difference in distributions between a plan containing separate classifications and one •without.” Id. at *7, n.ll.
