The case at hand presents a situation where a defendant, Rocky Mountain News (RMN), seeks to dismiss the lawsuit due to improper service of process. RMN argues that the summons was not properly served as it was addressed to an individual, Kirk McDonald, who was not an officer or representative of RMN.

However, the court recognizes that technical defects in a summons do not justify dismissal unless a party can demonstrate actual prejudice. As stated in United Food & Commercial Workers Union, Locals 197, et al. v. Alpha Beta Co., 736 F.2d 1371, 1382 (9th Cir.1984), "Rule 4 is a flexible rule that should be liberally construed to uphold service so long as a party receives sufficient notice of the complaint." Moreover, the court notes that RMN has not demonstrated any actual prejudice arising from the defective summons.

Furthermore, the court finds that RMN's conduct warrants the conclusion that the defense of insufficiency of process has been waived. As stated in Trustees of Central Laborers' Welfare Fund v. Lowery, 924 F.2d 731, 732 (7th Cir.1991), "a defendant's failure to assert a defense prior to entry of default judgment when defendant had actual notice of the action constitutes waiver of the defense." In this case, RMN's counsel and Plaintiff's counsel entered into discussions to informally resolve the deficiency in the service of process, and RMN failed to raise any objections until months later.

In conclusion, the court denies RMN's motion to dismiss based on improper service of process. As stated in 39 F.3d 1398, "technical defects in a summons do not justify dismissal unless a party can demonstrate actual prejudice." RMN's failure to demonstrate actual prejudice and its conduct in waiving the defense of insufficiency of process support the court's decision.

gold_text: I also note that the deficiency of process is merely technical. Though C. Smith was not authorized to accept service, knowledge that RMN was to be a defendant in this action was clearly passed on to the appropriate persons at RMN because RMN retained counsel with respect to this complaint. “Rule 4 [providing for service of process] is a flexible rule that should be liberally construed so long as a party receives sufficient notice of the complaint.” United Food & Commercial Workers Union v. Alpha Beta Co., 736 F.2d 1371, 1382 (9th Cir.1984). Additionally, technical defects “do not justify dismissal unless a party is able to demonstrate actual prejudice.” Chan v. Society Expeditions, Inc., 39 F.3d 1398, 1404 (9th Cir.1994). Here, RMN clearly received sufficient notice of the complaint to enable it to take actions necessary to defend itself and it has not demonstrated any prejudice. As such, I deem service of process to have been effective.
