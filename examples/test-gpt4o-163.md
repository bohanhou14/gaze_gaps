In determining whether the class action settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, this Court adheres to the framework established in relevant case law. As per United States v. Miami, 614 F.2d 1322, 1330-31 (5th Cir. 1981), on reh., 664 F.2d 435, before preliminarily approving a consent decree, it must be ensured that the decree results from good faith, arms-length negotiations. Here, the parties engaged extensively in discovery and negotiations, akin to Flinn v. FMC Corp., 528 F.2d 1169, 1173 (2d Cir. 1975).

Once preliminarily approved, a decree is presumptively reasonable as seen in Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 616 F.2d 1006, 1013 (7th Cir. 1980) and United States v. Philadelphia, 499 F.Supp. 1196 (E.D.Pa.1980). The notice provided to class members followed this principle, aligning with Village of Arlington Heights, 616 F.2d at 1014. Additionally, the fairness hearing held satisfies the need for public comments and objections, supporting the procedural fairness highlighted in cases like Dennison v. Los Angeles, 658 F.2d 694, 695-96 (9th Cir. 1981).

Finally, in ensuring that this settlement serves the interests of the class, the Court draws from the rationale in Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 921 (6th Cir.1983) and Enterprise Energy Corp. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., 137 F.R.D. 240, 246 (S.D.Ohio 1991), which emphasize evaluating the settlement as a whole in light of the circumstances, ensuring it meets the standards of fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness.

gold_text: The district court bases its preliminary approval of a proposed settlement upon its familiarity with the issues and evidence of the case as well as the arms-length nature of the negotiations prior to the settlement. In re Dun, 130 F.R.D. at 369. The court should also determine that the settlement is neither illegal nor collusive. Vukovich, 720 F.2d at 921; In re Dun, 130 F.R.D. at 369. With such preliminary approval, the settlement is presumptively reasonable, and an individual who objects has a heavy burden of proving the settlement is unreasonable. Vukovich, 720 F.2d at 921 (citing Stotts v. Memphis Fire Depâ€™t, 679 F.2d 541, 551, (6th Cir.1982), rev. on other grounds, 467 U.S. 561, 104 S.Ct. 2576, 81 L.Ed.2d 483 (1984)); Enterprise Energy Corp., 137 F.R.D. at 246.
