The case at hand is a motion by the defendant for an order in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis to vacate and set aside the judgment of conviction. The defendant claims that his plea of guilty and confession in open court were procured as a result of coercion by his former counsel, and that he entered his plea under a misapprehension as to what it entailed.

In Chandler v. United States, 171 F.2d 921, it was held that a plea of guilty must be made voluntarily and with a full understanding of the consequences. Similarly, in Best v. United States, 184 F.2d 131, it was held that a confession in open court must be made voluntarily and with a full understanding of the consequences.

In this case, the defendant claims that his former counsel coerced him into pleading guilty and confessing in open court. However, the evidence presented shows that the defendant was represented by two capable attorneys who exercised due diligence to ascertain the facts and prepare a legal defense. The defendant's own testimony was vague and indefinite, and the testimony of his former counsel was thorough and detailed.

The court finds that the defendant's contentions are without merit and his motion must be denied. The defendant was adequately represented by his counsel and made a knowing and voluntary plea of guilty and confession in open court.
