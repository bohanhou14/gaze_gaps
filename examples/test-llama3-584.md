Based on the reference cases, it appears that the court is considering the applicability of RICO to a business fraud claim. The court notes that RICO was enacted to control organized crime and provide new remedies for unlawful activities, but questions whether a civil RICO action can be based on garden variety business fraud.

The second circuit in Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 741 F.2d 482 (2d Cir.1984), cert. granted — U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 901, 83 L.Ed.2d 917 (1985), held that a prior criminal conviction is a prerequisite to a civil RICO action. The court also notes that the Eleventh Circuit in Morosani v. First National Bank of Atlanta, 703 F.2d 1220 (11th Cir.1983), applied RICO to conduct falling within the traditional definitions of criminal activity.

However, the court also cites to Shahawy v. Harrison, 755 F.2d 1432 (11th Cir.1985), which held that simply labeling an activity as "racketeering" does not make it into a RICO claim. The court concludes that the allegations in the case do not fall within the realm traditionally considered criminal and therefore, the RICO claim is without merit.

In conclusion, the court finds that the RICO claim is based on garden variety business fraud and not a matter falling within the realm traditionally considered criminal, and therefore, the RICO claim is due to be dismissed. The court relies on the reference cases of Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 741 F.2d 482 (2d Cir.1984), Morosani v. First National Bank of Atlanta, 703 F.2d 1220 (11th Cir.1983), and Shahawy v. Harrison, 755 F.2d 1432 (11th Cir.1985), to support its decision.

gold_text: A further reason why Convey-All’s RICO claim cannot be maintained is that a civil RICO plaintiff must allege something more than injury resulting from the predicate acts. Bankers Trust Co. v. Rhoades, 741 F.2d 511 (2nd Cir.1984); Alexander Grant and Company v. Tiffany Industries, Inc., 742 F.2d 408 (8th Cir.1984). The language of RICO “requires that plaintiffs allege injury caused by an activity which RICO was designed to deter, which, whatever it may be, is different from that caused simply by such predicate acts as are alleged here”. Sedima, 741 F.2d at 949. Although Convey-All does allege in its RICO count that it suffered injuries “by reason of a pattern of unlawful conduct on the part of plaintiff and its aforesaid employees”, it fails to assert how the alleged injury is a product of “racketeering”, distinct from the injury caused by fraud perpetrated by mail or telephone. This may be just another way of saying what has already been said.
