Upon reviewing Petitioner’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, this Court must apply the two-pronged test established by Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). First, Petitioner must show that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Second, Petitioner must demonstrate that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense, resulting in a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. 

In the case at hand, counsel’s decision to not raise all appellate issues requested by Petitioner does not meet the threshold of ineffective assistance. Similar to the rationale in 463 U.S. 745, it is counsel’s duty to strategically select the most meritorious arguments on appeal rather than diluting the appeal with weaker claims. 

Moreover, the magistrate judge’s analysis in case 13 F.3d 528 supports the argument that not all alleged errors must be raised if they do not have a "reasonable probability" of altering the outcome. The arguments omitted here fall into that category. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to deem the appellate counsel’s performance as constitutionally deficient under Strickland.

Therefore, the Petitioner’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim also fails, and his habeas corpus petition is denied in its entirety.

gold_text: In addition to setting the standard for effective representation of trial counsel, Strickland v. Washington sets the standard for effective assistance of appellate counsel. See, e.g., Mayo v. Henderson, 13 F.3d 528, 533 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 820, 115 S.Ct. 81, 130 L.Ed.2d 35 (1994). Such counsel is not required to raise each and every issue and each and every appellate level. Instead, it is reasonable for appellate counsel to focus on stronger arguments. It is not the province of the habeas court to “second guess the reasonable professional judgments of appellate counsel as to the most promising appeal issues.” Avincola v. Stinson, 1999 WL 557965 * 12 (S.D.N.Y.1999); see Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 754, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983). Appellate counsel’s failure to raise certain issues can only amount to ineffective assistance of counsel if “significant and obvious” issues were abandoned while “clearly and significant weaker” issues were pursued. Mayo v. Henderson, 13 F.3d at 533.
