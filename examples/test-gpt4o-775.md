This court has previously held that the "point of novelty" test focuses on those elements of a design which distinguish it from the prior art, rather than considering the overall appearance of the design. See Litton Systems, Inc. v. Whirlpool Corp., 728 F.2d 1423, 1444 (Fed.Cir.1984) (cited in reference case 905 F.2d 375). The district court properly adhered to this principle. Lawman's contention that the combination of non-novel points itself constitutes a novel point is not persuasive; as the reference court stated in Litton, this would undermine the purpose of the "point of novelty" test (905 F.2d 375).

Moreover, the court is not required to make specific findings beyond those necessary to justify its conclusion for summary judgment. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (1986) (cited in reference case 508 U.S. 83). The district court’s analysis provided sufficient reasoning to permit proper review, satisfying the requirement noted in Cunningham v. Laser Golf Corp., 222 F.3d 943, 951 (Fed.Cir.2000).

Thus, considering the prior art disclosures and the principles upheld in case precedents, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment of non-infringement.

gold_text: “The purpose of the ‘points of novelty’ approach ... is to focus on those aspects of a design which render the design different from prior art designs.” Winner Int'l Corp. v. Wolo Mfg. Corp., 905 F.2d 375, 376 (Fed.Cir.1990), overruled in part on other grounds by Cardinal Chem. Co. v. Morton Int'l., 508 U.S. 83, 113 S.Ct. 1967, 124 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). “New” designs frequently involve only relatively small changes in the shape, size, placement, or color of elements of old designs. It is those changes in and departures from the old designs that constitute the “points of novelty” in the patented new design.
