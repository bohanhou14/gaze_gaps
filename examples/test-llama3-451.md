The appeals court has a long-standing requirement that a plaintiff's claims must be pleaded with "factual detail and particularity," not mere conclusionary allegations (Jackson v. Widnall, 99 F.3d 710, 715-16 (5th Cir. 1996)). In this case, Anderson's Second Amended Complaint alleges specific facts that establish a causal connection between defendants' actions and decisions and the alleged constitutional violations (Reference case 724 F.2d 484).

Anderson's First Amendment claims are analyzed under the same Pickering balancing test used to determine the success of the freedom of speech claims (O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of Northlake, 518 U.S. 712, 116 S.Ct. 2353, 135 L.Ed.2d 874 (1996)). The court must balance the interests of the employee, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern against the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees (Pickering v. Board of Educ. of Tp. High School Dist., 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968)).

The district court's dismissal of Anderson's First Amendment claims is reversed because the record is not sufficient to perform a Pickering balancing test. The court's review is de novo, and it will not affirm unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief (Blackburn v. City of Marshall, 42 F.3d 925, 931 (5th Cir. 1995)).

The district court's dismissal of Anderson's due process claims is affirmed. The court held that Anderson did not plead a constitutionally protected property interest in any non-economic benefit and that, because his salary was not reduced when he was reassigned, he had alleged no due process violation (Reference case 51 F.3d 42).

The appeal of sanctions is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The notice of appeal was filed late, and the court has no jurisdiction to consider the appeal (Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A)).

gold_text: Defendants contend that their Motion for Reconsideration extended the time within which they could appeal the April 17, 1998 Order of Remand. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4), the timely filing of certain post-decision motions defers the start of the appeal period until disposition of the motion. The motions that will extend or toll the thirty-day time limit under Rule 4 include: 1) a motion under Civil Rule 50(b) (insufficient evidence for judgment); 2) a motion under Civil Rule 52(b) (to amend judgment or make additional findings of fact); 3) a motion under Civil Rule 60 (for relief from a judgment); 4) a motion for attorney’s fees by the prevailing party under Civil Rule 54; 5) a motion for new trial under Civil Rule 59(a); and 6) a motion to amend or alter judgment under Civil Rule 59. Defendants argue that we should treat their motion for reconsideration as a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend judgment. We cannot. Defendants’ motion for reconsideration sought only to have the monetary sanctions vacated and “such other and further relief to which Defendant may show themselves justly entitled.” Because the question of sanctions raised in defendants’ motion for reconsideration is collateral to the determination of the merits of the motion to remand, it does not amount to a Rule 59(e) motion triggering Rule 4(a)(4). See Campbell v. Bowlin, 724 F.2d 484, 488 (5th Cir.1984) (overruled on other grounds by United States v. Clark, 51 F.3d 42 (5th Cir.1995)). Therefore, the notice of appeal filed 66 days later did not vest this court with jurisdiction to review the sanction order imposed by the February 20, 1998 order of remand. Further, the notice of appeal is limited by its terms to the $2000.00 sanction order contained in the February 20, 1998 order, and so is not effective in appealing the $2000.00 sanction imposed by the April 17, 1998 order. We conclude that we have no jurisdiction to review the propriety of either sanction order and consequently must dismiss the appeal.
