In this case, the court must determine whether a corporate officer who is personally liable for corporate fraud may discharge such debt in bankruptcy. The court holds that the officer is not a fiduciary within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4) and is entitled to summary judgment on the non-dischargeability claims.

The court first considers whether the state court default judgment is collaterally estopped from being relitigated in bankruptcy. The court finds that the notice requirement was not satisfied because the officer was not personally served with summons or have actual knowledge of the existence of the litigation before default judgment was entered. However, the court notes that the officer had actual knowledge of the default judgment during the two-year interval provided by California Code of Civil Procedure § 473.5 and concludes that the officer had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the state court default judgment.

The court then examines whether the state court's determination that the officer breached fiduciary duties as an officer of the corporation is dispositive of whether the officer committed fraud as a § 523(a)(4) fiduciary. The court finds that the officer is not a fiduciary within the meaning of § 523(a)(4) because, under California law, a corporate officer is not a trustee of the corporation's assets. The court relies on the California Supreme Court's holding in Bainbridge v. Stoner, 16 Cal.2d 423, 106 P.2d 423 (1940), that a corporate officer acts in a fiduciary capacity as an agent of the corporation, but is not a trustee with respect to corporate assets.

The court also notes that the bankruptcy court's conclusion in Ragsdale v. Haller, 780 F.2d 794 (9th Cir. 1986), that California partners are fiduciaries within the meaning of § 523(a)(4) is distinguishable from this case because it involved partnership law, not corporate law.

In conclusion, the court holds that the officer is not a fiduciary within the meaning of § 523(a)(4) and is entitled to summary judgment on the non-dischargeability claims.

gold_text: . Indeed, in Roots v. Bangerter (In re Bangerter), 106 B.R. 649, 654 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.1989), the court concluded that "California law does not hold that a majority shareholder is a trustee of the corporate assets or any interests that shareholders may have in the corporate res.” As a result, the court held that a minority shareholder could not maintain a § 523(a)(4) cause of action against a majority shareholder. While In re Bangerter addressed the status of a controlling shareholder, the court recognized that whether an officer is a fiduciary under § 523(a)(4) represented a similar issue and cited approvingly to Alexander & Alexander of Washington, Inc. v. Hultquist (In re Hultquist), 101 B.R. 180 (9th Cir. BAP 1989).
