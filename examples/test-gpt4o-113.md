The imposition of sanctions in this case is consistent with established legal precedent. The court's inherent power to sanction was affirmed in **Reference case 501 U.S. 32**, where it was emphasized that full attorney's fees could be warranted due to the severity of a party's misconduct. The court in that case found that there was a deliberate misuse of the judicial process, which justified the sanction imposed (cf. Thomas v. Capital Security Services, Inc., 836 F. 2d 866 (CA5 1988) (en banc)).

Similarly, in **Reference case 197 F.R.D. 212**, sanctions were deemed necessary due to repeated non-compliance with court orders and a significant delay in the trial date. The court underscored its broad discretion to ensure compliance through sanctions, as codified in local rules and federal procedural rules (L.R.Civ.P. 31(a), L.R.Civ.P. 11(f)).

In this instance, Smith’s failure to submit the pre-trial order timely and his subsequent alteration of Defendant's stipulation without informing the court falls squarely within the scope of sanctionable conduct under Rule 16(f). This failure undermined the court's scheduling and planning processes, mirroring the misconduct observed in the referenced cases. Therefore, sanctioning Smith in the amount of $175 is appropriate and necessary to uphold the integrity and efficiency of judicial proceedings.

NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 2132, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). Based on the foregoing, the court shall sanction Smith $175 for his disregard of the June 1, 2001 scheduling order. See Zak v. Kenney, 197 F.R.D. 212, 214 (D.Conn.2000) (sanctioning counsel for not filing pretrial memo); Martin, supra at 604 (same for not filing status report); Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f).
