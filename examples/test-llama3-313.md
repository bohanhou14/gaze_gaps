The legal cases provided serve as references for legal proceedings and sentencing guidelines. In the case of United States v. Tropiano, 50 F.3d 157, the court conducted a Fatico hearing to determine whether there was enough evidence to support an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines. The court found that Tropiano's drug trafficking activities were evidence of a propensity to commit crimes and justified an upward departure.

In United States v. Franklyn, 157 F.3d 90, the Second Circuit upheld a district court's departure from Category II to Category IV without pausing at Category III. The court noted that "so long as the reasons supporting a departure are fully explained, a mechanistic, step-by-step procedure is not required." This decision supports the idea that a sentencing court can depart from the guidelines in a particular case if the circumstances warrant such a departure.

United States v. Kassar, 47 F.3d 562, involved a defendant who was convicted of multiple counts of fraud and money laundering. The court departed from the guidelines because the defendant's conduct demonstrated a propensity to commit crimes and flouted the law despite being given a benefit. The court's decision highlighted the importance of considering a defendant's criminal history and propensity to commit crimes when determining a sentence.

In United States v. Rhonda Farrah, 175 F.3d 1062, the court affirmed a judgment of conviction and sentence. The court rejected Farrah's arguments that the sentencing court erred in departing upward under Section 4A1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that Farrah had engaged in uncharged conduct and that the departure was justified based on her criminal history and propensity to commit crimes.

In conclusion, these legal cases demonstrate the importance of considering a defendant's criminal history and propensity to commit crimes when determining a sentence. The courts have shown that they will depart from the guidelines in particular cases if the circumstances warrant such a departure, and that they will consider evidence of uncharged conduct when determining a sentence. These cases highlight the need for a thoughtful and fact-specific approach to sentencing.

gold_text: Finally, we hold that the District Court did not err in departing from Criminal History Category I to Category III without mentioning Category II. Although a sentencing court should “pause at each category to consider whether that category adequately reflects the seriousness of the defendant’s record,” United States v. Tropiano, 50 F.3d 157, 162 (2d Cir.1995), we have held that such “a mechanistic, step- by-step procedure is not required” where the district court fully explains the reasons for the departure, United States v. Franklyn, 157 F.3d 90, 100 (2d Cir.1998) (quoting United States v. Kassar, 47 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir.1995)); accord United States v. Bridges, 175 F.3d 1062, 1069 (D.C.Cir. 1999).
