The case discusses the application of the White Slave Traffic Act (57 L. Ed. 528) to a defendant who was found guilty of persuading and inducing a 14-year-old girl to go from Barnesville to McMechen, West Virginia, with the intent to engage in sexual intercourse. The case highlights the importance of the defendant's intent and the lack of evidence showing that the defendant's actions influenced the girl's decision to return home.

In the case, the defendant was found guilty of persuading and inducing the girl to return home, despite the fact that the girl had already made up her mind to return home due to her aunt's request. The court held that the defendant's intent was not the only relevant factor in determining guilt, but rather the effect of the defendant's actions on the girl's decision to return home.

The court also discussed the instruction given to the jury, which stated that the defendant's intent was the gist of the offense. The court held that this instruction was misleading and prejudicial, as it gave the jury the impression that the defendant's intent was the only relevant factor in determining guilt, and that the defendant's actions did not matter.

In conclusion, the case highlights the importance of considering the effect of the defendant's actions on the girl's decision to return home, rather than just focusing on the defendant's intent. The court's decision in this case was based on the White Slave Traffic Act (57 L. Ed. 528) and other relevant legal precedents, including case 58 L. Ed. 728.

gold_text: In further support of this conclusion it may be pointed out that the instruction here considered, as it appears to have been understood and followed by the jury, gives to the statute a scope and meaning which has not been indicated or foreshadowed in any previous decision. We have endeavored to examine with care every reported case under this act, but are unable to find any ruling or intimation which sustains this verdict of conviction. In all those cases there was not only clear evidence of persuasion and enticement, but in every instance the destination of the person enticed was a place and environment which implied a purpose to engage in immoral practices. Thus, in the Athanasaw Case, 227 U. S. 326, 33 Sup. Ct. 285, 57 L. Ed. 528, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 911, the destination was a low-class theater, where the surroundings and associations were such'as to furnish potent and almost irresistible temptation to a life of dishonor; in the Wilson Case, 232 U. S. 563, 34 Sup. Ct. 347, 58 L. Ed. 728, the destination was a notorious house of ill fame. In the case at bar there is nothing but speculation and conjecture upon which to rest a finding of that persuasion which the act denounces, while the interstate journey was to the girlâ€™s own home, a home of unquestioned respectability, in which she had lived for years and in which she continued to live for nearly or quite a year after-wards, with all the outward appearance of innocence and virtue.
