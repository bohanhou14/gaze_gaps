First Amendment Rights
Gainor alleges that his First Amendment rights were violated when he was arrested while exercising his freedom of speech and religion. Case law, including *Houston v. Hill*, 482 U.S. 451 (1987), establishes that an officer cannot lawfully arrest an individual solely based on their exercise of First Amendment rights. The law was clearly established at the time of Gainor's arrest, indicating that his conduct, carrying a cross and distributing religious leaflets, was protected speech. Furthermore, the summary dismissal of charges against Gainor underscores the lack of lawful basis for the arrest.

Time, Place, and Manner Restriction
The manner in which Gainor expressed his beliefs may be subject to time, place, and manner restrictions, but these must be content-neutral, narrowly tailored, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication (*Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence*, 452 U.S. 640, 650). Rogers’ actions failed to meet these criteria, as there was no clear evidence that Gainor's activities caused a legitimate disruption.

Reversal of Judgment
In cases similar to this, where the petition for certiorari was granted, and the judgment was reversed, as seen in *Hess v. Indiana*, 414 U.S. 105 (1973) (reference case 414 U.S. 14), the Supreme Court has consistently protected the exercise of First Amendment rights against arbitrary arrests. Gainor’s allegations, if proved, would indicate an unlawful infringement of his constitutional rights, thus supporting the district court’s denial of summary judgment for qualified immunity.

Conclusion
The district court's denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds is affirmed due to the clear establishment of First Amendment protections and the existence of material factual disputes. Gainor’s excessive force and First Amendment claims must proceed to trial to resolve these disputed issues.

gold_text: With respect to Gainor’s final claim, the district court found that Gainor’s First Amendment rights were clearly implicated by the facts of this case. We agree. The First Amendment protects the right to convey religious messages in public forums. See Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness, 452 U.S. 640, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981). Not only did the act of carrying a large wooden cross by itself suggest Gainor’s intent to express a religious message, it is undisputed that Gainor explained his religious mission to Rogers. The First Amendment also protects Gainor’s right to verbally challenge the police officers’ actions. See City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 461, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2509, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987) (“The First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers.”); Norwell v. City of Cincinnati, 414 U.S. 14, 94 S.Ct. 187, 38 L.Ed.2d 170 (1973). To the extent Gainor claims he was arrested solely for spreading a religious message in a manner the officers found “bizarre,” or for challenging the officers’ right to demand production of identification, there remains on the merits of this claim genuine issues of material fact.
