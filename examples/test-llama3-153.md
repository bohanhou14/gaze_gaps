In the legal cases, the courts evaluate the reasonableness of a sentence by considering the § 3553(a) factors. United States v. Scott, 426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The district court must explicitly acknowledge that it has considered the factors and provide a clear explanation for the sentence imposed. United States v. Ellisor, 522 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir.2008). 

In the case at hand, the district court explicitly considered the § 3553(a) factors and provided a clear explanation for the sentence imposed. The court found the defendant's offense to be "reprehensible" and considered his criminal history and potential for future criminal activity. The court also considered the defendant's arguments and mitigation evidence, including his age, abusive childhood, anger issues, and drug problem.

The court's evaluation of the § 3553(a) factors was not procedurally flawed, as the court explicitly acknowledged that it had considered the factors and provided a clear explanation for the sentence imposed. United States v. Scott, 426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The court's sentence was also substantively reasonable, as it was within the guidelines range and took into account the defendant's criminal history and potential for future criminal activity.

In conclusion, the district court's evaluation of the § 3553(a) factors and the sentence imposed were procedurally and substantively reasonable. United States v. Ellisor, 522 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir.2008). The court's consideration of the defendant's arguments and mitigation evidence, as well as its evaluation of the § 3553(a) factors, demonstrate that the sentence was tailored to the defendant's particular circumstances. United States v. Scott, 426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).

gold_text: Although the district court could have said more, it said enough on this record. “[W]e have held that a court’s explicit ac knowledgment that it has considered a defendant’s arguments and the § 3553(a) factors is sufficient to demonstrate that it has adequately and properly considered those factors.” United States v. Ellisor, 522 F.3d 1255, 1278 (11th Cir.2008). We have also “squarely h[e]ld that nothing ... requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the § 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the § 3553(a) factors” for a sentence to be procedurally sound. United States v. Scott, 426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, Mr. Gutierrez’s sentence is procedurally reasonable.
