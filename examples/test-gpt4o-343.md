**Generation:**

In assessing the appropriateness of Rule 11 sanctions, we align our reasoning with established precedents. Under Fed. R.App.P. 38, an appeal is deemed frivolous when the outcome is evident or the arguments lack any merit (81 F.3d 257; 996 F.2d 14). The magistrate judge's finding that Roger Edwards' Rule 60(b) motion was frivolous is well supported by this standard.

The case of E.H. Ashley & Co., Inc. v. Wells Fargo Alarm Servs., 907 F.2d 1274, 1280 (1st Cir. 1990) clarifies that even a cursory examination of relevant case law should reveal whether a claim is sustainable. Similarly, the appeal filed by Roger Edwards appears to be “wholly without merit,” as previously discussed (996 F.2d 14).

Roger Edwards failed to present a substantial factual basis for its claims. The affidavits and expert testimony offered were insufficient to substantiate allegations of fraud. More critically, these alleged misrepresentations could not plausibly alter the original judgment, either on its primary claim or Fiddes' counterclaim, aligning with precedents indicating that such arguments are baseless (81 F.3d 257).

Moreover, Roger Edwards' reliance on flawed legal premises, such as extending Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238 (1944), falls under the category of appeals brought to delay and burden the judicial system. This tactic warrants penalties to deter frivolous appeals and protect the integrity of the process (996 F.2d 14).

In conclusion, the sanctions imposed by the magistrate judge are upheld. Roger Edwards' actions demonstrate a clear disregard for judicial efficiency and merit-based argumentation, justifying the Rule 11 sanctions initially imposed.
