Citing Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977), the District Court determined that to state a valid claim for denial of access to the courts, Moua needed to show actual injury, meaning some specific prejudice to his litigation. In 518 U.S. 343, the Supreme Court underscored that inmates must demonstrate actual injury to sustain a Bounds claim. Moua failed to establish how the absence of the jury charge transcript impeded his legal actions or caused him specific harm.

Further, as illustrated in Peterkin v. Jeffes, 855 F.2d 1021, 1026 (3d Cir. 1988), the mere deprivation of legal materials does not constitute a denial of access to the courts unless actual injury can be shown. The district court found that Moua had access to counsel, mitigating his claim of inadequate legal resources per Bounds. As such, his complaint did not demonstrate the required specific prejudice.

In conclusion, pursuant to the precedent set in 518 U.S. 343 and 855 F.2d 1021, Moua's failure to allege actual injury rendered his claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 insufficient. Therefore, the District Court's dismissal of his complaint was appropriate, and the order is affirmed.
