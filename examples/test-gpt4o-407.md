**Generation:**

To establish a § 1983 claim, plaintiff must show the personal involvement of each defendant in the alleged constitutional violations (58 F.3d 865). Personal involvement can be demonstrated by direct participation, failure to remedy a reported violation, creation or continuation of a harmful policy or custom, gross negligence in supervision, or deliberate indifference to inmate rights (239 F.3d 246; 781 F.2d 319).

Plaintiff alleges that Poole, Gregoire, Murphy, and O'Connor were complicit but provides no specific instances of their direct involvement or oversight failures in the alleged deprivations. Defendants can be liable if they directly participated, ignored reported violations, created harmful policies, negligently supervised subordinates, or exhibited deliberate indifference (249 F.3d 156; 239 F.3d 246).

In the absence of concrete facts to show these defendants' direct or indirect involvement, summary judgment is warranted. The supervisory officials’ actions must reach a level of deliberate indifference or direct complicity, which plaintiff has failed to substantiate (239 F.3d 246). Therefore, plaintiffs claims against Poole, Gregoire, Murphy, and O'Connor for lack of personal involvement are dismissed.
