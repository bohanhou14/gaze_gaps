III.

Petitioner argues that equitable tolling should apply to extend the limitations period due to extraordinary circumstances. However, this Court finds that petitioner has not demonstrated that he meets the criteria for equitable tolling. In reference to the standards set forth in Oshiver, equitable tolling may be applied in situations where the defendant actively misled the plaintiff, the plaintiff was prevented from asserting his rights in some extraordinary way, or the plaintiff timely asserted his rights but in the wrong forum (111 F.3d 1116). Petitioner has not shown that such extraordinary circumstances prevented him from timely filing his petition.

Furthermore, the doctrine of equitable tolling presumes the accrual of the cause of action and suspends the statute of limitations only under specific equitable considerations (111 F.3d 1116). Despite petitioner’s assertions, mere difficulty in preparing legal filings does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling, as demonstrated by precedent.

Additionally, 28 U.S.C. § 2263(b)(3)(B) states that the time periods established under § 2244(d) apply unless statutory exceptions explicitly apply (128 F.3d 1283). Petitioner’s claims do not fall within any exceptions that would extend the limitations period.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that equitable tolling is not justified in this case, and petitioner's habeas corpus petition remains untimely.

IV.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS respondent's motion to dismiss the habeas corpus petition as barred by the statute of limitations.

SO ORDERED.

gold_text: Nor may petitioner avoid the application of the statute of limitation under the doctrine of “equitable tolling.” “Equitable tolling stops the running of the statute of limitations in light of established equitable considerations.” New Castle County v. Halliburton NUS Corp., 111 F.3d 1116, 1125 (3d Cir.1997). At least one federal appellate court has concluded that the statute of limitations period set forth in § 2244(d) is subject to equitable tolling. Calderon v. United States District Court for the Central District of California, 128 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (9th Cir.1997). Equitable tolling under the AEDPA should be found, and an extension of time granted, only if “ ‘extraordinary circumstances’ beyond a prisoner’s control make it impossible to file a petition on time.” Moore v. Hawley, 7 F.Supp.2d 901, 904 (E.D.Mich.1998). In the present case, petitioner has not offered any reasons for failing to file his petition for writ of habeas corpus within the one year limitations period. Likewise, petitioner fails to offer any reasons for waiting over six years following the denial of his direct appeal by the Michigan Supreme Court to file his second motion for postconviction relief with the state courts or to seek habeas relief with the federal courts. A habeas petitioner must diligently pursue habeas relief to avail himself of the doctrine of equitable tolling. Craddock v. Mohr, 215 F.3d 1325, 2000 WL 658023, *2 (6th Cir. May 8, 2000). Because petitioner has not adequately explained his failure to diligently pursue post-conviction relief in the state courts or to seek a writ of habeas corpus with this Court, he is not entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period. See Jones v. Gundy, 100 F.Supp.2d 485, 488 (W.D.Mich.2000).
