The United States seeks a declaratory judgment defining the status of three private corporations under management contracts with the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) for purposes of the New Mexico Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax. The government argues that the contractors are agents of the United States and therefore immune from state taxation.

The court has reviewed the contracts and found that they do not establish an agency relationship between the contractors and the government. The court has also considered the factors cited in United States v. Forst, 442 F.Supp. 920 (W.D.Va.1977), aff'd, 569 F.2d 811 (4th Cir. 1978), such as the contractors' use of government property, their payment of employees' salaries, and their procurement of goods and services. However, the court has found that these factors do not indicate an agency relationship.

The court has also considered the advanced funding provided by the government to the contractors, but has found that this funding does not constitute an agency relationship. The court has noted that the government's advanced funding is simply a means of reimbursement and does not imply a principal-agent relationship.

In conclusion, the court has found that the three private corporations are not agents of the United States and are therefore subject to the New Mexico Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax. The court has also granted the United States' request to intervene in any New Mexico administrative tax proceeding involving the contractors.

gold_text: . It has been argued that tax immunity may be conferred only by the legislative branch. See L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 399^101 (1978). This deference to Congress is amply supported by language in leading cases. See, e. g., United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S. 39, 51, 84 S.Ct. 1518, 1525, 12 L.Ed.2d 713 (1964); City of Detroit v. Murray Corp., 355 U.S. 489, 495, 78 S.Ct. 458, 461, 2 L.Ed.2d 441 (1958). We agree that Congress is best able to adjust tax burdens, but we cannot ignore the power given to executive agencies to create relationships through contract. Although we are skeptical of cosmetic provisions drafted by government functionaries, we must find immunity when these contracts inherently and inexorably draw a private corporation so close to the government as to make it a servant. See United States v. Forst, 442 F.Supp. 920, 924-25 (W.D. Va.1977), affâ€™d, 569 F.2d 811 (4th Cir. 1978).
