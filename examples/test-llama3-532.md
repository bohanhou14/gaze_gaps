Based on the reference cases, it is clear that the issue of whether a debtor must have obtained some benefit from the fraud for a debt to be held nondischargeable under § 523(a)(2)(A) is already settled. In Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U.S. 213, 223, 118 S.Ct. 1212, 140 L.Ed.2d 341 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the "obtained by" language in § 523(a)(2)(A) encompasses any liability arising from money, property, etc., that is fraudulently obtained, including treble damages, attorney's fees, and other relief that may exceed the value obtained by the debtor. This means that a finding of debt due to fraud is all that is necessary to satisfy § 523(a)(2)(A).

In In re Miera, 926 F.2d 745 (9th Cir. 1991), the court held that punitive damages, which are based on the same underlying action justifying nondischargeability of compensatory damages, are likewise nondischargeable. Similarly, in Schoor, 139 B.R. 468, the court held that punitive damages are nondischargeable where actual damages were nondischargeable without looking at specific jury instructions for punitive damages.

In light of these precedents, it is clear that the debt owed to Creditors by Muegler is nondischargeable under § 523(a)(2)(A) and (a)(6) because it was obtained through fraud. The fact that the Missouri jury instructions regarding culpability required a finding that Muegler intended his misrepresentations to harm the Creditors, and that the jury found that Muegler willfully committed fraud, further supports the conclusion that the debt is nondischargeable.

In conclusion, based on the reference cases, it is clear that a finding of debt due to fraud is all that is necessary to satisfy § 523(a)(2)(A), and that punitive damages, which are based on the same underlying action justifying nondischargeability of compensatory damages, are likewise nondischargeable. Therefore, the debt owed to Creditors by Muegler is nondischargeable under § 523(a)(2)(A) and (a)(6) because it was obtained through fraud.

gold_text: When the awards of compensatory damages and punitive damages are based upon the same conduct, the punitive damages award will be nondischargeable under § 523(a)(6) if the compensatory damages award is found to be nondischargeable. In re Adams, 761 F.2d 1422, 1428 (9th Cir.1985). Because the compensatory damages award is nondischargeable and the award of punitive damages was based upon the same finding of guilt, the standard for a finding of fraud under Missouri law and § 523(a)(6) are identical for the purposes of this case. See In re Scarborough, 171 F.3d 638, 644 (8th Cir.1999) (addressing an almost identical situation under Missouri law).
