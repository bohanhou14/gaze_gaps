In considering the case at hand, we must examine the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, as discussed in reference case 159 F.3d 687. This doctrine states that the lower federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over a case if the exercise of jurisdiction over that case would result in the reversal or modification of a state court judgment. Here, the Plaintiff seeks to have the state court judgments declared nondischargeable, which would effectively modify the judgments. Therefore, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine applies, and we must afford the state court judgments the deference they deserve.

Furthermore, we must consider the recent amendments to 11 U.S.C. § 523, as discussed in reference case 290 B.R. 479. These amendments have expanded the scope of nondischargeable debts to include property settlement obligations incurred in connection with a divorce. In this case, the Judgments at issue were part of the divorce decree and separation agreement, and therefore, they are nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(15).

In conclusion, we cannot discharge the Judgments at issue as they are nondischargeable under both the Rooker-Feldman doctrine and 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(15). The Plaintiff's request will be granted, and the Judgments will remain in effect.

gold_text: While the Defendant seeks to characterize the $150 a day amounts awarded under the $861,924.94 Judgment as a penalty and not a support obligation, the Court finds this argument to be irrelevant to the Court’s determination of dis-chargeability under 11 U.S.C. § 523. First, Referee Gibson addressed the Defendant’s argument in his confirmed reports and found that the $150 a day provision in the Divorce Judgment was not a penalty and the Divorce Judgment was never appealed. Thus, it is res judicata and enforceable. In addition, this Court is required to give full faith and credit to the state court Judgments under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. “The Rooker-Feld-man doctrine provides that the lower federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over a case if the exercise of jurisdiction over that case would result in the reversal or modification of a state court judgment. Such jurisdiction is lacking because within the federal system, only the Supreme Court may review a state court judgment.” Hachamovüch v. DeBuono, 159 F.3d 687, 693 (2d Cir.1998). The validity and enforceability of the Judgments are not for this Court to decide. In re Salem, 290 B.R. 479, 482 (S.D.N.Y.2003). The only issue before this Court is not whether the state court Judgments were correctly decided but whether they are dischargeable in whole or in part under 11 U.S.C. §§ 523(a)(5) and/or (a)(15).
