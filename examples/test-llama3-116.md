ORDER
HEMPHILL, District Judge.

In this case, we must determine whether the Secretary’s decision denying plaintiff’s application for disability benefits is supported by substantial evidence. We have reviewed the record and find that the Secretary’s decision is not supported by substantial evidence.

The plaintiff has established a disability due to his chronic bronchitis, asthma, and back injuries. The medical evidence shows that these conditions have been present for many years and have resulted in frequent hospitalizations and periods of disability. The plaintiff’s back injury has resulted in a 50% limitation of motion, and his hand injury has impaired the use of his left index finger. These physical limitations, combined with his age, education, and work experience, make it highly unlikely that he will be able to engage in any substantial gainful employment.

In determining whether a person is disabled, we must consider all of their medical conditions and their cumulative effect on their ability to work. As stated in Underwood v. Ribicoff, 298 F.2d 850 (4th Cir. 1962), “the Referee must give adequate consideration to the possibility of severe orthopedic trouble” and “the tie between these objective findings and the subjective evidence of severe radiating pains in the back and inability to withstand slight exertion because of them.”

The Secretary’s decision is also inconsistent with the principles set forth in Thomas v. Celebrezze, 331 F.2d 541 (4th Cir. 1964), which state that the findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. The Secretary’s decision is not supported by substantial evidence, and we must therefore reverse it.

Finally, we note that the Secretary’s decision is also inconsistent with the holdings of Hanes v. Celebrezze, 337 F.2d 209 (4th Cir. 1964), which state that disability benefits should be denied only if there is substantial evidence that the claimant is capable of engaging in substantial gainful employment.

Based on the foregoing, we reverse the Secretary’s decision and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

gold_text: It might be said that there are other jobs of a light or sedentary nature, or perhaps observational jobs, which plaintiff could perform. The hearing examiner found that plaintiff could perform light to moderate work. There was no showing of what other jobs plaintiff could perform and it seems highly unlikely that other employment opportunities actually exist for someone with plaintiff’s characteristics. This court realizes that employers are reluctant to hire persons who will create insurance problems. They are unlikely to run the risk of increasing their workmen’s compensation insurance costs. An employer would be even more unlikely to hire someone who is uninsurable, as this plaintiff might well be. Sayers v. Gardner, 380 F.2d 940 (6th Cir. 1967); Thomas v. Celebrezze, supra. The courts also are cognizant that employers are concerned with substantial capacity to perform and steady attendance. Thomas v. Celebrezze, supra. The record here clearly demonstrates that plaintiff has recurring attacks of asthma. Chronic absenteeism resulting from plaintiff’s asthmatic condition would certainly affect his employment opportunities. The following language of pertinent application is found in Cooke v. Celebrezze, 365 F.2d 425 (4th Cir. 1966):
