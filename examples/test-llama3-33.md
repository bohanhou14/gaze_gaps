**Generation:**



The cases before us present an interesting question regarding the scope of salvage services and the factors that determine whether a service is considered "low order" or "high order." The reference case 232 F.2d 750 provides guidance on this issue, stating that whether a service is "simple" or "low order" salvage is left to the considered judgment of the judge, as life's variables defy repetition.

In the present case, the district court held that the services rendered by Fort Myers Shell were not in danger, either imminent or reasonably to be apprehended. However, the reference case 181 F.2d 895 suggests that a stranded vessel may be subject to potential danger of damage or destruction, even if not immediately impending. Therefore, we cannot say that as a matter of law peril was not reasonably to be apprehended.

The district court also concluded that Fort Myers was contractually obligated to unbeach the barges, citing a modification and continuation of the prior towing contract. However, the reference case 9 F. 50 states that a shipowner's request for a salvage service and the salvors' response in furnishing it, standing alone, does not create an implied contract. Therefore, we cannot find sufficient evidence to support the district court's conclusion.

In conclusion, the district court's determination that Fort Myers was not entitled to salvage compensation is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial. The issue of the scope of the peril and the factors that determine whether a service is considered "low order" or "high order" salvage must be fully explored and factually supported.
