Given the inconsistencies and contradictions present in the officers' testimonies and their reports, the Government has failed to establish that the officers had a reasonable suspicion to justify the initial stop of Ferguson's vehicle. According to Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, reasonable suspicion must be based on specific and articulable facts, not merely on an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch.

Moreover, the officers' subsequent arrest of Ferguson appears lacking in probable cause. As referenced in 638 F.2d 507, the officers' observations must provide concrete reasons to believe a crime is being committed. Here, the assorted and conflicting accounts related to the tinted windows, the license plate search, and the discovery of drug paraphernalia undermine the credibility of the arrest.

Therefore, considering the totality of the circumstances, including the lack of credible evidence of reasonable suspicion and probable cause, the motion to suppress the gun and other physical evidence is granted.

gold_text: In the end, the police officers’ instincts were correct, as Ferguson, a convicted felon, was indeed in possession of an illegal weapon. But those instincts were based not on any articulable, objective facts suggestive of unlawful conduct, but on, at best, an “inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or ‘hunch’ ” of criminal activity. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). In view of the errors and inconsistencies in the record, I am not persuaded that the officers stopped Ferguson because of excessively tinted windows, I am not persuaded that the windows were illegally tinted (or that they even seemed to be so), and I am not persuaded that the officers saw a metal crack stem in plain view in the center console of the car. Rather, I believe this was nothing other than a random stop. Accordingly, the gun and other physical evidence will be suppressed. See United States v. Vasquez, 638 F.2d 507, 520 (2d Cir.1980) (“[I]nvestigatory stops cannot be made completely at random ... or at the ‘unfettered discretion of officers in the field.’ ”) (citations omitted).
