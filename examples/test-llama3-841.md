In the context of age discrimination in employment, the courts have consistently emphasized the importance of considering the presence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for an employer's decision to terminate an employee. In reference case 846 F.2d 448, the court held that an employer's legitimate reason for terminating an employee, such as a reorganization or cost-cutting measure, can rebut a prima facie case of age discrimination.

In the present case, Montgomery Ward has raised a legitimate reason for terminating Edwin Casbier, which is the elimination of his position as part of a structural reorganization designed to cut costs and increase efficiency. This reason is supported by the evidence, which shows that Casbier's position was eliminated due to the company's financial difficulties, rather than as a result of age discrimination.

Furthermore, the court in reference case 769 F.2d 1215 has emphasized that statistics alone are not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, and that the plaintiff must also show that "but for" his age, he would not have been discharged. In this case, Casbier has failed to provide any evidence that he was treated differently than younger employees who were also terminated as part of the reorganization.

In conclusion, Montgomery Ward has presented a legitimate reason for terminating Edwin Casbier, and Casbier has failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination. Therefore, the court should grant summary judgment in favor of Montgomery Ward.
