In light of these guiding principles, the court turns to the precedent established by key cases. In 431 U.S. 864, the Supreme Court emphasized the congressional intent behind certain military benefits, concluding that regulations conflicting with this intent are invalid. Similarly, the interpretation of the VRB program highlights the necessity for a specific and certain promise at the re-enlistment decision point, which is pertinent to the plaintiffs' claims of breached contractual obligations regarding benefits and information.

Additionally, 650 F.2d 264 provides a salient comparison where a government contract explicitly precluded certain actions, and the plaintiff’s arguments were dismissed based on jurisdictional grounds. The reference to entitlements under specific programs, as observed in United States v. Kania, further demonstrates the court's requirement for a clear statutory or regulatory basis for any contractually promised benefits (650 F.2d 264).

In this context, the plaintiff's reliance on Air Force Regulation 35-35 as part of Beauchamp’s contractual agreement lacks the statutory or regulatory mandate for monetary damage claims. Using the principles in 431 U.S. 864, and the jurisdictional limitations of 650 F.2d 264, the court finds that, despite establishing jurisdiction, the plaintiffs have not presented a sufficiently mandated source for damages under the Tucker Act, thus warranting dismissal.
