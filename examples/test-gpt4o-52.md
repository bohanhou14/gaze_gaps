Langella's assertion that his guilty plea precludes raising his constitutional claims in this federal habeas corpus proceeding is unavailing. According to Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258 (1973), a guilty plea constitutes "a break in the chain of events," thereby preventing defendants from raising independent claims about constitutional violations occurring prior to the plea. The crux of the inquiry post-guilty plea focuses on the voluntariness and competence of counsel's advice. In Perry v. Lynaugh, 417 U.S. 21 (1974), it was reinforced that an effective guilty plea bars subsequent habeas relief on antecedent constitutional claims, aligning with the principle established in Tollett.

Langella's case hinges on the legitimacy of his plea and counsel advice rather than preceding constitutional infirmities. He must demonstrate that his counsel's advice fell outside “the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases” (411 U.S. at 266-67). Without showing incompetence or involuntariness, Langella's guilty plea forecloses his habeas petition on constitutional grounds.

Additionally, Langella argues the Fifth Amendment was violated by the same grand jury indicting him post-testimony. However, in United States v. Camporeale, 515 F.2d 184 (2d Cir. 1975), the court endorsed the practice of the same grand jury issuing a perjury indictment, deeming it in a unique position to assess the witness's credibility. This rationale applies to Langella’s contempt indictment, rendering his claim baseless.

gold_text: . Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 266, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973), holds that a guilty plea precludes a federal habeas corpus claim that the composition of the indicting grand jury violated the fourteenth amendment. Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 30, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 2104, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974), explains that in Toilett the tainted indictment “could have been ‘cured’ through a new indictment by a properly selected grand jury." Here Langella argues that there must be both a new grand jury and redaction of his truthful immunized answers.
