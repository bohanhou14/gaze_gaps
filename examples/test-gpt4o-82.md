Moreover, plaintiffs argue that their case involves a substantial federal question, thus vesting the court with jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. However, as noted in reference case 405 U.S. 538 and 92 S. Ct. 1113, a broad reading of § 1343(3) jurisdiction should not render the amount-in-controversy requirement of § 1331 superfluous. In Eisen v. Eastman, 421 F.2d 560, the court similarly harmonized jurisdictional provisions by requiring a strict interpretation to avoid overlapping jurisdictional grants. Here, despite the alleged constitutional violation, the monetary claims fall short of the $10,000 threshold required under § 1331, making jurisdiction under this statute untenable. 

Furthermore, as outlined in 372 F.2d 817, local boards or administrative bodies exceeding their authority do not extend jurisdictional reach to federal courts absent statutory backing. This supports the conclusion that the District Court lacks jurisdiction over the matter when exclusive avenues of federal jurisdiction, such as the Tucker Act or the APA, do not explicitly apply.

In sum, while plaintiffs present a compelling constitutional argument, the jurisdictional limitations imposed by the relevant statutes and case law, particularly 405 U.S. 538, 92 S. Ct. 1113, and 372 F.2d 817, render this court unable to proceed with the merits of the case.

Selective Service Local Board No. 16, 372 F.2d 817, 826 (2d Cir. 1967), “an unfortunate gap in the statutory jurisdiction of the federal courts . . . .” However, the Supreme Court in Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 547, 92 S. Ct. 1113, 1119, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972), dealt with this very problem stating:
