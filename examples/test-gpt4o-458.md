In determining whether Romero is eligible for relief under the CAT, it is essential to consider the interpretation of "torture" and the concept of "acquiescence" by public officials. According to the CAT, torture includes severe pain or suffering inflicted with the consent or acquiescence of a public official. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1). Importantly, the understanding of acquiescence goes beyond mere knowledge and encompasses "willful blindness" of the officials. In Khouzam v. Ashcroft, it was elucidated that state action in terms of torture requires officials to be aware of or remain willfully blind to acts of torture and subsequently fail to intervene (361 F.3d 161, 171 (2d Cir. 2004)).

Furthermore, it is significant to note that torture by private actors can fall under CAT if government officials have knowledge of such acts and acquiesce. This differentiation is critical as it separates the private actor's intent from the requirement of government intent to inflict torture. According to 502 F.3d 109, specific intent by private actors, viewed in conjunction with the willful blindness or deliberate indifference of government officials, aligns with the definition of torture under the CAT.

Given Romero's credible testimony about the threats and harm inflicted by guerrilla groups and the apparent lack of intervention by Colombian officials, there is a prima facie case for CAT relief. The record suggests Colombian authorities either knew or were willfully blind to the guerrilla groups' activities. Therefore, it is requisite that the BIA reconsider Romero's CAT claim in light of these precedents and definitions, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of government acquiescence to the threats and torture he faced.

gold_text: In Khouzam v. Ashcroft, we interpreted this provision to hold that “torture requires only that government officials know of or remain willfully blind to an act and thereafter breach them legal responsibility to prevent it.” 361 F.3d 161, 171 (2d Cir.2004). We further explained that the acts of private individuals, as Romero alleges, may nevertheless amount to torture if the government of the country where the acts occurred has acquiesced to the acts in violation of its duty to intervene. See Pierre v. Gonzales, 502 F.3d 109, 118 (2d Cir.2007).
