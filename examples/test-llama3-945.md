In the context of the legal cases, the concept of "extraordinary circumstances" is crucial in determining the applicability of Rule 60(b)(6). As mentioned in Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, 69 S.Ct. 384, 93 L.Ed. 266 (1949), this rule provides relief to parties who were confronted with extraordinary circumstances that excused their failure to follow ordinary paths of appeal. In contrast, where parties have made deliberate litigation choices, Rule 60(b)(6) should not provide a second chance.

In the case of Far East, as mentioned in 889 F.2d 242, Far East had no opportunity to follow the normal paths of appeal at the time the judgment was entered. This demonstrates the extraordinary circumstances that justified relief under Rule 60(b)(6).

Similarly, in the case of United States v. Alpine Land & Reservoir Co., 893 F.2d 1201, Alpine Land & Reservoir Company did not participate in the proceedings after 1973 and did not appeal or seek reconsideration of the 1980 judgment until 1991. The district court agreed that Alpine did not know that its reservoir entitlements were in jeopardy before that time. This demonstrates the extraordinary circumstances that justified relief under Rule 60(b)(6).

In conclusion, the concept of "extraordinary circumstances" is crucial in determining the applicability of Rule 60(b)(6). As mentioned in 889 F.2d 242, Klapprott v. United States, and United States v. Alpine Land & Reservoir Co., cases that demonstrate extraordinary circumstances may justify relief under Rule 60(b)(6).

gold_text: Our review of cases in this and other circuits illustrates that the courts of appeal have heeded the Supreme Court’s admonitions regarding Rule 60(b)(6); such relief is available only where extraordinary circumstances prevented a litigant from seeking earlier, more timely relief. Although the timeliness of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion “depends on the facts of each ease,” relief may not be had where “the party seeking reconsideration has ignored normal legal recourses.” In re Pacific Far East Lines, Inc., 889 F.2d 242, 249, 250 (9th Cir.1989) (holding relief appropriate where new legislation undermined the soundness of the judgment). See also United States v. Holtzman, 762 F.2d 720 (9th Cir.1985) (five year delay permissible where litigant reasonably interpreted an injunction to authorize litigant’s conduct and timely relief was sought upon receipt of notice to the contrary); Rivera v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., 921 F.2d 393 (1st Cir.1990) (twenty-three day delay permitted because party not properly notified of pending motion); J.D. Pharmaceutical Distrib., Inc. v. Save-On Drugs & Cosmetics Corp., 893 F.2d 1201, 1207 (11th Cir.1990) (relief from judgment granted because party never served with requests for admissions or motion for summary judgment). These cases demonstrate that Rule 60(b)(6) relief normally will not be granted unless the moving party is able to show both injury and that circumstances beyond its control prevented timely action to protect its interests.
