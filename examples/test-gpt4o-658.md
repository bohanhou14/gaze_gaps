Moreover, the reference cases provide valuable insights. In 102 F.2d 959, it was determined that the court did not retain jurisdiction to entertain a petition after the final decree unless the reservation explicitly included such matters. Similarly, in 125 F.2d 327, it was made clear that the court had not expressly retained jurisdiction over the subject matter of the petition in its final decree, emphasizing that implied or inherent jurisdiction cannot support relief foreign to the approved reorganization plan.

Applying these precedents to the current case, it is evident that the reorganization matters and the final decree were concluded on January 23, 1942. The petition filed by the appellee was not related to any previously litigated matter or errors within the reorganization itself. Thus, following the legal principles outlined in 102 F.2d 959 and 125 F.2d 327, the court lacked jurisdiction to vacate the final decree for a purpose unrelated to the original reorganization. The legislative intent, as provided by Section 207, Subsection h (11 U.S.C.A.), underscores the importance of finality in such decrees. Therefore, the reopening of the decree to permit the exchange of securities must be deemed beyond the court's jurisdiction.

gold_text: In In re Sherland Bldg. Corporation, D. C., 29 F.Supp. 985, the court held, in an attempt by the petitioner to have a final decree vacated and permission granted to exchange his securities, a situation similar to the instant case, that no reservation having been made in the final order, it was a final determination and the jurisdiction of the court ended at that time. To like effect are In re Tom Moore Distillery Co., D. C., 52 F.Supp. 938; In re Corona Radio & Television Corporation, 7 Cir., 102 F.2d 959; In re Wedgewood Hotel Co., 7 Cir., 125 F.2d 327.
