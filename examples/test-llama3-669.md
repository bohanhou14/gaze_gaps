In the present case, the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA) has removed the underlying action to federal court. However, it is unclear whether the GRDA has waived its sovereign immunity. The Supreme Court has held that a state may waive its sovereign immunity by voluntarily invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court, or by making a "clear declaration" that it intends to submit itself to a federal court's jurisdiction (Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 675, 119 S.Ct. 2219, 144 L.Ed.2d 605 (1999)). The GRDA, as an arm of the state, is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court (Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 662-63, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974)).

The case of Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc., 173 F.3d 1241 (10th Cir. 1999), is relevant here. In Sutton, the defendants removed the case to federal court and then litigated the merits of the case. The court held that the defendants' removal of the case and subsequent litigation constituted a waiver of their sovereign immunity (id. at 1170). Similarly, in McLaughlin v. Agricultural Insurance Company, 215 F.3d 1168 (10th Cir. 2000), the court held that the defendants' removal of the case and subsequent litigation constituted a waiver of their sovereign immunity (id. at 1171-72).

In contrast, the GRDA has removed the underlying action to federal court, but it has not litigated the merits of the case. Therefore, it is unclear whether the GRDA has waived its sovereign immunity. The court in Lapides v. Board of Regents, 535 U.S. 613, 624, 122 S.Ct. 1640, 152 L.Ed.2d 806 (2002), held that a state's removal of a case to federal court was not a waiver of its sovereign immunity unless the state "purposefully seeks a federal forum" (id. at 618).

In conclusion, the GRDA has removed the underlying action to federal court, but it has not litigated the merits of the case. Therefore, it

gold_text: A state entity may also waive its sovereign immunity by voluntarily invoking federal court jurisdiction. See McLaughlin v. Bd. of Trustees of State Colls., 215 F.3d 1168, 1170 (10th Cir.2000). Litigating the merits of a claim may serve as a voluntary invocation of federal court jurisdiction sufficient to waive a state entityâ€™s sovereign immunity. See id.; Estes v. Wyo. Dept. of Transp., 302 F.3d 1200, 1205 (10th Cir.2002). Here, the GRDA immediately contested federal court jurisdiction based on its right to Eleventh Amendment immunity. We, therefore, hold that the GRDA has not waived its sovereign immunity in the present case.
