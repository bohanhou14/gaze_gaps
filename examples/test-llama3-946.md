In the context of the present case, the test for infringement is whether the defendant's design, Botticelli, is substantially the same as the plaintiff's design, Grande Baroque, in the eye of an ordinary observer. The court must consider the design as a whole, taking into account the arrangement and proportion of the various elements, as well as the overall effect they produce.

In this regard, the court notes that the defendant's design, Botticelli, is similar to the plaintiff's design, Grande Baroque, in its overall shape and arrangement of ornamental details. However, the court concludes that the defendant's design is not substantially the same as the plaintiff's design, citing the differences in the details of the design, such as the shape and size of the scrolls, the presence of piercings, and the overall effect of the design.

The court also notes that the defendant's design, Botticelli, is not a unique or original design, but rather is a variation of a design that has been in existence for some time. The court cites 95 F.2d 461, which holds that a design is not patentable if it is not novel or nonobvious. In this regard, the court concludes that the defendant's design, Botticelli, is not patentable.

The court also relies on 186 F. 339, which holds that a design is not patentable if it is not a substantial advance over the prior art. In this regard, the court concludes that the defendant's design, Botticelli, is not a substantial advance over the prior art, but rather is a variation of a design that has been in existence for some time.

In conclusion, the court finds that the defendant's design, Botticelli, is not substantially the same as the plaintiff's design, Grande Baroque, and is not patentable. The court also concludes that the defendant's design is not a unique or original design, but rather is a variation of a design that has been in existence for some time. The court's decision is based on its analysis of the design as a whole, as well as the prior art and the test for patentability.

gold_text: The defendant contends that this rule has been modified, at least in this circuit, by such cases as Dixie-Vortex Co. v. Lily-Tulip Cup Corp., 2 Cir., 95 F.2d 461, 467, in which it was said, “that every element of the design is essential,” and Edison Electric Appliance Co. v. Fitzgerald Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 32 F.2d 705, 706, wherein it was said that a patentee “who claims only the design ‘as shown’ is limited to substantially the form disclosed in his drawing.” Such expressions, however, do not need to be interpreted as modifications of the Gorham rule. The substantial identity of the test of. the Edison case was an express part of the Gorham rule. And the Dixie-Vortex pronouncement that “every element * * * is essential” means only that the broad disclosure made by a drawing, without specifications, cannot be limited to a part or “sub-combination” of the entire design. This interpretation of the terse pronouncement is confirmed by the fact that it cited as its authority only Ashley v. Samuel C. Tatum Co., 2 Cir., 186 F. 339, and American Fabrics Co. v. Richmond Lace Works, 2 Cir., 24 F.2d 365, 367. In the Ashley case,’ certainly the Gorham rule was not repudiated: there the court found non-infringement because there was “no likelihood that” the one design “could be mistaken for the other.” [186 F.2d 343.] And the American1 Fabrics case (which, incidentally, furnishes strong support for the validity of the patent here in suit) as a test of infringement expressly adopts the Gorham rule: the court there found it inapplicable, however, becáuse there the accused design was such as to “foreclose all reasonable chance of con-, fusion of mistaking one design for the other” and because there was “no evidence of confusion.”
