To determine whether the order dismissing Kerrville's counterclaims is reviewable under the collateral order doctrine, we must examine whether it satisfies the four requirements outlined by Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).

Firstly, the order must finally dispose of a matter so that the district court's decision may not be characterizable as tentative, informal, or incomplete. In this case, the district court's order dismissing Kerrville's counterclaims is final and complete, and the decision is not subject to further revision or modification. (913 F.2d 205)

Secondly, the question presented must be serious and unsettled. The issue of whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over Kerrville's counterclaims is a serious and unsettled question that has important implications for the parties involved. (638 F.2d 1357)

Thirdly, the order must be separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the principal suit. The order dismissing Kerrville's counterclaims is separable from the merits of the underlying action, and it does not affect the rights asserted in the principal suit. (704 F.2d 144)

Lastly, there should generally be a risk of important and probably irreparable loss if an immediate appeal is not heard. In this case, Kerrville's ability to pursue its counterclaims is at stake, and if an immediate appeal is not heard, Kerrville may be unable to assert its rights in a timely manner. (638 F.2d 1357)

In conclusion, the order dismissing Kerrville's counterclaims meets the requirements of the collateral order doctrine and is reviewable under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. However, we must exercise caution when exercising interlocutory review, as it may disrupt the normal appellate process and create the potential for piecemeal appeals. (913 F.2d 205)

In addition, our cases establish that the question of whether to exercise jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine must “be examined in the light of practical, rather than narrowly technical, considerations.” In the matter of Covington Grain Co., Inc., 638 F.2d 1357, 1360 (5th Cir.
