Regarding the legal cases, it's essential to analyze the deficient performance of counsel and the prejudice caused by that performance. In the case of Mullins v. State, 315 F.3d 449, the court held that the defendant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to call a witness who could have testified about the defendant's character. The court reasoned that the witness's testimony would not have changed the outcome of the case, and therefore, the defendant was not prejudiced by the counsel's decision.

Similarly, in Sayre v. Anderson, 238 F.3d 631, the court held that the defendant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to call a witness who could have testified about the defendant's innocence. The court reasoned that the witness's testimony would not have been credible, and therefore, the defendant was not prejudiced by the counsel's decision.

In the case at hand, the defendant's counsel did not call certain witnesses who could have testified about the defendant's character. However, the court found that the witnesses' testimony would not have changed the outcome of the case, and therefore, the defendant was not prejudiced by the counsel's decision. The court also found that the defendant's counsel's decision not to call the witnesses was a strategic one, and therefore, it was not objectively unreasonable.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is consistent with the principles established in Mullins v. State and Sayre v. Anderson. The court held that the defendant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to call certain witnesses, and that the defendant was not prejudiced by the counsel's decision. The court also found that the counsel's decision not to call the witnesses was a strategic one, and therefore, it was not objectively unreasonable.

gold_text: The district court’s ruling on this issue notably omitted any discussion of Strickland, such as why Williams’s decision to counsel against Harris testifying was “objectively unreasonable” or how it prejudiced Harris. A defendant who argues that his attorney prevented him from testifying must still satisfy the two prongs of Strickland, however. United States v. Mullins, 315 F.3d 449, 452 (5th Cir.2002); Sayre v. Anderson, 238 F.3d 631, 634 (5th Cir.2001). A criminal defendant’s right to testify is well established, and only the defendant can waive this right, not his counsel. Mullins, 315 F.3d at 452. That waiver must be knowing and voluntary. Id.
