Plaintiff argues that the City's non-renewal of the janitorial contract constituted retaliation for exercising his First Amendment rights, as per 42 U.S.C. § 1983. In assessing the balance between the City's interest as a contractor and the plaintiff's free speech rights, we reference the test established in Pickering v. Board of Ed., 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968). 

The Court must determine if the plaintiff's speech addressed matters of public concern and if the City’s actions were motivated by this speech. In Pickering, the Supreme Court emphasized the necessity of free and open debate on public issues without fear of retaliatory dismissals, crucial for fostering informed public decision-making.

The precedent set in Board members v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, further supports this assessment, extending First Amendment protections to independent contractors facing retaliatory governmental action. Applying these principles, the Court must weigh the City's operational interests against the plaintiff's rights to free expression.

Given these considerations, the plaintiff's claim of First Amendment retaliation under § 1983 demands scrutiny against established doctrines. The City must provide substantial justification for the contract termination unrelated to plaintiff’s speech.

Thus, the Court denies the City's motion for summary judgment on the § 1983 First Amendment retaliation claim, permitting the claim to proceed to trial for further examination based on the criteria outlined by Pickering and reinforced by the relevant cases (518 U.S. 668, 391 U.S. 563).

To determine the extent of protection, courts weigh the government’s interests as contractor, against the free speech interests at stake. Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 672,116 S.Ct. 2342 (citing Pickering v.

To prevail on his First Amendment claim, plaintiff must show that the termination of his contract was motivated by his speech on a matter of public concern. Id. at 675, 116 S.Ct. 2342 (speech on private employment matters unprotected). If he can do so, the City will have a valid defense if it can show that it would have terminated his contract regardless of his speech or that its legitimate interests outweighed plaintiffs free speech interests.
