However, the doctrine of equitable tolling applies in this case, allowing the government to proceed with the civil forfeiture action despite the lapse of the statutory period. The Third Circuit has acknowledged that, under certain circumstances, equitable tolling can apply to civil forfeiture actions (United States v. One Toshiba Color Television, 213 F.3d 147, 156 (3d Cir. 2000)). In the present case, the government's delay in commencing judicial forfeiture proceedings arose from the necessity to rectify the inadequate notice initially provided. Additionally, the reference case 322 F.3d 758 illustrates a similar scenario where administrative forfeiture proceedings were voided due to improper notice, and equitable tolling permitted the subsequent judicial action.

Considering the seriousness of the underlying narcotics trafficking charges and the significant public interest in forfeiture proceedings connected to criminal activities, it is justifiable to toll the statute of limitations. Therefore, the government's prompt action following the court's directive to initiate judicial forfeiture proceedings falls within an equitable framework, thus aligning with the referenced precedents to support the timely filing of the present complaint.

gold_text: In United States v. One Toshiba Color Television, 213 F.3d 147 (3d Cir.2000), the Third Circuit stated that a judgment of forfeiture is void without adequate notice. Id. at 156. While the Circuit concluded the doctrine of laches was not available to preclude a claimant from challenging a void judgment, it specifically reserved judgment on whether the statute of limitations prohibited the government from reinitiating the forfeiture action, or if the statute of limitations should be tolled. See id. at 158-59. In Longenette v. Krusing, 322 F.3d 758 (3d Cir.2003), the Third Circuit permitted equitable tolling of the statute of limitations. Prisoner William Longenette challenged the administrative forfeiture of his van after he had been arrested on drug-related charges. Id. at 759-60. Because Mr. Longenette had not timely returned his in forma pauperis declaration in lieu of the mandatory bond, the FBI proceeded with the administrative forfeiture. Id. at 760. The Third Circuit concluded that the prison mailbox rule applied, so the date on which Mr. Longenette gave his in forma pauperis declaration to prison authorities for mailing was considered the filing date, and Mr. Lon-genette’s challenge of the administrative forfeiture was timely. Id. at 765. When an administrative forfeiture is voidable, the remedy is to vacate the forfeiture and refer the matter to the local United States Attorney’s office for judicial forfeiture. Id. at 766. However, judicial forfeiture of Mr. Longenette’s van would have violated the five-year statute of limitations for such proceedings.
