In this case, the Court concludes that the foreclosure sale is void due to the violation of the automatic stay. The automatic stay is triggered by the commencement of the bankruptcy case, and it applies to all entities, including creditors. The stay prohibits any action to obtain possession of property of the estate, which includes the foreclosure of the property. In this case, the foreclosure sale was conducted after the bankruptcy case was filed, and therefore, it violated the automatic stay.

The Court also notes that the foreclosure sale was not authorized under the Bankruptcy Code or by the court, as required by 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(3). The sale was not even scheduled by the debtor, and the creditor did not receive notice of the bankruptcy case. Therefore, the sale was not a good faith sale, and it is not protected by § 549(e).

In fact, the Court has held that § 549(c) is inapplicable in this context. Section 549(c) provides an exception to the trustee's right to avoid a transfer of property under § 549(a), but this case does not involve an avoidance action under § 549(a). Rather, the Court is set aside the foreclosure sale because it violated the automatic stay.

Furthermore, the Court notes that the Bankruptcy Code provides a mechanism for the retroactive relief from the automatic stay, as stated in 11 U.S.C. § 362(d). Therefore, the Court finds that the foreclosure sale is void and that the debtor's property is protected by the automatic stay.

gold_text: A number of cases have held that § 549(c) does provide an exception to § 362(a). See In re Taylor, 884 F.2d 478 (9th Cir.1989); In re Carpio, 213 B.R. 744 (Bankr.W.D.Mo. 1997); In re D’Alfonso, 211 B.R. 508 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.1997); In re Hill, 156 B.R. 998 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1993). However, these cases are inconsistent with the plain language of the §§ 362(a) and 549. Further, this line of cases is inconsistent with the Sixth Circuit’s holding in Easley.
