Nguyen's arguments on reasonableness are unavailing. According to case law, a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range is presumed reasonable (431 F.3d 784). Nguyen's sentence, at the low end of the range, follows this presumption. Nguyen fails to establish how the district court's process or the substance of the sentence was unreasonable. The district court's thorough consideration of § 3553(a) factors further supports the sentence's reasonableness, including Nguyen's criminal history and the severity of his offense (483 F.3d 739). The district court's decision to impose a sentence consistent with the Guidelines and Nguyen's failure to object to the facts substantiating the sentence eliminates the claim of procedural error. Thus, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment.
