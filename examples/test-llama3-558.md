In the case of Gloria Hutchison, the court reviewed the Secretary's denial of disability benefits to a widow, determining whether her depression met the statutory and regulatory disability standards. The court held that the Secretary's findings were conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. The court applied the proper disability standard, focusing on whether the widow's impairments were of such severity as to bar an individual from engaging in any gainful activity, rather than whether her physical and mental condition barred her from gainful employment.

The court found that the record evidence supported both conclusions: that the widow's depression was an impairment of disabling severity that persisted for at least twelve continuous months, and that it was not. The court rejected Dr. Davies' opinion as conclusory and based on an erroneous standard. The court also found that Dr. Adamo's testimony, which was based on a review of the record, was consistent with the record evidence and supported the Secretary's denial of benefits.

In United States v. DiRe, 332 U.S. 581 (1948), the court held that the missing witness inference did not require the trial judge to assume that the missing witness would have supported the government's case. Similarly, in this case, the court did not find that the missing treatment notes from Dr. Davies or the lack of lay reports from family and friends required a finding of disability.

The court's decision was also supported by the regulations and the listing of qualifying impairments for each body system. The court found that the widow's depression was not severe enough to meet the listing criteria for a continuous twelve-month period. The court's decision was affirmed, and the Secretary's denial of benefits was upheld.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case demonstrates the importance of applying the proper disability standard and the need to focus on the severity of the impairment rather than the individual's ability to engage in gainful employment. The court's decision is consistent with the holding in United States v. DiRe, 332 U.S. 581 (1948), and demonstrates the importance of considering all evidence in the record when making a determination of disability.
