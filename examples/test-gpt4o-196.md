**Generation:**

Appellant Vernon Robert Lindholm’s key arguments in his appeal revolve around allegations of insufficient evidence and procedural errors during his trial. Drawing parallels from the reference cases, several points can be further clarified.

In reference case **678 F.2d 856**, it was established that the belief in the invalidity of a bankruptcy proceeding is irrelevant to the intent required for concealment and withholding property charges. Similar reasoning can be applied to Lindholm’s assertion that his actions were due to a belief that his previous petitions were non-material and thus non-disclosable. The court in **678 F.2d 856** firmly ruled that such beliefs do not negate fraudulent intent.

Moreover, the court in **678 F.2d 856** also concluded there was sufficient evidence for concealment and fraudulent intent. Applying this to Lindholm’s case, despite his claims of the properties’ uninhabitability and omitted filings, his actions—repeated fraudent bankruptcy filings to stay evictions—demonstrate a clear intent to misuse the bankruptcy process for personal gain. Consequently, Lindholm’s reliance on a supposed lack of materiality or fraudulent intent does not hold, as evidenced by the court in the referenced case.

Thus, based on **678 F.2d 856**, the district court was correct in its findings, indicating that substantial evidence supports Lindholm’s convictions, dismissing his claims of lacking materiality and fraudulent intent.

Although appellant claims at the time he signed such statement he was under the impression that his prior bankruptcies had been dismissed, he has also claimed that he is a cum laude graduate of the University of Southern California, that he had attended Western Law School and that he represented himself in both state civil cases and federal bankruptcy court. This cuts against the credibility of the claim that he was under the impression that the prior bankruptcies were dismissed. Moreover, regardless of his belief, appellant was under a duty to disclose all prior bankruptcy filings and their- subsequent disposition notwithstanding whether such prior bankruptcies had been dismissed or not. See United States v. Beery, 678 F.2d 856 (10th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1066, 105 S.Ct. 2142, 85 L.Ed.2d 499 (1985) (even if defendant had considered bankruptcy proceeding to be invalid, that would not preclude convicting him of concealing assets from receiver and trustee in bankruptcy).
