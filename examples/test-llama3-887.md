The legal cases provided, 501 F.2d 1006 and 446 U.S. 398, offer valuable insights into the realm of legal considerations. In the former case, the court emphasizes the importance of statutory limits in determining the sentence for a white-collar crime. The court concludes that a sentence within the statutory limits is not cruel and unusual punishment, and therefore, will not be disturbed on appeal.

In the latter case, the court addresses the issue of congressional authority to define crimes and prescribe punishments. The court holds that Congress has the power to determine what constitutes a crime and what punishment is appropriate, and that the judiciary should respect this authority.

In the context of the legal issues presented in the original write-up, these cases offer relevant guidance. For instance, the court's consideration of statutory limits in 501 F.2d 1006 may be applicable to the case of the appellants, who were convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 111 and § 2. The court's emphasis on the importance of following statutory limits may influence its decision on the appellants' appeal.

Similarly, the court's discussion of congressional authority in 446 U.S. 398 may be relevant to the case of the IRS agents, who were attempting to seize the appellants' property. The court's holding that Congress has the power to define crimes and prescribe punishments may be used to justify the IRS's actions in seizing the property.

Overall, these cases offer valuable insights into the legal considerations that are relevant to the case of the appellants. By applying the principles and concepts discussed in these cases, the court may be able to make a more informed decision on the appellants' appeal.

gold_text: Last, appellants argue that they were charged under the wrong statute and that the sentences they received constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Appellants’ assertion of cruel and unusual punishment must fail because the sentences they received were all within the statutory limits. United States v. MacClain, 501 F.2d 1006, 1013 (10th Cir.1974). However, Busic v. United States, 446 U.S. 398, 100 S.Ct. 1747, 64 L.Ed.2d 381 (1980) compels us to vacate the probationary sentences received by Afflerbach, John Cotton, and Michael Cotton for violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). Because these appellants were convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 111, which contains its own enhancement of sentence provision, their sentences cannot be further enhanced by § 924(c). Thus, although we affirm all the appellants’ convictions and sentences under § 111, we must vacate the sentences received by Afflerbach, John Cotton, and Michael Cotton under § 924(c).
