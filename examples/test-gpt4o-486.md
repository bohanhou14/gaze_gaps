However, this standard must be carefully applied to avoid chilling the legitimate zeal of attorneys representing their clients within the bounds of the law (738 F.2d 223). The court must ensure attorneys are provided with fair notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record before sanctions are imposed, following due process protections (738 F.2d 223). Conduct that is objectively unreasonable and vexatious may warrant sanctions under § 1927 if it involves intent, recklessness, or bad faith (769 F.2d 441, 73 F.3d 262). Here, the district court erred in finding reckless disregard solely based on the omission of Quinones, especially considering the backdrop of relevant New Mexico case law discussed by both parties. This oversight does not suffice as substantial evidence of bad faith or unreasonable conduct warranting § 1927 sanctions (768 F.2d 1159, 915 F.2d 1414). Therefore, the imposition of attorney's fees and costs against Mr. Graham must be reversed as it does not meet the stringent requirements necessary under § 1927 (769 F.2d 441, 34 F.3d 1291).

gold_text: This standard is then used to decide whether “by acting recklessly or with indifference to the law, as well as by acting in the teeth of what he knows to be the law,” an attorney subjects himself to sanctions under § 1927. In re TCI Ltd., 769 F.2d 441, 445 (7th Cir.1985). “A lawyer’s reckless indifference to the law may impose substantial costs on the adverse party. Section 1927 permits a court to insist that the attorney bear the costs of his own lack of care.” Id. Sanctions are appropriate, then, when an attorney is cavalier or “bent on misleading the court,” Herzfeld & Stern v. Blair, 769 F.2d 645, 647 (10th Cir.1985); intentionally acts without a plausible basis, Knorr Brake Corp. v. Harbil, Inc., 738 F.2d 223, 227 (7th Cir.1984); when the entire course of the proceedings was unwarranted, FDIC v. Calhoun, 34 F.3d 1291 (5th Cir.1994); or when certain discovery is substantially unjustified and interposed for the improper purposes of harassment, unnecessary delay and to increase the costs of the litigation, Resolution Trust Corp. v. Dabney, 73 F.3d 262 (10th Cir.1995). Because § 1927 is penal in nature, “the award should be made ‘only in instances evidencing serious and standard disregard for the orderly process of justice.’ ” White v. American Airlines, Inc., 915 F.2d 1414, 1427 (10th Cir.1990) (quoting Dreiling v. Peugeot Motors of Am., Inc., 768 F.2d 1159, 1165 (10th Cir.1985)).
