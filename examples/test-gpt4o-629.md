Based on the principles outlined in the reference cases, the preemptive effect of federal law over state regulation can be evaluated through both statutory intent and practical outcomes. In reference case 451 U.S. 504, the Supreme Court deliberated on whether federal regulation under ERISA precludes state laws that interfere with specific provisions of a pension plan. Similarly, in 414 U.S. 117, the court considered if federal objectives inherently preempt state laws that control commercial conduct within a state's jurisdiction.

In applying these principles to the current case, it must be noted that the DRG system, while a state initiative, does not fall within the explicitly preempted categories enumerated in 42 U.S.C. § 300e-10. While the DRG plan indirectly affects HCP's financial health by eliminating per diem contracts, this does not inherently frustrate the broader federal objectives of the Health Maintenance Organization Act. Analogous to the findings in 451 U.S. 504, where offsets against state-provided benefits were not inherently unlawful under federal directives, the state's implementation of the DRG system does not in itself conflict with the purpose of federal HMO regulation. Thus, under the doctrine elucidated in 414 U.S. 117, state regulation is not preempted unless it unmistakably contravenes federal provisions, which is not evident in this case.

Therefore, the DRG system, designed for equitable hospital rate setting, does not violate congressional intent or render the federal laws ineffectual. This supports the conclusion that HCP’s financial difficulties arise more from operational deficiencies rather than intrinsic conflicts between state and federal law.

gold_text: Plaintiff contends that the existence of per diem contracts has been the reason why HCP has kept its costs down and the reason why the public would be induced to enroll as members of HCP. The per diem contracts, also, had given HMOs like HCP a competitive advantage over more traditional sources of medical care, because they had given HCP physicians a financial inducement to reduce the amount of time spent in hospitals by HCP subscribers. Under the DRG system, the advantage derived from the shortening of hospital stays shifts to the hospitals themselves, along with the inducement to do so. Nevertheless it cannot be said that HCP has thereby lost its entire competitive advantage. By the use of pre-hospitalization testing and by emphasis on preventive care, HMOs remain in a unique position to minimize the costs to its subscribers. Moreover, there is no basis for the assertion that Congress intended to give HMOs a competitive advantage in the medical marketplace. The act dealing with HMOs contains several provisions which set HMOs on an equal footing with other medical care suppliers, see, 42 U.S.C. section 300e-10, 300e-ll, but there is no provision which is aimed at guaranteeing that they will forever thrive in the competitive marketplace. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that state regulation is not to be displaced by a federal program unless “Congress has unmistakably so ordained.” Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U.S. 504, 101 S.Ct. 1895, 1905, 68 L.Ed.2d 402 (1981). Because Congressional intent to preempt state laws is not to be lightly inferred, e.g., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Ware, 414 U.S. 117, 127, 94 S.Ct. 383, 389, 38 L.Ed.2d 248 (1973), the court declines to give the expansive reading to the federal statutes which the plaintiff advocates.
