After carefully reviewing the reference cases, it is evident that the combination of features from Vokes and Pumps would be obvious to one skilled in the art. In reference case 136 F.2d 918, the court held that the appealed claims involve invention and are patentable, but only because the reference did not suggest that the combination of elements could be made without exercise of the inventive faculty. In this case, the references clearly suggest that the combination of features from Vokes and Pumps would be obvious and not require any inventive effort.

Furthermore, the references themselves demonstrate the obviousness of the combination. Vokes discloses a method of forming a filter in which a pleated filter element is positioned between flat parallel apertured sheets or end members, while Pumps discloses a method of forming a filter in which conical sections or rings are cut from a hollow filter paper cone and joined to one another along the edges and attached to a pair of circular parallel apertured plates by an adhesive or cement. These references demonstrate that the combination of features from Vokes and Pumps would be a straightforward and obvious application of the prior art.

In reference case 329 F.2d 321, the court similarly held that the combination of features from Vokes and Pumps would be obvious, stating that it would be obvious for one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize filter paper per se or in combination with adhesive and or card board apertured plates in the method taught by Pumps, in view of Vokes. The court further noted that the references disclosed the use of filter paper and adhesive for securing apertured cardboard plates thereto, and that it would be obvious to combine these features with the method taught by Pumps.

In light of these references, it is clear that the combination of features from Vokes and Pumps would be obvious to one skilled in the art, and therefore, claims 14 and 16-18 would be unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. ยง 103.
