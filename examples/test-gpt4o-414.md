**Generation:**

In the present case, plaintiff’s claims of retaliatory discharge fail to establish the necessary causal connection. As held in the case of Cooper v. City of North Olmsted, 795 F.2d 1265, the mere proximity in time between the plaintiff’s EEOC complaint and subsequent termination does not sufficiently evidence retaliatory motive. The court requires more substantial evidence demonstrating that the termination was significantly motivated by retaliatory intent (795 F.2d 1265).

Further, plaintiff fails to provide adequate proof, analogous to the ruling in Bires v. Fred Meyer, 686 F.2d 793, where evidence of discriminatory intent or motive was essential for a disparate treatment claim. Just as in Bires, where intent to implement legitimate business policy negated allegations of retaliation, Standard’s adherence to its policy regarding falsification of insurance claims undermines plaintiff's claims of retaliatory discharge (686 F.2d 793).

Thus, without concrete evidence showing a direct link between plaintiff’s protected activity and her termination, the claim of retaliatory discharge cannot stand. Summary judgment is appropriate since plaintiff has not presented specific facts establishing a genuine issue for trial on this matter.
