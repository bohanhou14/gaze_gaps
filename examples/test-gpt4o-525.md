Though the appellant argues the presence of "prosecutorial self-contradiction," his standing to challenge the search under the importation count must be dismissed. The prosecutorial theory does not mandate possession as an essential element for an importation charge, contrary to the automatic standing invoked in possession-related cases. The issue of standing in situations where the crime charged does not require possession was addressed in United States v. Valencia, 492 F.2d 1071 (9th Cir. 1974), where it was established that no automatic standing is conferred in importation cases.

Moreover, the distinction regarding possession being an essential element is further supported in United States v. Carrion, 463 F.2d 704, 706 (9th Cir. 1972), which held that co-conspirators lacking possession had no grounds for suppression motions. The reference case 474 F.2d 610 reinforces that aiding and abetting importation does not necessitate actual possession, fortifying the lack of standing.

Furthermore, 357 F.2d 124 delineates standing requirements post-Jones, emphasizing that intrusion on privacy or possession at the search time must be evident. Given the appellant's scenario, where the search's intrusion did not directly target him, the rationale on standing does not apply as rigidly.

Thus, the appellantâ€™s position lacks the necessary criteria for automatic standing under the relevant precedents, thereby validating the court's decision to deny the suppression motion for the importation count.
