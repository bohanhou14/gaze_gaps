In re Fridolph, 136 F.2d 918, establishes that it is permissible to combine multiple references to negate patentability, as long as the combination is non-obvious to a person skilled in the art. Similarly, the board has correctly determined that the method claims in this case (14, 16-18) would have been obvious when considering Vokes and Pumps together. The teachings of these references suggest a combination that a skilled artisan could make without exercising inventive faculty. 

The appellant's stance that the combination of features from Vokes and Pumps to create an obvious filter system is not persuasive. In 329 F.2d 321, the court noted that simply combining old elements that perform their expected function does not constitute a patentable invention. Here, the combination of Vokes’s method of using pleated elements with Pump’s method of using filter paper and adhesive clearly fits within this standard. Furthermore, the appellant's suggestion that the age of the references should influence the determination of obviousness is unsupported, as established in In re Beauchamp, 210 F.2d 309, 41 CCPA 791.

Thus, the decision of the board to affirm the rejection of claims 14 and 16-18 is well-founded in the principles articulated in the referenced cases. Appellant's arguments fail to overcome the clear disclosures and obvious combination indicated in the prior art references.
