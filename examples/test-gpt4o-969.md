In 17 B.T.A. 93, it has been established that the mere sharing of profits is a strong indicator of a partnership, even without a formal agreement or the explicit contribution of capital. The case clarifies that a husband can grant his wife an interest in a business, evidenced by the continuous arrangement and the wife’s reinvestment of profits. Similarly, in 6 B.T.A. 1123, it was acknowledged that at common law, the formation of a partnership does not necessitate a written contract, and spouses may validly form such a partnership. 

Moreover, 280 F. 457 demonstrates that the collaborative efforts and contributions of both spouses in their business ventures can substantiate claims of shared ownership, notwithstanding the lack of formal agreements. This precedent affirms the legal recognition of a spouse’s financial and labor contributions as equitable in the eyes of the court. Additionally, the observations from Champlin v. Commissioner, 71 F.2d 23 highlight that the existence of a profit-sharing agreement is paramount, irrespective of whether a formal partnership is established.

These precedents collectively bolster the notion that the $150 initial contribution, combined with the equitable division of labor and profits over decades, forms a basis for recognizing the wife’s financial interest in the jointly held properties and cash. The Board’s insistence on a more rigid partnership criterion, as suggested in 48 F.2d 600, overlooks the practicality and fairness entrenched in such marital business collaborations.

Thus, the record should reflect the equitable distribution of jointly accrued profits and properties between the surviving spouse and the decedent, consistent with established precedents.

gold_text: We may add that the existence of such a contract appears far from unlikely. By hypothesis, since the property is held jointly, the suspicion attaching to these agreements when urged as a basis for recovery against a decedent’s estate is lacking here. See In re Barnet’s Estate, 320 Pa. 408, 182 A. 699, but cf. Ellis v. Ellis, 51 App.D.C. 383, 280 F. 457. It is also to be observed that the much vexed problem of the allocation of taxable income between spouses has been solved (if any generalization is permissible) by allowing income to be split, where, as here, a part is the product of one spouse’s capital or services, M. L. Virden v. Com’r, 6 B.T.A. 1123; J. W. Brackman v. Com’r, 24 B.T.A. 259; H. S. Tuthill v. Com’r, 22 B.T.A. 887; John T. Newell v. Com’r, 17 B.T.A. 93, above cited; T. F. Kelley v. Com’r, 9 B.T.A. 834, above cited; Champlin v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 71 F.2d 23, above cited; Pugh v. United States, D.C., 48 F.2d 600. Compare Cohan v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 39 F. 2d 540; J. I. Robertson v. Com’r, 20 B.T. A. 112, 113; W. E. Buchanan v. Com’r, 20 B.T.A. 210. So the suspicion that husband and wife are conniving in a scheme of tax avoidance yields to the economic reality of the wife’s actual participation in business, even if it is her husband’s. That reality, furthermore, is not rare. Indeed a farflung system of marital property has been based upon it. We quote: “The causes which made the wife the partner of the husband are of an economical nature rather than a moral nature * * * In towns, where family possessions are rarely met with, there is nothing to offer an obstacle to its adoption; the marriage portion of the wife consists in the making of an investment, as would the share of a partner. The benefits resulting from commerce and industry, or acquests which are realized because of them, are shared, because the woman, owing to her fortune or activity, contributes to their production. Community is thus the matrimonial system 'of merchants”. Brissaud, History of French Private Law, sec. 554, pp. 817, 818
