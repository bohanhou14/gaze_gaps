ORDER TRANSFERRING VENUE
The Court has considered the motions to dismiss for improper venue and to transfer venue filed by the defendants. After careful review of the cases cited by both parties, the Court finds that the defendants have demonstrated a strong case for transfer of venue.

First, the defendants argue that the central district of California is the proper venue for this action, citing cases such as 864 F.2d 635 and 611 F.2d 270. In these cases, the courts held that a defendant's contacts with the forum, even if indirect, can establish venue. Here, the defendants have shown that they have significant contacts with the central district of California, including the location of their principal place of business and the location of the alleged misconduct.

Second, the defendants argue that the transfer of venue would be in the interest of justice, citing cases such as 805 F.2d 834. In this case, the court held that the transfer of venue was proper where the plaintiff had not demonstrated a substantial interest in the forum and the defendant had shown a strong interest in the forum. Here, the defendants have demonstrated a strong interest in the central district of California, including the location of their principal place of business and the location of the alleged misconduct.

Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the transfer of venue is proper and hereby orders the transfer of this action to the central district of California.

gold_text: Defendants move to transfer this action to the Central District of California. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), the court may transfer an action to any other district or division where it might have been brought “[fjor the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice.” Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 820 F.Supp. 503, 506 (C.D.Cal.1992). A convenience transfer under § 1404(a) requires the court to assess a variety of factors and “involves subtle considerations and is best left to the discretion of the trial judge.” Sparling v. Hoffman Construction, 864 F.2d 635,, 639 (9th Cir.1988). The court may consider the convenience of the parties and witnesses, and the promotion of judicial efficiency and economy in determining whether to transfer an action. Id. Private factors to be considered include the location where the operative events occurred, the convenience of the parties and non-party witnesses, the location of relevant evidence, the availability of compulsory process, and other practical considerations for the efficient and cost-effective resolution of claims. Decker Coal Co. v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 805 F.2d 834, 843 (9th Cir.1986). Courts also look to the so-called public factors such as relative docket congestion, the local public and jury pool’s interest in the controversy, and issues relative to judicial economy. Id. at 508-09. Defendants have the burden of demonstrating that transfer is appropriate. See Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Savage, 611 F.2d 270, 279 (9th Cir.1979).
