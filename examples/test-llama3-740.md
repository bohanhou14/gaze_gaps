In the case of Noel v. S. S. Marila, the court found that the shipowner and stevedore were both liable for the plaintiff's injuries. The court held that the shipowner's breach of its duty to provide a safe place to work was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries, and that the stevedore's breach of its implied warranty of workmanlike service was also a proximate cause.

The court further held that the shipowner's conduct was not sufficient to preclude indemnity, citing Ryan Stevedoring Co., Inc. v. Pan-Atlantic S.S. Corp., 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956). The court also noted that the stevedore was in the better position to prevent the accident and failed to take reasonable precautions to prevent it.

The court rejected the shipowner's argument that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, citing Burrage v. Flota Mercante Grancolombiana, S.A., 431 F.2d 1229, 1232 (5th Cir. 1970). The court found that the plaintiff was performing his assigned task in a reasonably safe manner and that his continued performance of his task did not constitute contributory negligence.

In conclusion, the court held that both the shipowner and stevedore were liable for the plaintiff's injuries and that the stevedore was obligated to indemnify the shipowner. The court's decision was based on the principles of maritime law and the doctrine of indemnity.
