The case of Toushin v. United States (1988) involves a dispute over the tax treatment of cash skimmed from a wholly owned corporation. The defendant, Steven Toushin, was convicted of tax fraud for failing to report income from his corporation, Entertainment & Amusement, Inc. The government's expert, Agent Czurylo, testified that the cash method of calculating unreported income, as outlined in reference case 886 F.2d 1497, is an admissible method of proof.

The district court instructed the jury that money skimmed from a wholly owned corporation is only taxable when used for personal benefit, citing reference case 348 U.S. 121. However, this instruction was erroneous, as it did not account for the possibility that the defendant may have exercised control over the funds prior to their use.

The court held that the erroneous instruction was not harmless, as it may have led the jury to convict the defendant based on the incorrect assumption that the funds were not taxable until used for personal benefit. The court noted that the government's evidence did not preclude the possibility that the defendant may have had a cash hoard prior to 1980, and that the jury may have convicted the defendant based on the erroneous instruction.

In conclusion, the case highlights the importance of accurately instructing the jury on the tax treatment of cash skimmed from a wholly owned corporation. The court's errors in this case led to an unfair conviction, and the case serves as a reminder of the need for careful consideration of the tax implications of cash transactions. <answer>
