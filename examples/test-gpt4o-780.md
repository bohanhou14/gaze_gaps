Given the decision to dismiss the federal claim under the Sherman Act, the court must next address whether it should exercise pendent jurisdiction over the state law claims. Reference case 328 F.2d 300 clarifies that if substantial federal claims are dismissed and no significant judicial resources have been expended on the state claims, the court should ordinarily dismiss the state claims without prejudice. Here, like in the Wham-O-Mfg. Co. case, the court has devoted minimal time and resources to the state claims.

Additionally, reference case 289 U.S. 238 emphasizes that if a federal question is wrongly determined, it should not stand as a precedent. Applying this principle, the court finds no substantial grounds for exercising jurisdiction over the state law claims. The interest of judicial economy dictates that these claims be resolved in state court, which is consistent with the mandates of sound discretion and valid jurisdictional practice.

Given the circumstances and precedents, the court dismisses the state law claims without prejudice, leaving the plaintiff the option to pursue these claims in state court.

Thus, the court's decision aligns with the established legal principles and case law. The federal claims are dismissed for lack of substantial effect on interstate commerce, and the state claims are dismissed on jurisdictional grounds as guided by 328 F.2d 300 and 289 U.S. 238.

The judgments of the district court are in all respects affirmed.

gold_text: The court is urged to assume pendent jurisdiction. While the dismissal of a federal claim does not automatically remove jurisdiction in a federal court to hear a state claim, the exercise of jurisdiction is nonetheles in the sound discretion of the court. Sunbeam Lighting Co. v. Pacific Associated Lighting Inc., 328 F.2d 300 (9th Cir. 1964). The court should consider whether the federal claim is substantial at least to the extent that it can overcome a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and whether the federal and state claims arise out of the same operative facts. In re Union National Bank & Trust Co. of Souderton, Pa., 298 F.Supp. 422 (E.D. Pa.1969); Edward J. Moriarty & Co. v. General Tire & Rubber Co., 289 F.Supp. 381 (S.D.Ohio 1967); Robinson & Sons Inc. v. Mister Donut of America Inc., 270 F.Supp. 99 (D.Mass.1967). Amere adverse decision on the merits of the federal claim does not mean that it is insubstantial. Hurn v. Oursler, 289 U.S. 238, 53 S.Ct. 586, 77 L.Ed. 1148 (1933). However it would appear that in a case such as at bar where the federal claim cannot withstand a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, it is not substantial in the sense of dictating that the court accept pendent jurisdiction. If the federal claim here were considered substantial, then an aggrieved party could sue in federal court any time based on state claims by merely asserting that the Sherman Act is violated.
