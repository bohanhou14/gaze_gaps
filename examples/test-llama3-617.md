The legal cases provided are a mix of appeals and reversals of Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare decisions. Notably, the case of Mitchell v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 353, 316 F.2d 354 (1963) highlights the importance of considering the frequency and severity of an appellant's seizures, as well as the administrative agency's decision being conclusive even if the agency proceeded on the assumption of a medically determinable condition. This is in line with the court's finding in Jones v. Celebrezze, 331 F.2d 226 (7th Cir. 1964), that the Secretary does not have the burden to "spell out" available work opportunities.

In the case of Easttam v. Gardner, 364 F.2d 509, the court examined the question of disability and its impact on an individual's ability to engage in substantial gainful work. The court found that the claimant's impairment was not of such severity as to prevent him from engaging in substantial gainful work, citing the medical reports that indicated the condition was controlled and somewhat alleviated with antihistamine treatment.

The case of Adams v. Flemming, 276 F.2d 901, highlights the importance of considering the evidence presented and the burden of proof on the claimant. In this case, the court found that the claimant had failed to demonstrate the existence of a disability within the meaning of ยง 223(d) prior to age 18, and that the Secretary's denial of benefits was supported by substantial evidence.

In conclusion, these cases demonstrate the importance of considering the frequency and severity of an individual's condition, as well as the burden of proof on the claimant. They also highlight the importance of considering the administrative agency's decision and the evidence presented in determining the outcome of a disability claim.
