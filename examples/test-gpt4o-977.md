Our analysis finds further support in precedent cases. The framework set forth in 395 U.S. 352 clarifies that federal law is "exclusive" in its regulation of the OCS, and state law is only adopted as surrogate federal law to the extent it is “not inconsistent with [federal law].” This understanding aligns with the district court’s reliance on § 1333(a)(2)(A) of the OCSLA, reinforcing that federal law supplants state law where an applicable federal statute addresses the legal issue in question.

Similarly, in 417 F.2d 1030, the court emphasized that state laws apply on the OCS only if they are both “applicable and not inconsistent with federal laws.” This principle was key in determining that the Direct Action Statute could not extend Louisiana law to the OCS indiscriminately without considering federal provisions.

Therefore, appellant's reliance on 43 U.S.C. § 1333(b) and state law is misplaced. The exclusive federal remedy provided by the LHWCA’s retaliatory discharge provision, 33 U.S.C. § 948a, already governs the matter. The surrogate adoption of state law as federal law does not apply when a comprehensive federal statute is in place, as it would render the intended uniform federal protections null.

Thus, the district court correctly concluded that appellant must seek remedy under the LHWCA rather than Louisiana law, as federal jurisdiction prevails concerning the OCS. Accordingly, Chevron's motion for summary judgment was rightly granted.
