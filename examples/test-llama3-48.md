In the present case, the Tax Court held that the royalty payments to Mrs. Thomas were not ordinary and necessary business expenses, citing principles of Pennsylvania law. However, in determining the tax implications of these payments, we must consider federal tax law, as established in cases such as Commissioner v. Tower, 66 S.Ct. 532, 536, and Commissioner v. Lusthaus, 66 S.Ct. 539, 540.

As the Supreme Court stated in Commissioner v. Tower, the question of who earned the income and who controlled the income is crucial in determining tax liability. Similarly, in Commissioner v. Lusthaus, the Court held that transactions between husband and wife calculated to reduce family taxes should be subjected to special scrutiny.

In this case, the Tax Court's findings were supported by a sufficient number of other factors in the transaction, and its holding as to the completeness of the gift was correct. The court's decision is consistent with the principles established in cases such as Commissioner v. Tower and Commissioner v. Lusthaus, which emphasize the importance of considering federal tax law in determining the tax implications of transactions.

In conclusion, the royalty payments to Mrs. Thomas were not ordinary and necessary business expenses, and the Tax Court's decision is consistent with federal tax law. The case is similar to Commissioner v. Tower, where the Court held that the creation of a partnership between husband and wife did not necessarily mean that the income earned was taxable to the wife. Similarly, in Commissioner v. Lusthaus, the Court held that transactions between husband and wife calculated to reduce family taxes should be subjected to special scrutiny.

Therefore, the Tax Court's decision is supported by the principles established in these cases, and it is consistent with federal tax law. <answer>

gold_text: As we see it the pending issue is directly within the scope of the Tower and Lus-thaus opinions. In Tower, the Supreme Court accepted the possibility of the Michigan law upholding the stock transfer and thus validating Mrs. Tower’s title to the stock but the Court said in effect that such final state conclusion could not govern the question of the federal taxability of the stock to the husband. In Lusthaus the cloak of legal respectability under Pennsylvania law could not be recognized for income tax purposes. Here the Tax Court heard and for all practical purposes reheard the matter and decided the mixed questions of law and fact which arose. Later on, in a suit started after the Tax Court opinions had been filed, the state court upheld the royalty contract on facts agreed between the parties. That decision cannot hamper “the effective enforcement of a valid federal tax levied against earned income.” And the decision of the Tax Court under all the circumstances and predicated on the mixed questions of law and fact involved is final. Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U.S. 489, 64 S.Ct. 239, 88 L.Ed. 248; John Kelley v. Commissioner, 326 U.S. 521, 66 S.Ct. 299.
