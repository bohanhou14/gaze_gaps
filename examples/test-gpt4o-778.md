The standards for granting a preliminary injunction, as elucidated in Gulf & Western Industries, Inc. v. The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc., 476 F.2d 687 (2d Cir. 1973), were not adequately met by the District Court. The precedent establishes that a preliminary injunction should be issued only upon a clear showing of either probable success on the merits and possible irreparable injury, or sufficiently serious questions going to the merits with the balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the relief (see 501 F.2d 687; 483 F.2d 247). 

The District Court's erroneous legal premises significantly impaired its evaluation of Modern Controls' request for preliminary injunctive relief. It failed to properly weigh the substantial probability of success Modern Controls demonstrated regarding the enforceability of the covenant not to compete. Additionally, the potential for irreparable harm due to the risk of confidential information being subtly disclosed to Burroughs Corporation was not sufficiently acknowledged. Consequently, in accordance with the criteria set by prior rulings (see Sonesta Int’l Hotels Corp. v. Wellington Associates, 483 F.2d 247), the preliminary injunction should have been granted, underscoring the necessity to reverse and remand the case for further proceedings. 

Therefore, we hold that the District Court's denial of preliminary injunctive relief was an abuse of discretion, necessitating reversal as per Fennell v. Butler, 570 F.2d 263 (8th Cir. 1978).

gold_text: . This Circuit has recently adopted an alternative test for preliminary injunctive relief developed by the Second Circuit. Relief is appropriate under this test if there are sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardship tips decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary relief. Fennell v. Butler, 570 F.2d 263, 264 (8th Cir. 1978). See Greshan v. Chambers, 501 F.2d 687, 691 (2d Cir. 1974); Sonesta lnt’l Hotels Corp. v. Wellington Associates, 483 F.2d 247, 250 (2d Cir. 1973). The District Court determined that Modern Controls was not entitled to relief under either test.
