In addition to my previous findings, it is essential to address the defendant’s reliance on Equity Rule 25 for the motion to dismiss. The goal, as noted in 248 F. 944, is not solely brevity but also the clarity of ultimate facts. While plaintiff’s detailed pleading of notice and knowledge may aim to demonstrate due diligence, this court previously found such extensive detail unnecessary. Indeed, in 222 F. 950, the importance of brevity and simplicity in allegations was emphasized. The requirement is that a bill should sufficiently support the claims without overburdening the pleadings with evidentiary details.

Given the plaintiff’s inclination to include eight pages of detailed allegations in paragraph 13, which over-express evidentiary matters rather than ultimate facts, the motion to dismiss holds merit. As previously ruled in Wollensak v. Reiher, 116 U.S. 96; Lockhart v. Leeds, 195 U.S. 427; and Edison Electric Co. v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of United States, 55 F. 478, the detailed correspondence and intricate particulars of notice, while possibly relevant for proving due diligence, need not be embedded within the initial pleadings.

Therefore, plaintiff’s inclusion of such specifics conflicts with the simplified framework intended by Equity Rule 25 and upheld in both 248 F. 944 and 222 F. 950, justifying the motion to dismiss.

gold_text: 1 cannot see the bearing of that section on the question here in issue. That relates merely to the matter of damages, and, if the plaintiff gets as far as an interlocutory decree herein, it would be entirely possible to show in the accounting proceeding such facts as would justify treble damages. The case of Foster v. Callaghan & Co. (D. C.) 248 F. 944, can readily be distinguished from the present pleading; and Pittsburgh Water Heater Co. v. Beler Water Heater Co. (D. C.) 222 F. 950, 953, decided shortly after the new rules went into effect, was in effect a statement that the aim of the rule (i. e., Equity Rule 25) is “brevity and simplicity of allegations in bills, and the profession should lend their aid to such end.” Later authorities cited in this opinion, as I have indicated, take a stricter view of the rule.
