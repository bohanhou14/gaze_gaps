In the case of Slotky v. Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, the court had to determine whether the notice of withdrawal liability to the defendant was adequate. The court held that notice to one member of a controlled group is notice to all, citing cases such as Trustees v. Central Transport, Inc., 888 F.2d 1161, 1163 (7th Cir.1989). The court also noted that the purpose of the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments is to prevent the dissipation of assets required to secure vested pension benefits.

The court also considered the argument that the notice was defective as to form because it did not set forth a schedule of payments of the assessed liability, citing 29 U.S.C. § 1399(b)(1)(A)(ii). However, the court held that notice to Stevens is notice to Slotky, and that the schedule of payments was in fact attached to the notice and demand.

In a similar case, United States v. Inslaw, Inc., 932 F.2d 1467, 1473 (D.C.Cir.1991), the court held that the automatic stay is the instrument that accomplishes the centralization of claims. The court also noted that the stay achieved its purpose and came to a natural end.

In another case, Republic Industries, Inc. v. Teamsters Joint Council No. 83 of Virginia Pension Fund, 718 F.2d 628, 634-35 (4th Cir.1983), the court held that the requirement of notice to one member of a controlled group is not jurisdictional.

The court in this case also considered the argument that the plan's filing in the bankruptcy court violated Bankruptcy Rule 3001(c), which requires that a claim based on a writing be accompanied by the writing. However, the court held that a technical violation of the bankruptcy rules would not invalidate the pension fund's filing as effective notice under the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments.

In conclusion, the court held that the notice of withdrawal liability to the defendant was adequate, and that notice to one member of a controlled group is notice to all. The court also considered the argument that the notice was defective as to form, but held that the schedule of payments was in fact attached to the notice and demand.

gold_text: As for the automatic stay, there is admittedly an analogy between an outright suit against the bankrupt, which would incontrovertibly violate the stay, § 362(a)(1), and a notice and demand that kicks off a sequence of conciliation and arbitration which may well result in an arbitrator’s order — equivalent to, because enforceable by, a legal judgment — against the bankrupt. The analogy may fail, for while the automatic stay probably applies to arbitra-tions equally with adjudications, In re T.D.M.A., Inc., 66 B.R. 992, 996 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1986); In re Cott Corp., 26 B.R. 332, 336 (Bankr.D.Conn.1982); H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 340-42 (1977) U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1978, pp. 5787, 6296-6298, an initial demand does not inaugurate a litigation or even create a lien (another act barred by the automatic stay. In re H & H Beverage Distributors, 850 F.2d 165, 167 (3d Cir.1988)). But even if the demand violated the automatic stay, all that this would mean, it seems to us, so far as bears on this case (for the violation might of course expose the violator to contempt proceedings, as with any other violation of a judicial order), is that the pension plan could not proceed against Stevens unless the bankruptcy judge lifted the stay. The demand would still be effective against nonbankrupt members of the controlled group, such as Slotky. So at least the cases hold, I.A.M. National Pension Fund v. Slyman Industries, Inc., 901 F.2d 127 (D.C.Cir.1990); McDonald v. Centra, Inc., 946 F.2d 1059, 1065 (4th Cir.1991), sensibly in our view, though there is a division of authority over whether in other settings a filing that violates the automatic stay can be given any legal effect. Pettibone Corp. v. Easley, 935 F.2d 120, 122 (7th Cir.1991).
