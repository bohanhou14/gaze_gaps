The reference cases provided, 557 F.3d 910, 664 F.3d 240, and 572 F.3d 455, all deal with legal cases involving supervised release and sentence revocation. In each case, the court's decision to revoke supervised release and impose a sentence was challenged by the defendant.

In the case of 557 F.3d 910, the defendant, Miller, argued that the district court erred in revoking his supervised release based on violations of Special Conditions 8 and 9. However, the court held that Miller did not raise any objection to the conditions of his supervised release at the time they were imposed or at any time prior to the filing of the petition for revocation, and therefore, his attempt to collaterally attack the validity of his underlying sentence was rejected.

Similarly, in the case of 664 F.3d 240, the defendant, Smith, argued that her sentence was substantively unreasonable and that the district court gave too much weight to the guidelines. However, the court held that Smith received a sentence within the applicable guideline range and that the district court considered the mitigating circumstances and other § 3553(a) factors.

In the case of 572 F.3d 455, the defendant, Feemster, argued that his sentence was substantively unreasonable and that the district court failed to consider all of the § 3553(a) factors. However, the court held that the district court correctly calculated the advisory Guidelines range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered all of the § 3553(a) factors, and adequately explained its reasoning for the sentence imposed.

In the present case, Goodon argues that the district court erred in revoking his supervised release and imposing a sentence. However, based on the facts presented, it appears that Goodon failed to notify his probation officer within 72 hours of contact with law enforcement officers, as required by a condition of his supervised release. The district court's decision to revoke his supervised release and impose a sentence was not an abuse of discretion.

In conclusion, the reference cases demonstrate that the courts will not tolerate attempts to collaterally attack the validity of a sentence or supervised release. Additionally, the courts will carefully consider all of the § 3553(a) factors when imposing a sentence, and will not hesitate to impose a sentence outside of the guidelines range if the circumstances warrant it.

gold_text: Goodon argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. We review the substantive reasonableness of a revocation sentence under the same abuse of discretion standard as initial sentencing decisions. United States v. Miller, 557 F.3d 910, 915-16 (8th Cir.2009). A district court commits an abuse of discretion when it “(1) fails to consider a relevant factor that should have received significant weight; (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor; or (3) considers only the appropriate factors but in weighing those factors commits a clear error of judgment.” United States v. Maxwell, 664 F.3d 240, 245 (8th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing United States v. Feemster, 572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc)). A sentence within the guideline range may be presumed to be reasonable. Feemster, 572 F.3d at 461.
