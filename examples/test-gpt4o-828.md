Plaintiffs’ argument that they have a right to educate their children in any manner they see fit does not find support in constitutional jurisprudence. The Supreme Court’s decision in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, recognized the state's authority to impose educational standards, and merely affirmed parents' right to choose private education as an alternative to public schooling. Likewise, in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, the Court emphasized the role of state lawmakers in determining educational policies and funding mechanisms, highlighting that constitutional challenges to education policy must meet a high threshold. 

Considering the precedent set by these cases, plaintiffs’ broad assertion of "personal or philosophical" choice for home education does not constitute a fundamental right warranting strict scrutiny. Thus, the Illinois Compulsory Attendance Act stands as a reasonable exercise of the state’s police power, aimed at ensuring all children receive an adequate education.

Accordingly, this court finds no substantial constitutional grounds in plaintiffs’ complaint to warrant either injunctive or declaratory relief. Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is therefore granted.

gold_text: In Count II, plaintiffs claim that the statute deprives them of equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment as applied to them, in that defendants distinguish between parents who educate their children in either a public or institutional private school, and those who, like plaintiffs, educate their children privately at home. It is true that defendants administratively presume that parents who educate their children at home are in violation of the statute. Plaintiffs do not assert, however, that this distinction operates to the peculiar disadvantage of any suspect class. Moreover, it should be clear, for the reasons stated above and in accord with the recent Supreme Court decision in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 29-39, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973), that the defendants’ actions do not interfere with the exercise of any “fundamental” right. In Rodriguez, the court held that education is not a constitutionally protected fundamental right, the impingement of which would necessitate subjecting the State’s action to strict judicial scrutiny. This court need therefore apply only the traditional standard of review, which “requires only that the State’s system be shown to bear some rational relationship to legitimate state purposes.” 411 U.S. at 40, 93 S.Ct. at 1300. It is clear that the State is empowered to reasonably “regulate all schools, to inspect, supervise and examine them, their teachers and pupils.” Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925). The distinction in treatment by the State between parents who send their children to institutional schools and those who educate them at home directly relates to the difficulty that the State would surely face in supervising, at considerable expense, a host of facilities and individuals, widely scattered, who might undertake to instruct their children at home; as compared with the less difficult and expensive supervision of teachers and facilities in organized public and private schools, moreover, the legislature might have concluded that institutional private schools are under the direct supervision of their school authorities at all times, and their students would thus presumptively qualify for the statutory exemption. People v. Turner, 121 Cal.App.2d Supp. 861, 263 P.2d 685 (1953), appeal dismissed, 347 U.S. 972, 74 S.Ct. 785, 98 L.Ed. 1112 (1954); State v. Hoyt, 84 N.H.38, 146 A. 170 (1929).
