The case involves a warrantless search of Fuller's backyard and statements he made following his arrest. Fuller argues that the police did not have probable cause to enter his backyard and that the search was not justified by exigent circumstances.

The court concludes that the police were engaged in a "hot pursuit" of a stolen-car suspect, and that the pursuit had not yet become "cold" when they entered Fuller's backyard. The court relies on the "hot pursuit" doctrine, which allows police to enter a private residence without a warrant in certain circumstances, such as when there is a danger of flight or escape.

The court also cites United States v. Santana, 427 U.S. 38 (1976), which held that a suspect may not defeat an arrest which has been set in motion in a public place, and is therefore proper under Watson, by the expedient of escaping to a private place. The court notes that the police were acting in a legitimate pursuit of a suspect, and that the entry into Fuller's backyard was necessary to prevent the suspect from escaping.

In addition, the court cites United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973), which held that a search incident to a lawful arrest is reasonable, even if it extends to areas outside the place of arrest. The court concludes that the police had probable cause to arrest Fuller and that the search of his backyard was justified by exigent circumstances.

In a similar vein, the court cites United States v. Jackson, 466 U.S. 740 (1984), which held that a warrantless search of a home is reasonable if it is incident to a lawful arrest and is necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence. The court concludes that the search of Fuller's backyard was necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence and that it was justified by exigent circumstances.

In conclusion, the court concludes that the police had probable cause to enter Fuller's backyard and that the search was justified by exigent circumstances. The court relies on the "hot pursuit" doctrine and cases such as United States v. Santana and United States v. Robinson to support its conclusion. The court also cites United States v. Jackson to justify the search of Fuller's backyard as necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence. <answer>
