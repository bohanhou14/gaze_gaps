The reference cases 958 F.2d 730 and 103 F.3d 490 provide valuable insights into the concept of fiduciary duties and the preemption of state law claims under ERISA. In the case of Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada v. Flacche, 958 F.2d 730 (6th Cir. 1988), the court held that Sun Life is not a fiduciary under ERISA's statutory definitions. The court also rejected the argument that Ohio common-law principles should be applied to define a fiduciary under ERISA.

Similarly, in the case of Central States, Pension Fund v. Feldman, 103 F.3d 490 (7th Cir. 1997), the court dismissed the plaintiff's claims under ERISA, holding that the claims were preempted by ERISA's broad preemption provisions. The court also noted that the plaintiff's claims were poorly disguised ERISA withdrawal liability claims, and that the action was driven entirely by the failure of an employer to pay its withdrawal liability to the plan.

In both cases, the courts emphasized the importance of ERISA's preemption provisions and the need to limit the involvement of state courts in the administration of employee benefit plans. The courts also highlighted the limited nature of federal common law and the need for courts to be cautious in creating new causes of action under federal common law.

In conclusion, the reference cases 958 F.2d 730 and 103 F.3d 490 demonstrate the importance of ERISA's preemption provisions and the need for courts to carefully consider the scope of federal common law. The cases also illustrate the importance of defining a fiduciary under ERISA and the need for courts to apply ERISA's statutory definitions in determining fiduciary duties.

gold_text: In Flacche v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, 958 F.2d 730, 735 (6th Cir.1992), this court addressed the intermingling of ERISA and federal common law claims. We held that federal common law should be created “only where the federal statute does not expressly address the issue before the court.” Id. Most recently, in Muse v. IBM, 103 F.3d 490 (6th Cir.1996), petition for cert. filed, 65 USLW 3666 (March 25, 1997) (No. 96-1520), we addressed a request by plaintiffs that their five common law claims (which had been dismissed by the district court on summary judgment) be reinstated “either as federal ERISA common law claims or as state common law claims.” Id. at 495. In regard to plaintiffs’ contention that even if their state law claims were preempted by ERISA, those claims could be “repackaged and saved” as federal common law claims, we noted, “federal common law is developed under ERISA only in those instances in which ERISA is silent or ambiguous.” . Id. We concluded that because the previously dismissed claims sought to recover for conduct that fell within the purview of specific provisions of ERISA, those claims could not “be reasserted as separate claims arising under federal common law.” Id.
