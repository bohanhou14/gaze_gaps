**Generation:**


We analyze the case of Nupur Patel, a lawful permanent resident who was convicted of conspiracy to commit larceny and was subsequently removed from the United States due to his conviction being considered a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) determined that Patel's conviction was a CIMT because he intended to permanently deprive the owners of their property, citing the prosecutor's description of the facts at the plea hearing.

However, Patel argues that the BIA's conclusion is flawed because the prosecutor's description does not establish that Patel intended to permanently deprive the owners of their property. He points to the phrase "for their own benefit" in the prosecutor's description, which he claims is similar to the language in the temporary-intent prong of the larceny statute. The Government counters that the word "steal" in the prosecutor's description suggests a permanent intent.

We agree with Patel that the prosecutor's description is ambiguous and cannot be used to determine Patel's intent. We also agree with the Second Circuit's decision in Wala v. Mukasey, 511 F.3d 102 (2d Cir.2007), which held that the record of conviction does not establish that the petitioner intended to permanently deprive the owners of their property. The Wala court noted that the petitioner's plea colloquy did not admit to taking the items with the intent to appropriate them permanently, and that the charging document did not specifically name the intended crime associated with the burglary conviction.

In conclusion, we reverse the BIA's decision and hold that Patel's conviction is not a CIMT. We agree with Patel that the prosecutor's description is ambiguous and cannot be used to determine his intent, and we follow the Second Circuit's decision in Wala v. Mukasey.

The Wala court’s bottom-line conclusion was that, “although it may have been reasonable for the BIA to infer that Wala intended permanently to keep the items he admitted taking, the modified categorical approach does not permit the BIA to draw inferences of this kind.” Id.; accord Akinsade v. Holder, 678 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir.2012); cf. Renteria-Morales v. Mukasey, 551 F.3d 1076, 1085 (9th Cir.2008) (inferences drawn from the record of conviction must be “necessary,” not merely “reasonable”).
