The Sixth Circuit in Tennessee Student Assistance Corp. v. Hornsby (In re Hornsby) has established that while complete discharge of student loans is generally not permissible, § 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code enables courts to fashion equitable remedies, including partial discharge, where necessary to prevent undue hardship (144 F.3d 433, 438-39 (6th Cir. 1998)). This Court concurs with such judicial discretion, contextualized by Fraley v. U.S. Dept. of Ed. (In re Fraley), which underscores that § 105(a) should be applied when the equities significantly favor the debtor (247 B.R. 417, 422 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2000)), and must be utilized based on particular case facts and appropriate precedent (254 B.R. 191).

In this case, considering Debtor’s age, insufficient current and anticipated income, demonstrated good faith in repaying the loans, and the financial strain imposed by the PLUS loan obligations, the equities strongly tilt in favor of the Debtor. Accordingly, while a full discharge is not warranted, it is equitable under § 105(a) to partially discharge the Debtor’s PLUS loan obligations to the extent they exceed a sustainable repayment ability, ensuring the Debtor does not suffer undue hardship.
