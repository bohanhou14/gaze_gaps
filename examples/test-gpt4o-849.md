We find this argument unpersuasive. As established in 33 T.C. 1, the demolition or removal of structures from a property, when undertaken in connection with the sale of that property, is considered a capital expenditure and not an ordinary expense. In that case, the demolition costs were treated as part of the sales costs, thereby increasing the basis of the property.

Similarly, in 12 T.C. 659, expenditures made to bring about improvements to property, even if indirectly beneficial, are classified as capital expenditures rather than deductible expenses. The case demonstrated that indirect improvements to property necessitate capitalization.

Applying these principles, the costs incurred by petitioners to move their former dwelling to premises C should be classified as a capital expenditure. This expenditure directly relates to the repositioning and subsequent conversion of the dwelling into income-producing rental property, thus increasing its value and basis.

Accordingly, respondent correctly determined that the moving expenses should be added to the basis of the dwelling rather than being offset against the amount realized on the sale of the land of premises A. Therefore, we uphold the respondent’s treatment of the moving expenses as capital expenditures.
