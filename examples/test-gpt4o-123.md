It is essential to recognize the impact of the Supreme Court decision in New Jersey v. Anderson, 203 U.S. 483 (1906), which clarified that state tax claims are treated as general creditors unless given higher priority by state laws (see Reference case 39 S. Ct. 186, 63 L. Ed. 543). According to the cited cases, section 67d of the Bankruptcy Act protects liens given or accepted in good faith. Moreover, section 64a establishes the order of payment, prioritizing taxes over dividends to general creditors. However, it does not elevate unsecured tax claims above valid lien holders.

In this case, the referee correctly interpreted these provisions by prioritizing wage claims per the 1926 amendment to section 64. This amendment was a direct response to Oliver v. United States, 268 U.S. 1 (1925), which initially gave federal and state taxes priority over wage claims. Congress explicitly subordinated tax payments to preferred wage claims in this amendment, demonstrating its legislative intent (see Reference case 39 S. Ct. 186, 63 L. Ed. 543).

Concluding, the referee's decision aligns with the statutory amendments and judicial precedent, appropriately subordinating the tax liens to the wage claims earned within three months of bankruptcy commencement. As such, the petition for review must be denied.

gold_text: In the case of City of Richmond v. Bird, 249 U. S. 174, 39 S. Ct. 186, 188, 63 L. Ed. 543, the Supreme Court, in construing these two sections of the Bankruptcy Act before the passage of the amendment of 1926, said: “Other provisions must, of course, be construed in view of this positive one.” At that, time section 67d was “the positive one”; but since the amendment of 1926 to section 64 makes no distinction between taxes which have become liens and those which have not, section 64 is now the “positive one” and section 67d must be construed in view of section 64 as it now stands.
