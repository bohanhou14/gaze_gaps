**Generation:**

Highwoods contends that the terms "related" and "series" are ambiguous, as the court found with similar terms in McCuen v. American Cas. Co., 946 F.2d 1401, 1408 (8th Cir.1991). However, the precedent in Gregory v. Home Ins. Company, 876 F.2d 602 (7th Cir.1989) clarifies that the word “related” covers a broad range of connections, both causal and logical. This understanding is further supported by 205 F.3d 1258, which emphasizes that “related” encompasses both logical and causal connections. Applying these definitions, the court concluded that the factual nexus between Wright and Flake, despite their distinct legal theories and remedies sought, was sufficiently intertwined through the merger's overarching context to deem them related claims under the policy's language. Therefore, there is no ambiguity as Highwoods suggests, and the district court's interpretation aligning with Gregory's reasoning remains valid, affirming the applicability of the related claims provision.

gold_text: We believe that the contextualized approach of the Seventh Circuit in Gregory v. Home Ins. Co., 876 F.2d 602 (7th Cir.1989), is appropriate and consistent with our prior holdings. Gregory held that the term “related” had a common meaning sufficiently clear to be applied to the particular facts at issue. Noting that the meaning of “related” “covers a very broad range of connections, both causal and logical,” Gregory still found that the facts of the case “comfortably fit within” the term’s natural scope. Id. at 606; see also Continental Cas. Co. v. Wendt, 205 F.3d 1258, 1263-64 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (adopting opinion in Continental Cos. Co. v. Hall, No. 97-323-CIV-OC-10B (M.D.Fla.1999), which used the dictionary definition of “related” and found that certain wrongful acts, although involving various types of acts that produced different harms, were clearly related because they were “aimed at a single particular goal,” and constituted “a single course of conduct”). We will not automatically conclude that such broad terms are necessarily ambiguous and will not always construe them in favor of the insured. See Gregory, 876 F.2d at 606. We conclude that a term should be found unambiguous if the facts of the case “comfortably fit within the commonly accepted definition of the concept,” but may be ambiguous if the facts fall on the margins of a broad reading. See id. The facts of McCuen were close to the margins; this case is not.
