**Generation:**

In reaching our conclusion, we find guidance in Cooper’s interpretation of the law and our prior decisions regarding the scope of liquidated damages (see 894 F.2d 1150). Consistent with the precedent established in Thurston, the jury's instructions and the evidentiary standards applied herein align with our case-by-case approach.

Further, we observe that Amtrak’s assertions regarding the exclusion of evidence and arguments have not been demonstrated to have been raised at the district court level, rendering them procedurally inadequately preserved for appeal (see 10th Cir.R, 28.2(d)). This procedural principle is supported by similar rulings, such as in the K Mart case (see 69 F.3d 1475), underscoring the necessity of raising all relevant arguments at the trial court level to be duly considered on appeal.

Thus, we find no merit in Amtrak’s contentions on these grounds and reaffirm our commitment to ensuring all pertinent facts and legal standards are judiciously applied. This further solidifies our decision to reverse and remand for a new trial based on the cumulative evidence of a continuing violation.

gold_text: In light of our ruling, we need not specifically rule on the evidentiary issues raised by Morgan; however, because these issues may arise again on retrial, we voice a general comment. We note that one of the main issues in a hostile environment or discrimination case is the pervasiveness of the conduct at issue. In this case, the district court excluded significant pieces of information regarding such environment, specifically, portions of Morgan and Fontaine’s testimony and the whole of George’s testimony. This evidence went to the overall environment of the Yard. ' This court has previously recognized that an employer’s conduct tending to demonstrate its general hostility towards a group is both relevant and admissible. See Heyne v. Caruso, 69 F.3d 1475, 1479 (9th Cir.1995). See also Spulak v. K Mart Corp., 894 F.2d 1150, 1156 (10th Cir.1990) (noting that “[a]s a general rule, the testimony of other employees about their treatment by the defendant [employer] is relevant to the issue of the employer’s discriminatory intent.”) We further note that, in returning the verdict, the jury expressed concern about the overall environment at the Yard. The jury commented:
