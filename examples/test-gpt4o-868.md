In analyzing the Bruton error claim, we refer to the precedent established in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), where the Supreme Court determined that the admission of a nontestifying codefendant’s confession implicating the defendant violates the defendant’s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights. This principle was reinforced and found retroactive in Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293 (1968), thus applying it retrospectively to cases tried prior to Bruton.

However, the context in which a Bruton violation mandates reversal was evaluated in Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250 (1969). The Court held that if the evidence of guilt is overwhelming and the prejudicial effect of the codefendant’s statement is insignificant by comparison, the Bruton error may be considered harmless. Specifically, the Harrington Court noted that even substantial constitutional violations should not automatically overturn a conviction if the error is deemed harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

In the present case, while Nash argues that the statements made by his codefendant Kinchion were facially incriminatory and thus violated Bruton, as in Harrington (395 U.S. 250), the analysis must consider whether these statements had a prejudicial impact or if the evidence of Nash’s guilt independently stands strong. Given the extensive surveillance, detailed recordings, and other substantial evidence presented, it is arguable that any Bruton error here may be deemed harmless.

Previous cases, such as Harrington (395 U.S. 250), highlighted that even infringing constitutional procedures, if the evidence overwhelmingly supports guilt and any error is inconsequential, do not necessitate automatic reversal. Thus, based on this precedent, any Bruton error in Nash’s trial, considering the robust evidence, could reasonably be seen as harmless in nature.

Florida, 405 U.S. 427, 430, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 31 L.Ed.2d 340 (1972). Reversal is unnecessary if “we can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the constitutional error was harmless.” Sarracino, 340 F.3d at 1160. The test for determining whether the error was harmless is “whether the jury would have returned the same verdict absent the error.” Washington v. Recuenco, — U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2546, 2552, 165 L.Ed.2d 466 (2006). In applying this standard, we review the record de novo, and our judgment is informed by the context in which the Bruton statement was admitted, how it was used at trial, and how it compares to the properly admitted evidence. Sarracino, 340 F.3d at 1160. “ ‘Our judgment must be based on our own reading of the record and on what seems to us to have been the probable impact of the ... confession ] on the minds of an average jury.’ ” Id. (quoting Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 254, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969)).
