In assessing the preclusion principles under Kentucky law, two key reference cases provide pertinent insights. First, referring to 383 F.2d 358, where the District Court granted summary judgment, we observe that the court recognized the finality principle in dismissals with prejudice. This reinforces that state court decisions can significantly influence subsequent federal litigation.

Additionally, in the case cited as 753 F.2d 50, the Circuit Court of Jefferson County addressed preclusion when it found that the Georges’ counterclaims involving identical legal issues had been resolved in prior state court proceedings. The District Court thus dismissed their federal complaint, affirming the importance of precluding litigated defenses in subsequent actions.

Given these precedents, it is evident that Kentucky’s courts uphold a stringent standard for issue preclusion, barring re-litigation of issues that were conclusively resolved in prior state actions. As applied here, while Wicker’s federal claims, particularly regarding political discrimination, were reserved, factual determinations already adjudicated by Kentucky courts under state statutes, such as Wicker’s mishandling of financial affairs, should be precluded from re-litigation in federal court.

Thus, while Wicker’s federal issues warrant consideration by the federal court, those elements fully litigated and decided by Kentucky courts, where he had a full and fair opportunity to contest, are bound by preclusion principles as established in Kentucky jurisprudence and reinforced by the cited federal cases.

United Kentucky Bank, Inc., 753 F.2d 50, 53 (6th Cir.1985) (interpreting Kentucky law). Applying that standard, it is clear that the state courts here neither actually nor necessarily determined whether the Board was motivated by political bias.
