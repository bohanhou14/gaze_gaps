In determining whether Griffith’s consent to search was tainted by the unlawful arrest, we are guided by precedents that discuss the voluntariness of consent acquired during such circumstances. Specifically, in *United States v. Guimond* (344 F.3d 623), the court emphasized that consent to search can be valid if it is voluntary and not a result of coercion, even when granted during an illegal seizure. However, this principle must be balanced against the Supreme Court ruling in *Brown v. Illinois*, 422 U.S. 590, which mandates that evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful arrest be excluded to deter illegal seizures, regardless of the voluntariness of the consent.

Analyzing Griffith's situation under these frameworks, the district court must assess whether Griffith's consent to search his house was genuinely voluntary or tainted by the illegal arrest. Given the circumstances—Griffith was lured to his home under false pretenses, arrested without probable cause, and only then asked for consent while still detained—it is likely that the consent was not a product of free will, but rather influenced by the improper arrest. 

Moreover, *Wong Sun v. United States* (371 U.S. 471) reinforces the exclusionary rule, which excludes not only the direct fruits of an illegal action but also evidence derived from it. Hence, the search revealed the firearm and drugs in Griffith's home as fruits of his unlawful arrest, should be subjected to suppression. On remand, the district court must reconsider the suppression of evidence considering the conclusions drawn here.

Therefore, we reverse the district court’s denial of Griffith's suppression motion and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, in line with the guiding principles from *Wong Sun* and *Brown*.

gold_text: Arguing that his arrest was illegal, however, does not immediately entitle Griffith to suppression of the gun and drugs, because they were found in a search conducted pursuant to his consent. In order to be entitled to suppression, he must also demonstrate that the search, although consensual, was nonetheless the ‘fruit’ of the allegedly-illegal arrest within the meaning of Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). United States v. Lopez-Arias, 344 F.3d 623, 629 (6th Cir.2003), stated the relevant rule:
