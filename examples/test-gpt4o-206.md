Claim Against Lewis and Clark County

Kane asserts that Lewis and Clark County should be held liable under § 1983 for unlawfully causing her arrest. To establish municipal liability, Kane must show that the County, through its policymakers, caused a constitutional violation (520 U.S. 397). The relevant inquiry is whether the action constituted a policy or a custom of the County (907 F.2d 879). The fact that the County Attorney reviewed and approved Whitcomb’s affidavit, leading to a judicial warrant, suggests procedural adherence rather than a policy aimed at violating rights.

The County contends that Kane abandoned her claims against it, citing her Proposed Pre-trial Order dated March 30, 1992. However, an examination of the document reveals that Kane did not abandon these claims; she vigorously pursued them contrary to the County's assertion (76 F.3d 1032).

To hold the County liable, Kane must demonstrate that the County's deliberate actions were the "moving force" behind her arrest (520 U.S. 397). Evidence in Whitcomb's affidavit and the subsequent legal steps indicate due process rather than intentional deprivation of rights endorsed by the County.

Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to establish municipal liability as required under § 1983 against Lewis and Clark County for causing an unlawful arrest.

gold_text: Kane’s argument against the County is based entirely on County Attorney McGrath’s assistance to Whitcomb in preparing a complaint to be used in obtaining an arrest warrant. At the hearing in the district court Kane’s counsel stated that he is aware of no County policy under which McGrath acted. The court added that the record revealed none. To state a claim against a county, a plaintiff must allege and establish that a county policy, practice, or custom caused the violation of the plaintiffs constitutional right. Pierce v. Multnomah County, 76 F.3d 1032, 1039 (9th Cir.1996). There is no vicarious or respondent superior liability under § 1983. Los Angeles Police Protective League v. Gates, 907 F.2d 879, 889 (9th Cir.1990). There is also no showing that McGrath, with the single act of preparing the complaint for Whitcomb to sign, even if acting as a policy maker for the county, acted with deliberate indifference as required by Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 407, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997).
