The case before us involves a dispute over the priority of claims between Mid-American Travel Service, Inc. (Mid-American) and First National Bank of Eastern Arkansas (FNBEA). FNBEA claims a priority status on $86,000.00 of its claim, which was based on credit card deposits to Mid-American's account. The debtor, Mid-American, objects to FNBEA's claim of priority, arguing that FNBEA's claim is based on subrogation rights it acquired when credit card holders "reversed" credit card charges for services the debtor did not perform, and therefore, 11 U.S.C. § 507(d) bars FNBEA's claim of priority.

The court notes that the issue is whether FNBEA's claim should be treated as a priority claim under 11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(6) or as a general unsecured claim because of 11 U.S.C. § 507(d). The court also references the case of In re Bugos, 760 F.2d 731, 733 (7th Cir.1984), which states that subrogation arises when a party having a liability pays a debt of a party who is liable on a debt and who, in equity, should pay. 

The court also references the case of In re Russell, 101 B.R. 62, 64 (Bankr.W.D.Ark.1989), which states that subrogation entitles the party paying the debt to exercise all rights and remedies that the creditor possessed against the party who should have paid the debt.

In this case, FNBEA's liability to the credit card holders was pursuant to law, specifically 15 U.S.C. § 1666(b) and 12 CFR § 226.13(e). The court holds that FNBEA's claims arise from subrogation, not assignment, and therefore, 11 U.S.C. § 507(d) bars FNBEA's claim of priority.

The court concludes that FNBEA's claim should be treated as a general unsecured claim, not as a priority claim under 11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(6). The court's decision is based on the principles of subrogation, which entitle the party paying the debt to exercise all rights and remedies that the creditor possessed against the party who should have paid the debt.

gold_text: First, FNBEA argues that it is an assign-ee pursuant to the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in the case of Wilson v. Brooks Supermarket, Inc. (In re Missionary Baptist Found. of America, Inc.), 667 F.2d 1244, 1246 (5th Cir.1982). The Fifth Circuit case involved a claimant who voluntarily cashed payroll checks for employees of a debtor without any liability to do so. The court found that the claimant was not a subrogee, but an assignee of the employees and, therefore, 11 U.S.C. § 507(d) did not bar the claim of priority. Wilson v. Brooks Supermarket, Inc. (In re Missionary Baptist Foundation of America, Inc.), 667 F.2d 1244 (5th Cir.1982), citing In re Stultz Bros., 226 F. 989 (S.D.N.Y.1915). The facts in the instant case are distinguishable because FNBEA did not act voluntarily when it “reversed” the credit card holders’ charges, but was required by law to credit the accounts in the amounts of the disputed claims. Since FNBEA’s actions were required by law, its claim arises from subrogation rather than assignment.
