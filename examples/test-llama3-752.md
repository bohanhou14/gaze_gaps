The reference case 880 F.2d 1540 is a key precedent in determining the priority of tax claims in bankruptcy proceedings. In this case, the court held that the automatic stay prohibits the creation of a local tax lien upon real property unless the county has a prepetition interest in the real property. The court also held that the county obtains an interest in the real property as of the "tax status date" and is entitled to a priority for postpetition interest on valid tax liens.

In the present case, the reassessed real property taxes at issue are rooted in and relate primarily to prepetition tax periods. However, the supplemental and adjusted tax statements were issued subsequent to the petition date, at which time they became obligations of the Debtor under the Lease. Therefore, the court must determine whether the obligations to pay the reassessed taxes constitute prepetition or postpetition claims of the debtor within the meaning of section 101(5) of the Code.

Citing the reference case 880 F.2d 1540, the court must treat the obligations to pay the reassessed taxes as postpetition claims of the debtor. This is because the court must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. Therefore, the court grants MaceRich's motion and requires the Debtor to pay the reassessed taxes as lease obligations arising after the order for relief.

In conclusion, the court's decision is consistent with the reference case 880 F.2d 1540 and the Code's broad definition of the term "claim". The court's decision also acknowledges the importance of treating tax claims as postpetition claims of the debtor, as this is the only way to ensure that the Debtor's obligations are timely performed.
