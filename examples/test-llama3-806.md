In the context of the two reference cases, 774 F.2d 338 and 856 F.2d 1120, it is evident that the district court's determination in the present case is reasonable. As stated in Hill v. Blackwell, 774 F.2d 338, the prison officials' expert judgment in matters of prison administration must be given deference, and the responsible officials need only show that the exercise of the challenged religious belief could create a potential threat to a legitimate penological objective. In this case, the prison officials have demonstrated that the exercise of the prisoner's religious belief could create a potential threat to the security and order of the prison.

Furthermore, the Supreme Court's decision in Turner v. Safley, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), provides guidance on the balancing of prisoners' rights with prison rules. The Court articulated the "reasonable relationship" standard, which requires that the regulation be reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest and that alternative means of exercising the prisoner's rights remain available. In this case, the prison officials have established a legitimate penological interest in maintaining security and order in the prison, and alternative means of exercising the prisoner's religious belief are available.

In conclusion, the district court's determination in the present case is reasonable and in accordance with the principles established in the reference cases. The prison officials' expert judgment in matters of prison administration must be given deference, and the prisoners' rights must be balanced with the legitimate penological interests of the prison. The court's decision is supported by the "reasonable relationship" standard established in Turner v. Safley and is consistent with the principles of deference to prison officials established in Hill v. Blackwell.

While, in evaluating a district court’s determinations concerning the reasonableness of prison regulations that impinge on constitutional rights this court’s review of the ultimate legal conclusion is plenary, Hill v. Blackwell, 774 F.2d 338, 343 (8th Cir.1985), it is important that our decision be limited to relevant facts. Moreover, “we are keenly aware ... that federal courts owe great deference to the expertise of the officials who perform the always difficult and often thankless task of running a prison.” Salaam v.
