In the case of Edenfield v. Tattnall County School District, the court addressed the issue of whether the use of the California Achievement Test (CAT) as an exit examination in the Tattnall County School District violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the school authorities had not met their burden of proof in demonstrating that the CAT was a fair test of the material actually taught in the curriculum.

The court referenced the Debra P. v. Turlington case (644 F.2d 397, 1977), in which the Fifth Circuit held that the burden of proof was on the school authorities to demonstrate that the test was a fair test of what was taught. The court noted that the Debra P. case provided little guidance on what constitutes a "fair test," but it did establish that the burden of proof was on the school authorities.

The court also referenced the case of Goss v. Lopez (435 U.S. 78, 1974), in which the Supreme Court held that students have a right to due process before being suspended or expelled from school. The court noted that the severity of the deprivation was only one of several factors that must be weighed in deciding the exact due process owed to students.

In this case, the court found that the school authorities had not met their burden of proof in demonstrating that the CAT was a fair test of the material actually taught in the curriculum. The court noted that the curriculum match analysis performed by the school authorities was insufficient because it failed to take into account other important aspects of the test questions, such as readability, passage type, and question complexity.

The court also found that the statistical evidence presented by the plaintiffs was not persuasive, and that the students who made the largest gains in their CAT scores were the students who scored at the lowest levels on entry to high school. The court concluded that the use of the CAT as an exit examination in the Tattnall County School District did not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

In conclusion, the court held that the school authorities had not met their burden of proof in demonstrating that the CAT was a fair test of the material actually taught in the curriculum, and that the use of the CAT as an exit examination in the Tattnall County School District did not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

gold_text: Previous to the decision in Debra P., the Court is unaware of any judicial decision which placed the burden on the school authorities to prove that their academic evaluative decisions were not violative of substantive due process. In the area of procedural due process courts have been careful to distinguish academic as opposed to disciplinary dismissals. Board of Curators, University of Missouri v. Horowitz, 435 U.S. 78, 98 S.Ct. 948, 55 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977); Mahavongsanan v. Hall, 529 F.2d 448 (5th Cir. 1976); Gaspar v. Bruton, 513 F.2d 843 (10th Cir. 1975). This reluctance on the part of the courts to review academic dismissals is based on the courts’ lack of expertise in evaluating academic decisions. In Horowitz, the Supreme Court remarked, “Courts are particularly ill-equipped to evaluate academic performance. The factors discussed in Part II with respect to procedural due process speak a fortiori here and warn against any such judicial intrusion into academic decision-making.” Horowitz, supra, at 92.
