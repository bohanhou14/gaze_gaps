OPINION AND ORDER

The primary question in this case is whether the two severance plans in question constitute ERISA plans. After conducting a thorough analysis and considering the relevant case law, including Fort Halifax Packing Co., Inc. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987), Belanger, et al. v. Wyman-Gordan Co., 71 F.3d 451, 454 (1st Cir.1995), and Gilmore v. Silgan Plastics, 917 F.Supp. 685 (E.D.Mo.1996), I conclude that neither plan meets the requirements for an ERISA plan.

The original plan, which was inherited by RHI, did not create an administrative burden substantial enough to invoke ERISA status. The plan was based on a simple, arithmetical application of a salary table, and did not require any ongoing administrative activity. Similarly, the new plan, which was amended by RHI, does not meet the requirements for an ERISA plan. The plan relied on the discretion of management to determine eligibility and calculation, and did not provide any explicit eligibility standards or distribution mechanisms.

In Fort Halifax, the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of administrative integrity in determining whether a plan is an ERISA plan. The Court stated that a plan must require some type of administrative activity to be implemented. 482 U.S. at 16, 107 S.Ct. 2211. In this case, neither plan meets this requirement, as they do not require any ongoing administrative activity.

Furthermore, the First Circuit has stated that ERISA is not implicated where the administrator of a plan was authorized in his discretion to exclude all employees who had been terminated “for any reason or no reason at all.” Rodowicz v. Mass. Mutual Life, 192 F.3d 162, 171 (1st Cir.1999). Similarly, in this case, the plans do not require the exercise of discretion to the degree that would justify saddling an employer with fiduciary responsibility and foreclosing an employee’s state claims.

In conclusion, based on the analysis above, I conclude that neither plan constitutes an ERISA plan. The plans do not create an administrative burden substantial enough to invoke ERISA status,

gold_text: This Court concludes that both severance plans in question are not ERISA plans. Therefore, defendant’s motion for summary judgement on plaintiffs ERISA claim (Count III) is granted. The only claims remaining (Count I and II) are for breach of contract implicating state law only. This Court could consider and decide the plaintiffs state law claims only under the supplemental jurisdiction doctrine. The applicable statute states that “in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action ... that they form part of the same case or controversy.” 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a) (1994). However, the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction is discretionary. The Lares Group, II v. Tobin, 47 F.Supp.2d 223, 235 (D.R.I. 1999), aff'd by, Lares Group, II v. Tobin, 221 F.3d 41 (1st Cir.2000). In making its decision the Court should “take into account concerns of comity, judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and the like.” Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 257 (1st Cir.1996). In the past, this Court has been mindful of the concerns of federalism and cautious of wasting federal judicial resources, declining the opportunity to interpret state law in matters devoid of any federal interest. Lares Group II, 47 F.Supp.2d at 235. Plaintiffs breach of contract claims relating to the company stock options and severance pay implicate Rhode Island law and should be decided by the Rhode Island Court where plaintiff originally brought this action.
