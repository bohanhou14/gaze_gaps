**Generation:**

In line with precedent, plaintiffs’ allegations regarding Salmons’ conduct do not meet the threshold for actionable sexual harassment under Title VII. As established in Scott v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 798 F.2d 210 (7th Cir. 1986), relatively isolated incidents, including lewd comments and minimal physical contact, do not constitute severe or pervasive harassment. Similarly, in Weiss v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 990 F.2d 333, the court found that propositions, touching, and attempts to kiss were insufficient to create a hostile work environment. 

Moreover, the court in Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, emphasized that conduct must significantly affect employment conditions to be actionable (referenced in 92 F.3d 473). The incidents Lindblom experienced, such as staring, infrequent touches on her knee and shoulder, and questioning about her weekends, do not rise to this level. Therefore, considering these factors, Salmons' actions do not constitute the severe or pervasive behavior required to establish a hostile work environment under Title VII. 

Accordingly, defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the sexual harassment claim is granted. 

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to the sexual harassment and retaliation claims is granted. Defendants' motion is, however, denied regarding the defamation claims.

gold_text: Similarly, in Weiss v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 990 F.2d 333, 337 (7th Cir.1993), the plaintiff complained of a hostile work environment caused by an overly amorous supervisor. On numerous occasions, the supervisor asked her for dates, called her a dumb blond, and put his hand on her shoulder. He attempted to kiss the plaintiff at a bar, and, on two occasions, he tried to kiss her in her office. The supervisor even placed an “I love you” sign in her work area. The Seventh Circuit held that these incidents did not amount to actionable sexual harassment because they were not sufficiently pervasive and severe from an objective perspective. Id. at 337. See also McKenzie v. Illinois Dept. of Transportation, 92 F.3d 473, 479-80 (7th Cir.1996) (holding that three sexually suggestive and offensive comments over a three-month period did not unreasonably interfere with the work environment from an objective perspective).
