**Generation:**

Plaintiff's situation parallels the referenced cases in the necessity and procedural adherence to filing claims under federal regulations. In this case, the failure to file a claim with the appropriate federal agency is jurisdictionally fatal. As held in **449 F.2d 124**, where the claim was improperly filed only with state officials rather than the federal entity, such oversight does not satisfy the requirements of 28 U.S.C. ยง 2675(a). Similarly, Plaintiff's contention that his appeal to the MSPB sufficed as notice of a tort claim is untenable. Furthermore, **454 F.2d 72** reinforces that individuals acting in official capacity for a federal agency are deemed federal employees for purposes of the Tort Claims Act. Plaintiff's assertion that MSPB should have forwarded his claim is unsupported by the strict statutory prerequisites, necessitating direct administrative filing. Consequently, the court finds no jurisdiction for the district court and upholds dismissal based on procedural non-compliance, affirming that tort claims must be administratively exhausted before judicial relief.
