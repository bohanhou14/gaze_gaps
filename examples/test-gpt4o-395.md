The plaintiffs further argue that their reliance on the Wolf Documents constitutes a protected property interest under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. However, courts have generally held that a mere expectation of a benefit or a state-created entitlement does not constitute a protected property interest unless it is guaranteed by law. In Greene v. Barrett, the court emphasized that an individual must prove both a protected property interest and inadequate procedural protections to claim a due process violation (195 F.3d 1190). 

In similar contexts, the Supreme Court has held that an entitlement to benefits requires compliance with certain statutory conditions. As seen in Mathews v. Eldridge, due process was only implicated once statutory entitlement was established and conditioned upon continuous receipt of such benefits (526 U.S. 40). The plaintiffs have not demonstrated that their reliance on the Wolf Documents met statutory conditions or created a guaranteed entitlement.

Additionally, the court in the referenced cases has consistently ruled that procedural errors in the implementation of state regulations do not equate to federal due process violations. Plaintiffs' claims of misrepresentation and procedural failures, as outlined earlier, do not rise to the level required to establish a substantive due process violation. Thus, their remaining claims must fail. Consequently, we affirm the district court's judgments.

We find no merit in any additional claims that might be raised by potential class members, as the underlying due process arguments have been sufficiently addressed and found lacking. As such, the matter of class certification or standing does not require further review, consistent with precedents set in cases such as Wiesmueller v. Kosobucki (506 F.3d 962).

gold_text: . Federal Lands Legal Consortium v. United States, 195 F.3d 1190, 1195 (10th Cir. 1999), suggested that American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 59, 119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999), requires us always to address the existence of a protected property interest when considering a due-process claim. "We are bound by the precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration of a superseding contrary decision by the Supreme Court.” United States v. Killion, 7 F.3d 927, 930 (10th Cir. 1993). But there is now contrary Supreme Court authority. See City of Cuyahoga Falls v. Buckeye Cmty. Hope Found., 538 U.S. 188, 198, 123 S.Ct. 1389, 155 L.Ed.2d 349 (2003) (declining to decide whether respondents possessed a property interest in building permits because their substantive-due-process claim would fail anyway). Therefore, neither Federal Lands nor Nichols v. Board of Cty. Comm’rs, 506 F.3d 962, 969 n.2 (10th Cir. 2007), which relied on Federal Lands without discussing City of Cuy-ahoga Falls, remains binding on this point.
