It is necessary to scrutinize whether the presiding judge provided adequate and correct guidance to the jury on the specifics of the statute and the defendant’s required intent. As elucidated in the reference case 57 L. Ed. 528, the court highlighted that the statute intended to encompass acts that could eventually lead to sexual immorality, asserting that the statute’s scope was broad enough to cover actions leading to debauchery or immoral practices. However, the court also balanced the interpretation to ensure the evidence directly correlated with the accused's conduct.

Moreover, in reference case 58 L. Ed. 728, it was determined that the offense of transporting a woman or girl for immoral purposes is consummate once the transportation occurred as a result of criminal acts laid out in the statute. It emphasized that post-transportation locus of repentance was not tenable once the journey was concluded and the purpose fulfilled.

Applying these principles, the instruction given was overly broad, possibly leading the jury to convict based on a perceived intent rather than explicit persuasive actions or inducements by the defendant as required under the White Slave Traffic Act. The jury should have been clearly instructed that conviction required evidence that the defendant’s conduct actively influenced Mary Forbes' decision to return to McMechen for immoral purposes, and not solely based on any potential or secretive intentions of the defendant.

gold_text: In further support of this conclusion it may be pointed out that the instruction here considered, as it appears to have been understood and followed by the jury, gives to the statute a scope and meaning which has not been indicated or foreshadowed in any previous decision. We have endeavored to examine with care every reported case under this act, but are unable to find any ruling or intimation which sustains this verdict of conviction. In all those cases there was not only clear evidence of persuasion and enticement, but in every instance the destination of the person enticed was a place and environment which implied a purpose to engage in immoral practices. Thus, in the Athanasaw Case, 227 U. S. 326, 33 Sup. Ct. 285, 57 L. Ed. 528, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 911, the destination was a low-class theater, where the surroundings and associations were such'as to furnish potent and almost irresistible temptation to a life of dishonor; in the Wilson Case, 232 U. S. 563, 34 Sup. Ct. 347, 58 L. Ed. 728, the destination was a notorious house of ill fame. In the case at bar there is nothing but speculation and conjecture upon which to rest a finding of that persuasion which the act denounces, while the interstate journey was to the girl’s own home, a home of unquestioned respectability, in which she had lived for years and in which she continued to live for nearly or quite a year after-wards, with all the outward appearance of innocence and virtue.
