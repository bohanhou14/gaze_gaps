This case involves a dispute over a proof of claim filed by Green Tree Servicing LLC in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. The bankruptcy court denied Green Tree's motion to expunge the proof of claim, which was filed by the debtor, Dennis and Sheila Wilson, on behalf of Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (SPS). Green Tree argues that the proof of claim is invalid because it was filed late and does not meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 3001.

In support of its argument, Green Tree cites case law, including United States v. Jones, 286 B.R. 612, which held that a late-filed proof of claim is not automatically allowed. Green Tree also cites In re Frascatore, 259 B.R. 580, which held that a claimant must introduce evidence into the record to support its claim.

However, the bankruptcy court found that the proof of claim was valid because it was filed in accordance with Rule 3004, which allows a debtor to file a proof of claim on behalf of a creditor who has not filed one. The court also found that SPS had standing as a creditor because it had provided documentation showing that it was the servicer of the senior mortgage.

Green Tree also argues that the proof of claim is invalid because it does not include an attachment showing the interest, fees, and charges included in the claim. However, the bankruptcy court found that this defect was cured by a subsequent amendment to the proof of claim, which included the required attachment.

In conclusion, the bankruptcy court's decision to deny Green Tree's motion to expunge the proof of claim was correct. The proof of claim was validly filed in accordance with Rule 3004, and SPS had standing as a creditor. Green Tree's arguments that the proof of claim is invalid are unfounded and lack merit.

gold_text: . Green Tree cites two cases for its position that a creditor cannot amend a debtor's claim, but they do not stand for that proposition. In In re Hill, 286 B.R. 612, 620-21 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.2002), the bankruptcy court rejected the creditor’s late-filed claim because the creditor “did not indicate anywhere on its Proof of Claim that it was an amendment to the Debtor's Proof of Claim or even that Debt- or had previously filed a proof of claim relating to its claim,” or otherwise indicate that it intended to amend the debtor's proof of claim. Such is not the case here, where SPS clearly signified its intention that 18-3 amend 18-2 by checking the amendment box on the copy of Form 10B submitted with 18-3 and by stating in its June 9, 2014 letter that it planned to file "an amendment to said Proof of Claim to reflect the actual amounts due and owing on the subject mortgage,” (see Proof of Claim 18-2 Pt. 3). In In re Kelley, 259 B.R. 580, 585 (Bankr.E.D.Tex.2001), the bankruptcy court recognized that it "could, pursuant to its equitable power recognized in In re Kolstad, [928 F.2d 171,] construe [the creditor’s] late claim as 'amending' rather than 'superseding' the claim filed on its behalf by the Debtor,” but declined to do so where the creditor "failed to establish any facts which would warrant the exercise of this Court’s equitable power in such a manner.”
