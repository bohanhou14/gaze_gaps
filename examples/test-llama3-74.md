The cases referenced in the articles provide guidance on the application of sentencing guidelines, particularly with regards to enhancements for abuse of trust and vulnerability. In the case of U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, an enhancement is permitted if the defendant occupied a position of trust and abused that position to facilitate the commission or concealment of the offense. Reference case 4 F.3d 925 supports this interpretation, stating that an abuse of trust is only appropriate if the defendant occupied a position of trust, abused that position, and the abuse is not included in the base level offense or specific offense characteristics.

In the instant case, the defendant, Mr. Brunson, did not occupy a position of trust vis-a-vis the Russian Coal Company, and therefore, the application of this enhancement is clearly erroneous. This is in line with the reasoning in Reference case 5 F.3d 467, which states that an enhancement for abuse of trust is only appropriate if the defendant occupied a position of trust and abused that position to facilitate the commission or concealment of the offense.

Additionally, the district court erred in applying the two-point sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1, which provides for an enhancement if the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or that a victim was otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct. The court's finding that the Russian Coal Company was vulnerable due to a language barrier and inexperience with a free market economy is insufficient to support a finding of special vulnerability.

In conclusion, the district court's application of the enhancements under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 and U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1 is erroneous, and the case must be remanded for resentencing. The court's findings were not supported by the evidence, and the enhancements were applied incorrectly. The court's application of these enhancements was also not in line with the reasoning in the referenced cases, which provide guidance on the application of these sentencing guidelines.

gold_text: As the application note to § 3B1.3 indicates, the other type of case where an enhancement under § 3B1.3 is proper is where a fiduciary or personal trust relationship exists. For example, in United States v. Queen, 4 F.3d 925 (10th Cir.1993), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 114 S.Ct. 1230, 127 L.Ed.2d 575 (1994), we upheld an enhancement for the president of a company who had claimed to be an investment advisor/broker and had solicited funds which he had diverted for his personal use. He covered up his diversion by sending phony profit statements to the investors. Clearly, his position provided him with “the freedom to commit a difficult-to-detect wrong,” one of the essential factors in the test for abuse of trust. United States v. Williams, 966 F.2d at 557. Furthermore, the district court had specifically found that a fiduciary relationship existed between the defendant and his “clients.” Id. at 927. Similarly, in United States v. Lowder, 5 F.3d 467 (10th Cir.1993), an accountant personally solicited investments from his tax clients, fraudulently promising them a guaranteed twelve percent return; the funds he then diverted to his personal use. As president of the company, he was able to dispose of the investors’ money without oversight. These cases are closer to the ease at bar in that they involve presidents of companies who defrauded others. Despite this similarity, these cases do not support an “abuse of trust” enhancement for Mr. Brunson.
