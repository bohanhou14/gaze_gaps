The doctrine of subject-matter waiver is particularly relevant here. According to the Tenth Circuit, a waiver concerning specific privileged communications invokes a waiver over all other communications on the same subject. This rule is to prevent selective disclosure and maintain fairness in the litigation process. In re Sealed Case, 676 F.2d 793, 809 n.54 (D.C. Cir. 1982) emphasizes that such waiver should be narrowly construed and only applied when partial waiver provides a tactical advantage.

Furthermore, United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, establishes that the use of privileged material for testimonial purposes operates as a waiver of privilege concerning the subject matter of the testimony. This principle underscores that utilizing privileged materials as both a sword and a shield is incompatible with judicial fairness. Similarly, the court in 247 B.R. 828 asserts that disclosure of work product should not necessarily unveil all related materials unless it serves the interest of fairness.

In our case, the Debtor’s disclosure regarding her communications with her Bankruptcy Attorney about the District Court Action triggers a subject-matter waiver. Thus, any communications and documents pertaining to the disclosure or non-disclosure of the District Court Action to her Bankruptcy Attorney are no longer privileged.

Finally, the implied waiver doctrine, as discussed in the case 128 F.3d 313, reiterates that any voluntary disclosure of privileged information can extend the waiver to all communications on the subject matter, emphasizing strategic fairness and the avoidance of a "hide-and-seek" approach in litigation.

Given these precedents, the Court finds the Debtor has waived the attorney-client privilege concerning any communications related directly or indirectly to the disclosure or omission of the District Court Action in her bankruptcy filings.
