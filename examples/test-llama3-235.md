To determine the allowability of claims in bankruptcy proceedings, federal law is applied, as stated in Vanston Bondholders Protective Committee v. Green, 329 U.S. 156, 67 S.Ct. 237, 91 L.Ed. 162. However, federal law should be applied with "appropriate regard for rights acquired under rules of state law," as mentioned in American Surety Co. v. Sampsell, 327 U.S. 269, 66 S.Ct. 571, 90 L.Ed. 663.

In the case at hand, the Trustee argues that NAC, a Delaware corporation, is doing business in Tennessee without qualifying as a foreign corporation, thereby rendering the claim void. However, the District Court held that the contract is not void but merely unenforceable in state courts, citing Lloyd Thomas Co. v. Grosvenor, 144 Tenn. 347, 233 S.W. 669.

The Supreme Court of Tennessee has held that contracts entered into by non-qualifying foreign corporations are not absolutely void, but may be unenforceable. Biggs v. Reliance Life Ins. Co., 137 Tenn. 598, 195 S.W. 174. Furthermore, the court has stated that contracts and transactions of non-qualifying foreign corporations are not void, but are merely unenforceable in state courts in actions initiated by the offending corporation. Singer Mfg. Co. v. Draper, 103 Tenn. 262, 52 S.W. 879.

In the instant case, the claim is not absolutely void, but may be unenforceable in the state courts. Therefore, under federal law, the claim should be allowed. This decision is supported by Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, which held that federal courts should apply federal law in diversity cases.

Additionally, the decision is supported by Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Co., 337 U.S. 535, which held that federal courts should apply federal law in cases involving federal bankruptcy law. Furthermore, the decision is supported by In re V-I-D, Inc., 198 F.2d 392, which held that federal law should be applied in bankruptcy proceedings with "appropriate regard for rights acquired under rules of state law."

In conclusion, the claim should be allowed under federal law, as it is not absolutely void

gold_text: The Trustee makes the argument that if the claim would not be enforced in the state court then, under the Erie doctrine, Erie R. R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, it should not be enforced in a federal court sitting in that state. In support of this proposition, the Trustee cites Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., 337 U.S. 535, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524. This argument overlooks the fact that jurisdiction in the instant case is based on federal bankruptcy law and not on diversity of citizenship. Thus a bankruptcy court does not sit “as if it were only another state court,” and Erie does not apply. Vanston Bondholders Protective Committee v. Green, 329 U.S. 156, 162, 67 S.Ct. 237, 240. Similarly, Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., supra, being a diversity case, has no bearing on this case. In re V-I-D, Inc., 198 F.2d 392, 396 (C.A. 7), cert. denied, Kelley, Glover & Vale v. Kramer, 344 U.S. 914, 73 S.Ct. 337, 97 L.Ed. 705.
