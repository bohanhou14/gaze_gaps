**Generation:**

In the present case, unlike Roberts' case (71 T.C. 311 (1978)), where the control over the trustee's actions precluded a finding of a mere conduit, here Spencer Stewart retained substantial control over Stewart Property Management, Inc. (SPM). Section 453’s installment sale provisions require that the seller does not directly or indirectly control the proceeds from the sale. According to the Lustgarten decision (639 F.2d 1208), the decisive factor is whether the taxpayer retains economic benefit and control over the proceeds. Spencer Stewart guaranteed SPM’s loan and the securities sold were directly used to discharge this obligation, thereby benefitting him economically.

Moreover, as established in Williams v. United States, 219 F.2d 523, the taxpayer's control over the proceeds constitutes a constructive receipt of income. Here, since the Stewart's sale of securities to SPM involved a direct benefit—discharging SPM’s loan and his personal guarantee—the economic benefit and control over the proceeds were effectively retained by Stewart.

Given these circumstances, Stewart's transaction with SPM is more akin to a direct sale rather than an installment sale to an independent entity. Therefore, the district court erred in allowing installment sale treatment. We reverse the district court's judgment on the third issue.

gold_text: The district court applied the rule expressed in Roberts, and concluded that Stewart did not have control over the proceeds of the sale because the bank, and not SPM, had sold the stock. The district court noted, “if the only intermediary involved were SPM, and if SPM had sold the stock on the market the defendant’s arguments would possibly have merit.” Thus, the bank played a role similar to that of the trust in Roberts. We find no basis for reversing the district court’s determination. Cases in which the taxpayer has been denied use of installment treatment on the “conduit” theory are ones in which the taxpayer had control of the proceeds, subject only to self-imposed restrictions. See, e.g., Lustgarten v. Commissioner, 639 F.2d 1208 (5th Cir.1981) (taxpayer could not use installment reporting for sale of stock to son because, through a series of agreements with the son, he effectively controlled the sale of the stock, the reinvestment of the proceeds in the mutual fund and the placing, of those shares in escrow); Williams v. United States, 219 F.2d 523 (5th Cir.1955) (self-imposed restriction, created when the taxpayer sold some property and had part of the price placed in escrow to be paid out in installments, did not change the fact that, at the time of the sale, the taxpayer had constructively received the entire payment).
