In this case, the law officer's instructions on the voluntariness of the appellant's confession were found to be confusingly structured and worded, resulting in a lack of meaningful legal guidelines for the court-martial. The instruction failed to provide a clear and accurate explanation of the burden of proof, and instead, introduced an erroneous warning prerequisite and an erroneous burden of proof standard. This instruction is similar to the one in United States v Waller, 11 USCMA 295, 29 CMR 111 (1960), which was found to be defective and prejudicial.

The instruction also failed to cover the appellant's request for counsel, which is a fundamental right under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This failure is similar to the one in United States v Noe, 7 USCMA 408, 22 CMR 198, where the court held that the failure to instruct on the right to counsel was prejudicial.

Furthermore, the instruction created a conflict between the law officer's statement that the accused must be presumed innocent until his guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond any reasonable doubt, and the statement that the accused's failure to find an essential element of the offense was not enough to entitle him to an acquittal. This conflict is similar to the one in United States v Rowan, 4 USCMA 430, 16 CMR 4, where the court held that the instruction was confusing and prejudicial.

In conclusion, the law officer's instructions on the voluntariness of the appellant's confession were confusingly structured and worded, resulting in a lack of meaningful legal guidelines for the court-martial. The instruction failed to provide a clear and accurate explanation of the burden of proof, and instead, introduced an erroneous warning prerequisite and an erroneous burden of proof standard. This instruction is similar to the ones in United States v Waller, 11 USCMA 295, 29 CMR 111 (1960), United States v Noe, 7 USCMA 408, 22 CMR 198, and United States v Rowan, 4 USCMA 430, 16 CMR 4, which were all found to be defective and prejudicial.

gold_text: The instruction is obviously not a model of clarity, but syntactical nicety is not the standard of instructional adequacy. In United States v Smith, 8 USCMA 582, 584, 25 CMR 86 (1958), the Court said, “It is not the number or the position of the commas, semicolons, or periods that counts, but whether the instruction as a whole provides meaningful legal principles for the court-martial’s consideration. United States v Noe, 7 USCMA 408, 22 CMR 198.” If, when gathered together, the instruction states the law “properly and with sufficient clarity to be understood by the members of the court-martial, then they are not prejudicial even though one sentence may be technically incorrect.” United States v Hatchett, 2 USCMA 482, 488, 9 CMR 112 (1953). Where there are mutually inconsistent standards the erroneous one eradicates the beneficial effect of the correct one, however, and utilization of the “instruction as a whole” doctrine becomes inappropriate. United States v Pelletier, 15 USCMA 654, 36 CMR 152 (1966); United States v Skonberg, 10 USCMA 57, 27 CMR 131 (1958).
