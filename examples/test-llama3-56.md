In the reference case 867 F.2d 1209, the court ruled that the Secretary's failure to specify reasons for discounting a claimant's testimony of disabling fatigue was legal error. Similarly, in the reference case 844 F.2d 664, the court held that the Secretary's reliance on vocational expert testimony that conflicted with the Medical Vocational Guidelines was error.

In the case at hand, the Secretary's decision to deny benefits to the claimant is based on the vocational expert's testimony that the claimant could perform a substantial number of jobs despite his non-exertional limitations. However, this testimony conflicts with the Medical Vocational Guidelines, which would require a finding of disability. Therefore, the Secretary's decision is not supported by substantial evidence.

Furthermore, the Secretary failed to specify reasons for discounting the claimant's testimony of disabling fatigue. This is an error that has been consistently held by the courts, including in the reference case 867 F.2d 1209.

In light of these errors, we conclude that the Secretary's decision to deny benefits to the claimant is not supported by substantial evidence and is thus reversed. The claimant is entitled to benefits, and the case is remanded for payment of benefits.

The court has discretion to award attorney's fees in cases where the Secretary's decision is reversed. In this case, the claimant has prevailed and is entitled to attorney's fees. The amount of attorney's fees will be determined by the court.

It allows prevailing plaintiffs in these cases to recover fees “unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified_” 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A); Hammock v. Bowen, 867 F.2d 1209, 1216 (9th Cir.1989). Swenson prevailed on the merits. See, e.g., Gregory v. Bowen, 844 F.2d 664, 667 (9th Cir.1988). Whether the Secretary’s position was substantially justified will be determined by the district court. Pierce v. Underwood, — U.S. —, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2547, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988); Hammock, 867 F.2d at 1216. We remand to that court to determine that matter.
