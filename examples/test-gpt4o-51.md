It is also pertinent to consider the factors outlined in **Mathews v. Eldridge**, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), as referenced in both **452 U.S. 18** and **424 U.S. 319**, when analyzing the necessity of appointing counsel. As per the Eldridge factors, the first consideration is the private interest affected—in this case, Robinson's liberty and the potential reduction of his sentence.

The second factor is the risk of erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used. Given the complexities involved in interpreting the retroactive application of the Sentencing Guidelines and addressing factual disputes, the risk of error is significant without the aid of counsel.

The third factor is the Government’s interest, which includes evaluating the fiscal and administrative burden of appointing an attorney. While concerns about resource allocation are valid, they are outweighed by the need to ensure fair and accurate adjudication of Robinson's request for sentence reduction.

Therefore, consistent with the principles established in Eldridge, the appointment of counsel is justified to safeguard Robinson’s procedural rights. This approach ensures that the legal proceedings are thorough and that Robinson's due process rights are upheld.

MOTION GRANTED.
