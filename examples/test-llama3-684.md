The court in Masao Hirasuna v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue case (238 F.2d 878) held that custom-made automobile seat covers are subject to the federal excise tax under Section 3403(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The court concluded that the seat covers are "parts or accessories" within the meaning of the statute, and that the taxpayer, Hirasuna, was the "manufacturer" of the seat covers.

The court's decision is supported by the definition of "parts or accessories" in Treasury Regulation 46 (1940 ed.), which includes articles that are designed to be attached to or used in connection with an automobile body to add to its utility or ornamentation. The court also noted that the seat covers are not exempt from the tax simply because they are custom-made or installed on a used car.

In contrast, the court in John J. Roche Co. v. Eaton (14 F.2d 857) held that the dominant aspect of the transaction was the work performed, and that the furnishing of specially fashioned materials was but an incident of the major transaction. However, this decision is distinguishable from the present case, as it involved a broader range of transactions, including the repair of automobile bodies.

In conclusion, the court's decision in Masao Hirasuna v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue is consistent with the statutory language and the regulatory definition of "parts or accessories." The court's conclusion that custom-made automobile seat covers are subject to the federal excise tax is supported by the evidence and is consistent with the principles of taxation.

In applying section 3403(c) its language must be accorded reasonable scope, including different types of manufacturing. The tax must not be so narrowly applied as to leave beyond its reach activities which are fairly within the intendment and language of the statute.
