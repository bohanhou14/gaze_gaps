The case at hand involves a dispute between Anitora Travel, Inc. (plaintiff) and its former employee, defendant. The plaintiff claims that the defendant engaged in fraudulent activities, including selling airline tickets at a discounted price, and thereby injured the plaintiff's business and property. The plaintiff seeks damages under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1962.

To state a claim under RICO, the plaintiff must allege that the defendant conducted or participated in the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). In this case, the plaintiff argues that the defendant conducted the affairs of the plaintiff through a pattern of racketeering activity, but the court disagrees.

In United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981), the Supreme Court defined an "enterprise" as "a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct." Similarly, in Beck v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., 820 F.2d 46, 51 (2d Cir. 1987), the Second Circuit held that an "enterprise" must be a continuing operation, and that the predicate acts must be related to the common purpose.

The plaintiff's amended complaint fails to allege a continuing operation or a common purpose of the enterprise. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not alleged that the defendant's fraudulent activities were related to the common purpose of the enterprise.

In conclusion, the plaintiff's amended complaint fails to state a claim under RICO. The court grants the defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint.

gold_text: For purposes of violations of § 1962(c), plaintiff has also failed to state a civil RICO claim even if the complaint is read to allege that defendant himself is the enterprise. It is well established in this Circuit that with respect to § 1962(c) — as opposed to § 1962(a) — the enterprise and the defendant cannot be the same person or entity. See Bennett v. United States Trust Co. of New York, 770 F.2d 308, 315 (2d Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1058, 106 S.Ct. 800, 88 L.Ed.2d 776 (1986); see also Haroco, Inc. v.
