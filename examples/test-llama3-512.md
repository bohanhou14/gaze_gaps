In the context of legal cases, a preliminary injunction is a court order that restrains a party from engaging in a certain activity or taking a specific action until a full trial has been conducted. The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to prevent irreparable harm or damage to the plaintiff until the merits of the case can be determined.

In the case of Krentzman v. State of Florida, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to restrain the defendants, law enforcement officials, from enforcing the Florida Statutes related to obscenity. The plaintiffs alleged that the arrests and seizures of their publications, without a prior adversary determination of obscenity, would cause irreparable harm to their business.

The court, in considering the motion for a preliminary injunction, noted that the procedures leading to the condemnation of the publications were constitutionally deficient, similar to those in Marcus v. Search Warrant, 367 U.S. 717. The court also recognized that the warrant issued in this case authorized the seizure of all copies of the specified titles, without prior submission of any publications to the judge issuing the warrant, and without a hearing on the question of obscenity.

Furthermore, the court observed that the State was not attempting to punish the distributors for disobedience of any interim order entered before hearing, but rather was imposing an effective restraint on the circulation of the publications, similar to the restraints in Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown, 354 U.S. 436.

Based on these findings, the court granted the preliminary injunction, reasoning that the arrests and seizures of the publications, without a prior adversary determination of obscenity, would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.

In summary, the court's decision in Krentzman v. State of Florida highlights the importance of adhering to constitutional procedures in the enforcement of obscenity laws, and the need for a preliminary injunction to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiff until the merits of the case can be determined.
