The legal cases you provided are complex and multifaceted, involving issues such as ADEA violations, willfulness, and evidentiary rulings. To address your questions, I will need to analyze each case and provide a concise summary.

Firstly, regarding the case 115 F.3d 676, the Supreme Court held that a willful violation of the ADEA would be shown where the defendant “knew or showed reckless disregard” for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited (Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 617, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 1709, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993)).

In reference case 831 F.2d 1514, the court applied the Digidyne standard in denying a motion for a new trial, stating that the verdict was not against the “great weight” of the evidence or “seriously erroneous” (Digidyne Corp. v. Data Gen. Corp., 734 F.2d 1336, 1347 (9th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 473 U.S. 908, 105 S.Ct. 3534, 87 L.Ed.2d 657 (1985)).

Regarding the case 64 F.3d 1323, the court denied a motion for judgment as a matter of law, finding that the district court’s admission of evidence was proper and did not prejudice the defendant (United States v. Dunn, 946 F.2d 615, 617 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 950, 112 S.Ct. 401, 116 L.Ed.2d 350 (1991)).

Finally, in your own case, the district court correctly granted summary judgment on Jensen’s negligence per se claim, as she failed to satisfy the first-prong of the negligence per se inquiry (Cal. Serv. Station & Auto. Repair Ass’n v. Am. Home Assurance Co., 62 Cal.App.4th 1166, 1178, 73 Cal.Rptr.2d 182 (1998); Sierra-Bay Fed. Land Bank Ass’n v. Superior Court, 227 Cal.App.3d 318, 333, 277 Cal.Rptr. 753 (1991)). The court

gold_text: A jury verdict should ordinarily be set aside only when it is against the “great weight” of the evidence or it is clear that the jury has reached a “seriously erroneous result.” EEOC v. Pape Lift, Inc., 115 F.3d 676, 680 (9th Cir.1997) (quoting Venegas v. Wagner, 831 F.2d 1514, 1519 (9th Cir.1987)). When a new trial is sought on the basis of erroneous evidentiary rulings, a new trial is warranted only if those erroneous rulings substantially prejudiced the moving party. See Ruvalcaba v. City of Los Angeles, 64 F.3d 1323, 1328 (9th Cir.1995).
