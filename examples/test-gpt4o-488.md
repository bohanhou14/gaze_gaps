III. ANALYSIS OF OBJECTIONS

The petitioner’s reliance on the principle of per se ineffective assistance of counsel due to an attorney’s failure to file a notice of appeal is well-supported. As referenced in 727 F.2d 91, failure to file objections waives the right to appeal, but this does not preclude the court from considering the merits of ineffective assistance claims.

The Federal Magistrates Act, referenced in 766 F.2d 841, stipulates the necessity of de novo review of a magistrate’s report when objections are filed. Petitioner’s waiver of appeal rights under the plea agreement and subsequent failure to follow through with filing objections do not diminish the responsibility of representation post-sentencing. 

In 474 U.S. 140, the court affirmed the necessity of fundamental fairness in proceedings. Thus, Mr. Lambert’s failure to file the notice of appeal, despite being informed by petitioner within the permissible timeframe, constitutes a deprivation of petitioner’s rights per established precedents (referenced cases 727 F.2d 91 and 766 F.2d 841).

CONCLUSION

For the reasons stated above and in compliance with the directives under the cited references, the Court finds the Government’s objections unconvincing and upholds the Magistrate Judge’s recommendation.

1. The Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation [Cr. Doc. 141] is AFFIRMED and ADOPTED.
2. Petitioner’s § 2255 Motion [Cr. Doc. 103] is GRANTED in part, specifically on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding the failure to file an appeal.

It is so ORDERED.

The Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of this Order to all counsel of record herein and to mail a copy to the pro se petitioner.
