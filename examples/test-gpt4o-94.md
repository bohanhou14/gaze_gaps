The remaining issue concerns the corporate records. The government argues that these should not be suppressed even if the individual records and statements are excluded. In United States v. Wilson, 221 U.S. 361, 385 (1911), the Supreme Court held that corporate records are not protected by personal privileges available to individuals. The Court reasoned that corporate officers, such as Jobin, hold and use corporate records purely in an official capacity, and thus cannot claim personal rights over said records as against a valid governmental demand. This principle was reaffirmed in 417 U.S. 85, which explicitly states that the privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to corporate records, irrespective of whether the investigation targets the corporation or an individual.

Applying these precedents, it is clear that Jobin’s objection to producing the corporate records lacks legal foundation. The duty to comply with lawful summonses lies with the corporation, independent of personal rights. Therefore, we hold that the district court erred in suppressing the Embassy corporate records obtained during any of the meetings. The suppression applies solely to individual records and statements garnered from the taxpayer, Claude Jobin. Consequently, the Embassy corporate records should be available for the government's prosecutorial use.

In conclusion, we affirm the district court's suppression of evidence obtained from Jobin personally on the morning of May 2, 1973, and reverse the suppression order with respect to the Embassy corporate records and any subsequent information obtained after the proper warnings were given.

gold_text: The final question raised by appellant government is whether corporate records should be excluded as a sanction for non-compliance with the warning regulations. Some of the records obtained in the morning meeting were apparently those of Embassy Homes, Inc., the incorporated portion of Jobin’s business. The warning regulations themselves are phrased in terms of a natural person, and are not designed to highlight any privilege possessed by a corporation. See United States v. Sourapas, supra, 515 F.2d at 299. More significantly, it is firmly established that the corporation has no Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and no corporate officer can prevent the disclosure of corporate records which may personally incriminate him. Wilson v. United States, 221 U.S. 361, 31 S.Ct. 538, 55 L.Ed. 771 (1911); see Bellis v. United States, 417 U.S. 85, 94 S.Ct. 2179, 40 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974). Thus, the IRS could have obtained the corporate records through enforcement, 26 U.S.C. § 7604, of the summonses issued to Jobin if he had asserted his rights.
