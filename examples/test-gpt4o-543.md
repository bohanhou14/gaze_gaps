Malik's federal discrimination claims, based on racial and religious discrimination, must be analyzed under the appropriate statutory frameworks. Malik invokes 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1982, and 2000d et seq., as well as 49 U.S.C. § 40127.

To establish a claim under § 1981, the plaintiff must allege: (1) membership in a racial minority; (2) an intent to discriminate on the basis of race by the defendant; and (3) the discrimination concerns one or more activities enumerated in the statute, such as the right to "make and enforce contracts" (Reference ID: 27 F.3d 1083). Malik alleges that Continental's discriminatory actions were racially and religiously motivated, and no similarly situated persons on her flight were treated the same way.

However, Malik's allegations must show intentional discrimination (Reference ID: 804 F.2d 873). The factual allegations must be more than speculative, reaching the threshold of plausibility as outlined in Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly (550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Malik's complaint contains her subjective belief of being targeted due to her racial and ethnic background, but lacks specific factual allegations illustrating that the flight attendants harbored discriminatory intent directly linked to her racial or religious identity.

For Malik’s Title VI (42 U.S.C. § 2000d) claims, she must demonstrate that she was excluded, denied benefits, or subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. The Supreme Court has held that the statute authorizes private rights of action only where the specific discriminatory intent can be proved (Reference ID: 532 U.S. 275).

Given Malik's insufficient factual assertions to state plausible claims for racial and religious discrimination, we concur with the district court's dismissal of these claims. Consequently, Malik's remaining federal common law claim for lost luggage should proceed for further proceedings in district court.

gold_text: We also conclude that the district court properly dismissed Malik’s federal claims for racial and religious discrimination. Malik asserts claims for violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1982, 2000d et seq., and 49 U.S.C. § 40127. Each of these statutes requires a litigant to plead facts in support of intentional discrimination. 49 U.S.C. § 40127 (mandating air earner not subject person in air travel to discrimination on basis of race, color or national origin); Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 281, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001) (Title VI prohibits intentional discrimination); Green v. State Bar of Tex., 27 F.3d 1083, 1086 (5th Cir.1994) (noting that plaintiff must allege facts showing intent to discriminate to state a claim under § 1981); Vaughner v. Pulito, 804 F.2d 873, 877 (5th Cir.1986) (“A cause of action based upon section 1982 ... requires an intentional act of racial discrimination.”).
