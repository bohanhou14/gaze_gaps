VII. COLLUSIVE APPOINTMENT AND JURISDICTION

The appointment of Charline Hamilton as administratrix raises a significant issue of whether this constitutes a collusive appointment intended solely to confer diversity jurisdiction. In Bass v. Texas Power & Light Co., 432 F.2d 763 (5th Cir. 1970), the court held that the appointment of an out-of-state administrator for the sole purpose of creating diversity jurisdiction is improper. Similarly, in McSparran v. Weist, followed in 434 F.2d 1096, it was established that such appointments lack substantive validity when they serve only to manufacture federal jurisdiction.

Further, in the case of 433 F.2d 324, the court emphasized that inquiry into the purpose of the appointment is essential when there are concerns about manufactured diversity. The burden of proving the legitimacy of the jurisdiction lies with the party seeking federal jurisdiction (referencing McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178). Given these precedents, the legitimacy of Hamilton's appointment must be scrutinized to determine if it violates 28 U.S.C. § 1359 which bars collusive assignments intended to create jurisdiction.

VIII. APPLICATION OF § 1359 PRECEDENTS

The precedent set by Corabi v. Auto Racing, Inc., supported by 392 F.2d 387, clarifies that any assignment or appointment intending to manufacture federal jurisdiction is deemed improper or collusive. In this case, Hamilton’s appointment appears strategically timed to address jurisdictional deficiencies, mirroring the situation in the City of Eufaula case presented in 394 U.S. 823. Thus, if Hamilton's appointment is found purely jurisdictional, it undermines the court's authority to adjudicate this case.

We conclude upon these references and legal precedents that the trial court may need to revisit the determination of jurisdiction based on Hamilton's appointment. If found collusive, it would necessitate dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, aligning with the principles outlined in the cited cases.

IX. CONCLUSION

In light of the discussed legal standards and relevant case law, the legitimacy of Hamilton’s appointment as administratrix significantly impacts the court’s jurisdiction. To uphold judicial integrity, it is crucial to ensure that jurisdiction is not manufactured. Therefore, further inquiry into the appointment's purpose is mandated, adhering to the doctrines established in Bass and McSparran (432 F.2d 763, 434 F.2d 1096).
