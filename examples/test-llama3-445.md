**Generation:**

 <answer>As the court has already discussed, the definition of a security under the Securities Laws is broad and encompasses various types of investments. In the present case, the limited partnership units sold to the investors can be considered an investment contract, as they were marketed as a means to generate profits through the management efforts of the general partners. The court in S.E.C. v. W.J. Howey Company, 328 U.S. 293, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946), held that an investment contract is an investment in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits derived solely from the efforts of others.

In the present case, the investors were promised a share of the profits generated by the management of the Berkeley Square Apartments, and therefore, the limited partnership units can be considered an investment contract. The court in Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 88 S.Ct. 548, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967), further clarified

Wicker, Moore’s Federal Practice ¶ 56.17[41.2] (2d ed. 1988) (“Summary judgment is generally inappropriate when issues of motive, intent, and other subjective feelings and reactions are material.”); Friedman v. Meyers, 482 F.2d 435, 439 (2d Cir.1973). Moreover, the contract’s reference to “problems relating to pipes which have been breaking periodically” is ambiguous under the circumstances, since it does not indicate whether the problem is serious or whether it could be economically repaired. This legitimate factual dispute concerning the contract’s terms precludes summary judgment on this question. Wards Company, Inc. v. Stamford Ridgeway Associates, 761 F.2d 117, 120 (2d Cir.1985); Ralli v. Tavern on the Green, 566 F.Supp. 329, 331 (S.D.N.Y.1983) (Lasker, J.).
