Jones's reliance on United States v. Chin is misplaced for multiple reasons. Balancing the right of confrontation against the reliability of evidence and the government’s reasons for not allowing direct testimony, we find ample case law supporting the district court’s decision. In 502 U.S. 346, the Court emphasized that "firmly rooted" hearsay exceptions carry sufficient indicia of reliability, as seen in Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 182-184 (1987). Furthermore, in cases like Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, and Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805, the Confrontation Clause does not bar the use of certain types of hearsay if they possess substantial guarantees of trustworthiness (See 806 F.2d 39). Additionally, courts have sometimes accepted hearsay where direct confrontation would expose witnesses to potential harm, echoing the government's justification here involving a minor and risk of retribution (see 475 U.S. 387). Given these precedents, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting hearsay evidence under established exceptions.

gold_text: The hearsay testimony offered in Chin did not appear to fall within any exception to the hearsay rule; neither was there any discussion in Chin of the applicability of hearsay exceptions. See id. at 123. This is significant because it is well established that where the government seeks to introduce testimony under the excited utterance exception, and where that testimony is properly admitted by the district court, the government is under no constitutional obligation to explain the unavailability of the hearsay declarant. See White v. Illinois, 502 U.S. 346, 353-358, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (ruling that Confrontation Clause does not require showing of witness unavailability where hearsay statements of witness were admissible under “spontaneous declaration” exception); Tocco, 135 F.3d at 128 (applying White to uphold admission of “excited utterance” without showing of unavailability); see also United States v. Inadi, 475 U.S. 387, 394-98, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986) (holding that showing of witness unavailability was not required under Confrontation Clause for admission of out-of-court statements made by co-conspirators); Reardon v. Manson, 806 F.2d 39, 41 (2d Cir.1986) (“The unavailability rule ... was developed in a series of cases in which the prosecution offered written records of prior testimony in place of live testimony at trial, and the rule should not be extended mechanically to other factual contexts.”). Consequently, Chin’s requirement that the district court consider “the government’s grounds for not allowing confrontation” does not apply to the instant case. But, even if we were to consider this prong of the Chin test, we accept the validity of the government’s stated reasons for not calling the hearsay declarants. First, with regard to the teenage girl Karin, her age and the sexual nature of the testimony she would be required to give furnish ample justification for the government’s decision not to call her. Second, with regard to both eyewitnesses, Jones’s history of violent conduct made reprisal against them a possibility. There was no error in the district court’s acceptance of those reasons.
