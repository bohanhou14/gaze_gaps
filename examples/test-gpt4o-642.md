**Generation:**

On appeal, Brewer contends that the district court erred in not fully reconsidering the authenticity of the July 2012 document during the resentencing, especially in light of new evidence purportedly impeaching Pettus's testimony. However, as established in the precedent of Thompson remands, the district court has broad discretion to accept or reject new evidence or arguments during resentencing (833 F.3d 797). The district court explicitly acknowledged its authority to consider new material but ultimately found no reason to alter its initial findings on the document's fabrication.

Furthermore, Brewer's argument mirrors the situation in United States v. Lewis, where a defendant raised a late claim only at resentencing, but the court found it was waived for not being presented originally (842 F.3d 467). Similarly, Brewer's minimal mention of the document's legitimacy during the resentencing memorandum, and the lack of active presentation of new evidence or arguments, did not preserve this issue for appeal. The district judge was within his discretion to uphold the original obstruction of justice enhancement.

Therefore, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

gold_text: In this second appeal, Brewer challenges only the finding that she obstructed justice by submitting a false document during the sentencing proceedings. The government counters that Brewer waived this claim “by disavowing it on her first appeal.” But as we explained recently in United States v. Mobley, “a Thompson remand gives a district court the power to hear new evidence or arguments (or reconsider the same evidence and arguments) as it fashions the new sentence.” 833 F.3d 797, 802 (7th Cir. 2016). And though after a Thompson remand a district court is not required to consider evidence or arguments that could have been presented during an earlier appeal, the district court “is required to acknowledge that it has this power and explain why or why not it wishes to exercise it.” Id. at 801; see United States v. Lewis, 842 F.3d 467, 473-74 (7th Cir. 2016) (“A remand in light of Thompson vacates the entire sentence, allowing the district court to alter any aspect of that sentence at resentencing.”).
