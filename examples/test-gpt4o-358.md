**Generation:**

Based on the principles from the reference cases, we find that Weiser #2’s rental payments to Foundation do not qualify as deductible business expenses under section 23(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code. In reference case 12 T.C. 539, the payments made in similar transactions were deemed distributions of corporate earnings rather than legitimate business expenses. As in Ingle Coal Co., 10 T.C. 1199, the arrangements led to the conclusion that purported rentals were actually distributions of earnings.

Furthermore, the burden of proof to establish the right to deductions, as outlined in reference case 27 T.C. 413, resides with the taxpayer. Weiser #2 has not sufficiently demonstrated that the payments to Foundation were more than disguised profit distributions. The payments were substantially linked to Weiser #1’s former ownership, Russell’s control, and the structured financial transactions, which were intended to produce favorable tax consequences.

Thus, similar to the disallowance of unsubstantiated promotional expenses in 27 T.C. 413, the rental payments to Foundation are disallowed as deductible rental expenses. Instead, these payments are considered non-deductible distributions of earnings, thus affirming the respondent's determination.

gold_text: We recognize that this record is far less favorable to respondent than that we met in Kolhey. Nevertheless, we conclude that petitioner has failed to sustain his burden of proving that the transactions entered into had the real effect of separating equity in the business assets from use of the business assets. Accordingly, we cannot say that Weiser #2 was required to pay these amounts or any amounts for the use of property in which it has no equity. See Catherine G. Armston, 12 T.C. 539 (1949), affd. 188 F. 2d 531 (C.A. 5, 1951); R.E.L. Finley, 27 T.C. 413 (1956), affd. 255 F. 2d 128 (C.A. 10, 1958).
