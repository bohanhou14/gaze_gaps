In evaluating the reasonableness of Roberts’ actions in seeking an accommodation, it is important to balance the protection of employees asserting their rights against an employer’s legitimate demands for loyalty and productivity (see Payne, 654 F.2d 1142). The determination of reasonableness is fact-specific and involves assessing whether the employee’s manner of opposition was reasonable (see Whatley v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 632 F.2d 1325, 1329; Rosser v. Laborers’ Int’l Union Local No. 438, 616 F.2d 221, 223). 

Roberts must prove that his conduct was protected and that Rayonier's action was not motivated by legitimate concerns. Previous cases, such as Jones v. Flagship Int’l, establish that an employee’s complaints must be reasonable and not disrupt the work environment excessively (793 F.2d 714, 728). Moreover, if an employee's manner of expression is found unreasonable, it may constitute a legitimate basis for adverse action (Hochstadt v. Worcester Found. for Experimental Biology, 545 F.2d 222, 231).

Considering Roberts sought outside counsel for what seemed a reasonable accommodation, the temporal connection and the absence of clear breaches of confidentiality support this claim (736 F.3d 1183, 1187). Roberts’ termination shortly after seeking accommodation and Rayonier's cited reasons imply pretext, as no substantial investigation into the alleged breaches was conducted (144 F.3d 364). Thus, sufficient material facts exist regarding whether Rayonier’s reasons were pretextual, necessitating further judicial review (615 F.2d 1025).

gold_text: As an alternative basis for affirming the judgment of the district court with respect to this accommodation retaliation claim, Rayonier argues that the manner in which Roberts exercised his right to oppose taking the medical test was unreasonable and therefore not statutorily protected activity. In this regard, Rayonier argues that Roberts never clearly communicated to Rayonier that his request was in the'nature of an ADA accommodation, nor did he clearly apprise Rayonier of his opinion that the test as applied to him would violate the ADA. Most particularly, Rayonier argues that Roberts’ selection of Thomas as his attorney was unreasonable in light of the fact that Thomas and/or others in his office were plaintiffs’ lawyers who had recently brought employment discrimination cases against Rayonier, and actually had one matter still pending. Rayonier supports its argument by pointing to numerous eases in which courts have found that unreasonable exercise of actions that would otherwise be protected under Title VII is unprotected. See Rollins v. State of Fla. Dept. of Law Enforcement, 868 F.2d 397 (11th Cir.1989); Rosser v. Laborers’ Intern. Union of N.America, 616 F.2d 221 (5th Cir.1980) (holding that although opposition to unlawful employment practices is protected, such protection is not absolute); Jefferies v. Harris County Community Assoc., 615 F.2d 1025 (5th Cir.1980) (ac cord, and applying a balancing test); see also Douglas v. DynMcDermott Petroleum Operations Co., 144 F.3d 364 (5th Cir.1998) (involving in-house counsel); Jones v. Flagship Int'l, 793 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1986) (involving in-house counsel). Rayonier suggests that as an in-house attorney having duties of loyalty and confidentiality to Rayonier, Roberts was unreasonable in hiring Thomas, an attorney who had recently sued the company and who was likely to use in other cases against the company any confidential information which Roberts might appropriately reveal to him. At this stage of the case, we decline to address the issue because the district court has not addressed the issue; because developments in the case may make it unnecessary to address the issue; and because, if the issue is to be addressed, the district court may determine that the inquiry would be facilitated by additional development of the relevant facts.
