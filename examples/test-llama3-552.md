The Noels' appeal to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals presents several challenges to the district court's decision. One of the primary issues is the jury instruction on the use of force by Officer Artson. The Noels contend that the district court erred in not providing a separate instruction on the third shot, arguing that it was unreasonable. However, the court's instruction on reasonableness adequately informed the jury of the controlling legal principles without misleading or confusing them.

In support of this argument, the court cited the Supreme Court's decision in Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. 1865 (1989), which held that all claims of excessive force must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness standard. The court also noted that the Noels were free to argue that the officers' methods were unreasonable, citing the case of Waterman v. Batton, 393 F.3d 471, 481 (4th Cir.2005).

Regarding the no-knock entry, the court held that the officers' decision to enter the residence without knocking was reasonable, citing the case of Aldridge v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 89 S.Ct. 961 (1969). The court also noted that the officers had a legitimate concern for their safety, given the presence of a firearm in the residence.

In conclusion, the district court's decision was affirmed, as the jury instructions and the court's analysis of the evidence were reasonable and supported by the law. The Noels' arguments were adequately addressed through the court's instructions and the evidence presented at trial.

gold_text: We discern no abuse of discretion on voir dire, for Charles Noel’s thirty-year-old conviction for second-degree murder played at most a minor role in this case. The trial court is not bound to ask members of the venire questions about every evidentiary tangent or by-way, see, e.g., Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.S. 524, 527-28, 93 S.Ct. 848, 35 L.Ed.2d 46 (1973) (upholding a state trial court’s refusal to ask voir dire questions regarding prejudice against beards), and “[a]bsent a showing of compelling need to propound such questions, we think the district judge clearly correct in refusing them,” Langley v. Turner’s Express, Inc., 375 F.2d 296, 298 (4th Cir.1967). We accordingly hold that the district court’s refusal to ask questions regarding the murder conviction demonstrated “reasonable restraint” in questioning that in no way prejudiced the Noels. Id. at 297.
