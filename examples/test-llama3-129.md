In the context of legal cases, jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and decide a case. According to reference case 285 U.S. 413, a court having jurisdiction over parties and subject matter is under a duty to exercise its jurisdiction in a case falling within the purview of the jurisdiction. However, reference case 103 F.2d 613 suggests that a court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction in certain circumstances. 

In the case at hand, the court dismissed the action for declaratory judgment, citing that the parties' interest were identical, and that the claimant was the only real party in interest. The court also noted that the declaratory judgment sought would not relieve the plaintiff of the duty to defend the actions instituted against the insured, and that the real controversy was between the claimant and the insured, not between the plaintiff and the insured. 

Furthermore, the court pointed out that the issue of whether Miller was an employee of the insured at the time of his injury and death was a question that was necessarily involved in the actions already pending in the state court, and that it could be tried in those actions just as well as in the declaratory judgment suit. 

In conclusion, the case at hand illustrates the discretion vested in the court with respect to the granting or refusing of declaratory relief, even in cases of which it unquestionably has jurisdiction. The court's decision was sound, taking into account the identical interests of the parties, the availability of other remedies, and the potential for piecemeal trying of controversies. 

Additionally, reference case 102 F.2d 288 suggests that the courts are inclined to decline to exercise jurisdiction when there is no controversy of any sort between the parties, and that the party with whom there is no controversy should be aligned on the side on which it belongs. 

In this case, the court's decision is consistent with the principles outlined in these reference cases, and demonstrates the importance of considering the parties' interests, the availability of other remedies, and the potential for piecemeal trying of controversies when exercising jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action.
