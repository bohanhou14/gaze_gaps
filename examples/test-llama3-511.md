The government's motion to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in this condemnation case raises several issues regarding just compensation, the power of purchase, and the effect of an agreement between the parties on the amount of compensation.

In reference to case 308 U.S. 271, the court held that the power of purchase is not a condition precedent to the exercise of the power of eminent domain, and that the government's power to condemn property is not affected by the existence of an option to purchase. However, in this case, the government's offer to purchase the land was not accepted, and the parties did not reach an agreement on the amount of compensation.

Moreover, the government's reliance on case 98 F.2d 609 is misplaced, as that case involved a different set of facts and did not address the issue of an agreement between the parties on the amount of compensation. In that case, the court held that the government's failure to acquire the land through purchase did not affect its ability to condemn the property.

In reference to case 140 F.2d 941, the court held that the government's power to condemn property is not affected by an agreement between the parties on the amount of compensation, and that the government's obligation to pay just compensation is not diminished by an agreement on the amount. However, in this case, the parties did not reach an agreement on the amount of compensation, and the government's offer to purchase the land was not accepted.

Based on the foregoing, the court finds that the government's motion to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is without merit, and that the verdict of the jury is supported by the evidence. The court hereby denies the government's motion and affirms the verdict of the jury.

gold_text: The court does not think that the parties reached any agreement as to the amount that should be paid for just compensation, and certainly the plaintiff did not feel that a valid agreement had been entered into, else it would have filed an amendment to the declaration of taking and the complaint and alleged that an agreement fixing just compensation had been entered into. Such procedure is recognized and has been approved. See, Danforth v. United States, 308 U.S. 271, 60 S.Ct. 231, 84 L.Ed. 240; Wachovia Bank & Trust Co., v.
