In this case, MD Helicopters Inc. (MDHI) moves for summary judgment on Scott's negligence claim. MDHI argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because Scott's claim is based on a regulatory duty to provide instructions for continued airworthiness, which is not a duty recognized in Florida law. MDHI also argues that even if it did have a duty, it did not breach that duty and that any breach was not the proximate cause of the accident.

Scott responds that MDHI did have a duty to provide instructions for continued airworthiness and that it breached that duty by failing to do so. Scott argues that the duty to provide instructions for continued airworthiness is a regulatory duty recognized in federal aviation regulations and that MDHI was aware of this duty.

The court finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether MDHI had a duty to provide instructions for continued airworthiness and whether it breached that duty. The court also finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether MDHI's alleged breach of duty was the proximate cause of the accident.

In reaching this decision, the court relies on the Supreme Court's decision in Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U.S. 500 (1988), which holds that a contractor's liability for a design defect in military equipment is governed by the government contractor defense. The court also relies on the Eleventh Circuit's decision in Smith v. Xerox Corp., 916 F.2d 977 (1990), which holds that a contractor's liability for a design defect in a product is governed by the government contractor defense.

Therefore, the court grants MDHI's motion for summary judgment in part and denies it in part. The court finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether MDHI had a duty to provide instructions for continued airworthiness and whether it breached that duty, and therefore denies MDHI's motion for summary judgment on those issues. The court also finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether MDHI's alleged breach of duty was the proximate cause of the accident, and therefore denies MDHI's motion for summary judgment on that issue.

gold_text: Finally, MDHI argues that Scott’s claims are barred by the government contractor defense, which preempts state tort law where “unique federal interests” are implicated. (Doc. # 118 at 16). The government contractor defense includes three conditions as set forth in Boyle v. United Tech. Corp., 487 U.S. 500, 512, 108 S.Ct. 2510, 101 L.Ed.2d 442 (1988): “(1) the United States approved reasonably precise specifications; (2) the equipment conformed to those specifications; and (3) the supplier warned the United States about the dangers in the use of the equipment that were known to the supplier but not to the United States.” The defense extends to military surplus helicopters converted to civilian use. See e.g. Skyline Air Svc., Inc. v. G.L. Capps Co., 916 F.2d 977, 978 (5th Cir.1990) (finding the defense applicable to such a helicopter).
