The appellants argue that the showup in the Southfield Police Station was impermissibly suggestive, thus violating due process. However, this claim must be considered within the established judicial framework. In reference case 449 F.2d 1026, the court held that a showup near the time and place of the crime does not inherently violate due process absent special elements of unfairness. Similarly, reference case 405 F.2d 1104 supports the view that prompt identifications, especially when aligned with fresh observations, promote fairness and reliability.

Furthermore, reference case 408 F.2d 1280 indicated that the risk of suggestiveness during a showup does not automatically infringe upon due process, particularly when countervailing factors ensure fairness. The timing of the identification, less than 90 minutes post-incident, aligns with the acceptable standards established in the aforementioned cases.

Lastly, the principles highlighted in reference case 383 F.2d 206 affirm the importance of immediate confrontations at or near the crime scene to enhance identification accuracy and corroborate the reliability of witness testimonies. Given the circumstances and the District Judge's balanced consideration of the facts, we find no due process violation in the conducted showups.

The Michigan Court of Appeals' finding is consistent with these precedents, affirming that the lineups carried out were not unduly suggestive under the specific circumstances.
