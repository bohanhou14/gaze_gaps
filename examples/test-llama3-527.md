As a chatbot, I will provide a concise and concise answer based on the provided reference cases. Here is the answer:

The case at hand involves a complaint filed by Liu against U-Haul under Massachusetts General Laws ch. 93A, alleging that U-Haul's attempted price-fixing scheme caused her to pay at least 10 percent more for two one-way truck rentals than she would have absent U-Haul's unlawful action. The district court dismissed the complaint, finding that Liu had failed to plausibly allege an injury.

In Twombly and Iqbal, the Supreme Court established the standard for pleading a claim under Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, requiring a complaint to contain "factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." 550 U.S. 544 (2007); 556 U.S. 662 (2009). The complaint in this case sufficiently alleges an attempt to fix prices and raises a plausible inference that U-Haul's actions caused Liu to pay a higher price for her rental.

The district court's dismissal was also based on the lack of an adequate allegation of harm. However, the complaint provides sufficient detail to show damages, including the alleged price increases and the FTC's allegations of U-Haul's attempts to collude with Budget. The case is remanded for further proceedings.

In conclusion, the complaint in this case adequately pleads a claim under chapter 93A and raises a plausible inference that U-Haul's actions caused Liu to pay a higher price for her rental. The district court's dismissal was incorrect, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
