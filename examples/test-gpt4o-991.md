In Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967), the Supreme Court articulated the standard of qualified immunity that shields police officers from liability under § 1983, provided they act in good faith and with probable cause. This case is seminal in establishing that the officer's belief in the lawfulness of their actions must be both subjectively in good faith and objectively reasonable. Similarly, the case of Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961), emphasized that actions taken "under color of" state law form the basis for § 1983 claims, but it did not address immunity specifically.

Applying these precedents, it is clear that the defendants in the current case cannot evade liability simply by citing good faith. The statutory requirements of Municipal Code, section 193-l(d), explicitly necessitate the presence of three or more individuals engaging in disorderly conduct — a criterion unmet as admitted by the defendants. Given such facts, the defendants' belief in the validity of the arrest lacks the requisite objective reasonableness, irrespective of their subjective intent.

Accordingly, the defendants fail to fulfill the dual criteria of qualified immunity as emphasized in both Pierson and Monroe. Therefore, as a matter of law, summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, Hartnett and Kozlowski, is warranted. The defendants’ inability to demonstrate a reasonable belief in the validity of the arrests negates the need for further inquiry into their state of mind, warranting the conclusion that they acted beyond their legal bounds under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
