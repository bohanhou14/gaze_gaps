The defendants also contend that the plaintiffs' individual damage claims will necessitate numerous "mini-trials," complicating the proceedings unduly. In response, it is crucial to consider the purpose and application of Rule 23(b)(3). As established in 286 F.2d 631, fairness and considerations of convenience and economy demand that interconnected claims be litigated collectively, avoiding substantial duplication of effort and time. This perspective is integral to managing complex litigation efficiently. 

Additionally, in accordance with 426 F.2d 709, the presence of common factual and legal questions related to the plaintiffs' claims signifies that these issues should be resolved in a unified proceeding. The defendants' assertion, that individualized damage assessments outweigh the benefits of a class action, fails to acknowledge that the primary inquiry — liability rooted in an alleged conspiracy — remains central and collective. This aligns with the principle that counterclaims bearing a "logical relationship" to the main claim should be addressed jointly to prevent piecemeal litigation.

Moreover, under the scrutiny of 430 F.2d 1077, it is evident that managing discovery and damages collectively under the class action umbrella, despite its challenges, is not rendered impractical or unfair. The collective resolution method remains the superior and necessary mechanism to afford all potential class members an opportunity for redress.

Therefore, I find that the plaintiffs have met the Rule 23(b)(3) requirements, affirming that common questions predominate and a class action is superior in this context.

gold_text: The defendants also contend that thousands of the class members will be customers whose accounts are delinquent, and who will therefore be subject to counterclaims by one or more of the defendants. As to those class members, the defendants argue, the presentation of counterclaims and defenses thereto will require “mini-trials,” and will render the damages phase of this case utterly unmanageable. I cannot accept this contention. Assuming arguendo that an absent class member is an “opposing party,” Fed.R.Civ.P. 13, against whom a counterclaim may be asserted, it appears at this point that any claims based on delinquent accounts would be permissive, rather than compulsory, counterclaims. See Great Lakes Rubber Corp. v. Herbert Cooper Co., 286 F.2d 631, 634 (3d Cir. 1961) (counterclaim is compulsory only where “separate trials on each of [the opposing parties’] respective claims would involve a substantial duplication of effort and time”). A district court may not, of course, entertain a permissive counterclaim unless an independent jurisdictional basis for it exists. E. g., United States v. Heyward-Robinson Co., 430 F.2d 1077, 1080 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1021, 91 S.Ct. 582, 27 L.Ed.2d 632 (1971); Revere Copper & Brass, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 426 F.2d 709, 714 (5th Cir. 1970). Thus, the only counterclaims that I could hear in this case would be those that involved (1) an amount in excess of $10,000, and (2) a defendant and a class member of diverse citizenship. 28 U.S.C.A. § 1332(a)(1) (Supp.1977). Counterclaims that satisfy both requirements will, in all likelihood, be so few as to present no serious impediment to the management of this class action.
