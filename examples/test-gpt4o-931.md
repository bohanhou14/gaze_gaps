Summary judgment is appropriate under Rule 56(c) when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law (477 U.S. 317). The burden initially lies with the moving party to demonstrate the absence of a material fact issue through affidavits or other materials (56 F.3d 542). The standard for summary judgment aligns with that of a directed verdict (477 U.S. 317). In the context of Gerber's claims, to survive summary judgment, she must demonstrate specific, material facts that create a genuine issue for trial (56 F.3d 542). However, in this case, Gerber's allegations, even if taken as true, do not establish a federal cause of action under EMTALA. The evidence does not demonstrate that Northwest Hospital Center breached its statutory duties for medical screening or stabilization in a manner that suggests disparate treatment or failure to stabilize an identified emergency condition (477 U.S. 242). Therefore, the defendants' motions for summary judgment should be granted.
