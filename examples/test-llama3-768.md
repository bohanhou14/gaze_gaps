Plaintiffs in KRUPANSKY v. COLLINS, et al., 605 F.Supp. 802 (M.D.Tenn.1985), appealed the district court's dismissal of their civil rights action challenging the validity of the Tennessee statute disenfranchising convicted felons. The Natural Rights Center, a public interest organization, and Charles Wesley, an adult black citizen of Tennessee, claimed that the Tennessee Act violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1982.

The Supreme Court's decision in Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24 (1974), established that a state has the power to disenfranchise persons convicted of felonies. Similarly, in Green v. Board of Elections of City of New York, 380 F.2d 445 (2d Cir.1967), the court recognized that a state may disenfranchise felons because they have committed a crime and assume the risks of detention and punishment.

The plaintiffs also claimed that the Tennessee Act violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1982, which prohibits states from imposing voting qualifications or prerequisites that result in the denial or abridgement of the right to vote on account of race or color. However, the court held that the Tennessee Act did not violate Section 2 because it did not deny any citizen, ab initio, the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect candidates of their choice. Rather, the act only disenfranchises individuals who have committed a preascertained, proscribed act.

In addition, the court rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the Tennessee Act violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because there was no evidence of racial discrimination in the passage of the act. The court noted that the Tennessee legislature's intent in enacting the disenfranchisement statute was not to discriminate against blacks, but rather to disenfranchise individuals who have committed a serious crime.

The district court's decision was affirmed, and the plaintiffs' appeal was denied. The court concluded that the Tennessee Act did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1982 because it did not deny any citizen, ab initio, the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect candidates of their choice. The court also rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the Tennessee Act was enacted with
