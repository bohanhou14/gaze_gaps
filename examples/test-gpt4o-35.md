III. CREDIBILITY DETERMINATIONS

Plaintiff argues that the ALJ’s assessment of her credibility regarding the extent of her impairments and their impact on her ability to work is flawed. The ALJ determined that Plaintiff's complaints were not entirely credible, especially regarding the severity of her pain and the side effects of her medications. It is well-established that credibility findings by an ALJ are entitled to deference and will not be disturbed unless “patently wrong.” See Anderson v. Sullivan, 925 F.2d 220, 222 (7th Cir.1991) and Stuckey v. Sullivan, 881 F.2d 506 (7th Cir.1989).

In 858 F.2d 1295, the court emphasized that an ALJ’s credibility determination must be supported by substantial evidence. Here, the ALJ considered multiple factors in evaluating Plaintiff's credibility: medical evidence did not demonstrate a condition expected to cause the alleged degree of pain, and Plaintiff's activities suggested a higher functional capacity than claimed. Similar to the findings in 985 F.2d 334, the ALJ noted inconsistencies between Plaintiff's reported limitations and observed activities.

The ALJ’s decision aligns with precedent that ALJ credibility determinations are supported if based on objective evidence and multifactor analysis. Thus, the ALJ’s credibility finding is affirmed, as it is not patently wrong and is backed by substantial evidence from the record.

CONCLUSION

For the reasons discussed, the Commissioner’s decision is affirmed, and Plaintiff’s motion for remand is denied.
