The legal cases referenced in the writeup show that punitive damages are not dischargeable under § 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code. In Re Miera, 926 F.2d 741 (8th Cir.1991), and In Re McGuffey, 145 B.R. 582 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1992), punitive damages were held to be non-dischargeable under § 523(a)(6). The court in Miera considered the conduct giving rise to the punitive damages and held that if it was the same conduct that gave rise to the non-dischargeable debt under § 523(a)(6), both were non-dischargeable. In Re Dean, 79 B.R. 659 (Bankr. N.D.Tex.1987), the court also held that punitive damages were non-dischargeable under § 523(a)(6).

In contrast, some courts have held that punitive damages are dischargeable under § 523(a)(2)(A). In Re Ellwanger, 105 B.R. 551, 556 (9th Cir. BAP 1989), the court held that punitive damages were dischargeable under § 523(a)(2)(A). However, this decision was based on a faulty interpretation of the statute, and the court ultimately reversed its decision in In Re Palmer, 991 F.2d 672 (9th Cir.1993).

In conclusion, the legal cases referenced in the writeup show that punitive damages are not dischargeable under § 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code. The courts have consistently held that punitive damages are non-dischargeable under § 523(a)(6), and there is no basis for excluding punitive damages from non-dischargeable debts.

gold_text: Applying a similar statutory construction under § 523(a)(2)(A) several courts have concluded that punitive damages are dischargeable. In re Levy, 951 F.2d 196 (9th Cir.1991); Matter ofSuter, 59 B.R. 944, 946-47 (Bankr.N.D.I11.1986) (Ginsberg, J.); Matter of Larson, 79 B.R. 462, 465 (Bankr. W.D.Mo.1987). These courts reason that the phrase in § 523(a)(2) — “to the extent obtained by” — modifies and limits the amount of non-dischargeable damages to the amount the debtor obtained as a result of the fraud. Levy at 198; Suter at 946. A few courts have, however, found punitive damages non-dischargeable under § 523(a)(2) notwithstanding the statutory limitation. See In re St. Laurent II, 991 F.2d 672, 678 (11th Cir. 1993) (“punitive damage awards flowing from the same course of fraudulent conduct necessitating an award of compensatory damages are not dischargeable in bankruptcy under § 523(a)(2)(A)); In re Pawlinski, 170 B.R. 380 (Bankr.N.D.I11.1994) (punitive damages arising from non-dischargeable debt under § 523(a)(2)(A) or § 523(a)(4) are non-dis-chargeable). This court agrees with the majority view that the express language of the statute limits the non-dischargeable debt to only that amount actually obtained by the fraud and not to punitive damages imposed because of the fraud.
