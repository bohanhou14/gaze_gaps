In the context of the legal cases provided, it is clear that the arbitrability of the issue is a crucial factor in determining the outcome. In Reference case 133 F.3d 141, the court held that where issues brought before a court are arbitrable, the court shall "stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the [arbitration] agreement." Similarly, in Reference case 619 F.3d 67, the court emphasized that a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.

In the present case, the 2009 agreement contains a clause that requires any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the agreement, or the breach thereof, to be determined by arbitration. The agreement also specifies that the arbitrators shall issue a reasoned award, and it shall be final and binding upon the parties. Given the breadth of the arbitration clause, it is clear that the dispute between FJO and MCI is arbitrable.

In light of the above, the Court GRANTS MCI's motion to compel arbitration and DISMISSES the case without prejudice. The arbitrators shall have the authority to hear and decide the dispute between the parties, and their decision shall be final and binding.

It is worth noting that the duress claim raised by FJO is not specifically directed at the arbitration clause, but rather at the validity of the entire 2009 agreement. Therefore, the arbitrators shall have the authority to decide the validity of the agreement, including the arbitration clause, in the first instance. This decision is supported by the Supreme Court's ruling in Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 126 S.Ct. 1204, 163 L.Ed.2d 1038 (2006), which held that a challenge to the validity of the contract as a whole, and not specifically to the arbitration clause, must go to the arbitrator.

In conclusion, the arbitrability of the issue is a crucial factor in determining the outcome of this case. The Court finds that the dispute between FJO and MCI is arbitrable, and therefore GRANTS MCI's motion to compel arbitration and DISMISSES the case without prejudice. The arbitrators shall have the authority to hear and decide the dispute between the parties, and their decision shall be final and binding. </answer
