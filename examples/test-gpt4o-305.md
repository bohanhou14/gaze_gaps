The district court emphasized that the considerations for recognizing foreign judgments in the United States were derived from Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, and similar cases. Central to this doctrine is that a judgment rendered by a competent foreign court, after due process, is prima facie evidence of the matters adjudged unless proven otherwise by specific grounds such as fraud or prejudice. This aligns with principles shared in reference case 544 F.2d 624 regarding the enforceability of judgments where jurisdiction and due process are established.

The district court further evaluated the evidence proffered by the defendant to demonstrate fraud and found it lacking. None of the letters, admissions, or newspaper articles provided substantive proof that the Indian regulations rendered the contract illegal or suggested fraud. This stance is consistent with findings in 458 F.2d 255, which underscores the importance of credible evidence in supporting claims, such as those of misrepresentation or fraud.

Moreover, addressing the defendantâ€™s invocation of the Bretton Woods Agreement, the district court maintained that this international treaty's applicability must be clearly pertinent and was dismissed due to jurisdictional inadequacies, similar to notions discussed in 376 U.S. 398 about sovereign authority and the application of foreign laws within U.S. courts.

Thus, the appellate court affirmed the district court's finding, upholding the enforcement of the Australian judgment while reiterating that genuine issues of material fact regarding alleged fraud were not satisfactorily established.
