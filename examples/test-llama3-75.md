The automatic stay provision in 11 U.S.C. § 362(a) only applies to the bankrupt debtor, not its solvent co-defendants. As stated in Royal Truck and Trailer, Inc. v. Armadora Maritima Salvadorena, S.A. de C.V., 10 B.R. 488 (N.D.Ill.1981), and In re Carib-Inn of San Juan, Corp., Case No. B-81-00273(B) (Order filed April 12, 1982), the automatic stay does not protect nondebtor parties. Therefore, the action against Mather cannot be dismissed based on the automatic stay.

The court also finds that Mather is personally liable for the torts he committed, regardless of his status as an agent of Resco. As stated in Al-Khazraji v. St. Francis College, 784 F.2d 505, 518 (3d Cir.1986), an individual, including a director, officer, or agent of a corporation, may be liable for injuries suffered by third parties because of his torts, regardless of whether he acted on his own account or on behalf of the corporation.

Furthermore, Mather's claim that he is not liable for matters related to the contracts between Metromedia and Resco and Ernst is without merit. As stated in 15 U.S.C.A. §§ 1114, 1125(a) (West 1963 & Supp.1994), any individual may be liable for trademark infringement or unfair competition under the Lanham Act, regardless of any contractual relationship.

In conclusion, the court finds that Mather is personally liable for the torts he committed and that the action against him cannot be dismissed based on the automatic stay or the lack of a contractual relationship. The court will deny Mather's motion to dismiss.

gold_text: With certain exceptions, 11 U.S.C.A. § 362 (West 1993) automatically stays “commencement or continuation” of any judicial proceeding against a debtor that was or could have been brought before the commencement of the debtor’s bankruptcy case. The automatic stay of the bankruptcy court, however, does not divest the court of “jurisdiction to hear every claim that is in any way related to the bankruptcy proceeding.” In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 994 F.2d 956, 969 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Picco v. Global Marine Drilling Co., 900 F.2d 846, 850 (5th Cir.1990)). Metrome-dia’s action for trademark infringement, unfair competition, breach of contract and breach of promissory note against Resco is a “proceeding against the debtor” and subject to the automatic stay. See 11 U.S.C.A. § 362(a). Mather, however, is not affected by the automatic stay because he is not a debtor in bankruptcy. See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 994 F.2d at 969 (citing Austin v. Unarco Indus., Inc., 705 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1983)); In re Supermercado Gamboa, Inc., 68 B.R. 230, 231 (Bankr.D.P.R.1986) (section 362 ordinarily does not stay an action against the officers or shareholders of a debtor-corporation).
