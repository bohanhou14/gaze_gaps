Moreover, Lufthansa's reliance on procedural hurdles to delay discovery cannot stand. The U.S. Supreme Court has long discarded the notion that mere objections or procedural technicalities can preclude rightful discovery, as seen in 329 U.S. 495, which firmly established the principle that discovery is a mutual process and not a one-way proposition. The Court there emphasized the necessity for mutual knowledge of relevant facts amongst parties to ensure fair adjudication.

Similarly, the principles outlined in 437 U.S. 340 underscore that discovery obligations should be performed by the party to whom the task is more efficiently suited, and that the burden of discovery should align with the potential benefitee of the information. Here, Lufthansa's attempt to shift the onus and costs of discovery documentation onto Laker is unfounded, as the task could be more efficiently performed by Lufthansa itself.

In light of these precedents and Lufthansa's ongoing failure to comply with reasonable discovery requests, the Court expects prompt action. Lufthansa must proceed with necessary applications to the German Ministry and undertake all reasonable measures to facilitate compliance, as any further resistance may result in sanctions per Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

In view of the procedural posture and to promote judicial efficiency, the Court will permit the extension requested by the plaintiff. Lufthansa's attempts to invoke protections under international conventions and procedural technicalities do not outweigh the need for full and fair discovery in accordance with U.S. legal standards and precedents, specifically noted in the aforementioned cases.

gold_text: . Lufthansa also complains that plaintiffs requests are overly broad and burdensome and that they seek irrelevant information. These boilerplate objections entirely lack merit. See generally, Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 507, 67 S.Ct. 385, 391, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947); Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 351, 98 S.Ct. 2380, 2389, 57 L.Ed.2d 253 (1978); 4A Moore’s Federal Practice ¶ 33.27, pp. 33-164 et seq. There is likewise no merit to specific objections made regarding the depositions of Reinhardt Abraham, Lufthansa’s vice chairman, and Herbert Culman, its former chairman.
