**Generation:**

Certainly, an essential determinant in trademark infringement analysis is the likelihood of consumer confusion. In trademark disputes, actual confusion need not be proven; instead, a likelihood of confusion suffices (595 F.2d 1194). ACBC and Oregon Breakers have stipulated no material differences between black and gray circuit breakers except for casing color. This similarity is unlikely to result in consumer confusion absent material differences (982 F.2d 633).

Moreover, the Ninth Circuit provides a comprehensive framework to evaluate consumer confusion likelihood, aptly illustrated by Sleekcraft factors (174 F.3d 1036). These factors encompass similarity of marks, marketing channels, and buyer care, among others. In this context, neither the expansion of product lines nor purchaser care shows significant variance to affect our conclusion (174 F.3d 1036). Also, public deception due to mark similarity stands as the overarching test under § 1125(a) (595 F.2d 1194).

In conclusion, the district court did not err in its summary judgment given the apparent lack of material differences and consumer confusion evidence. Therefore, we concur with the lower court’s decision to dismiss ACBC’s claims.

gold_text: In the end, whether this is technically classified as a gray market case or not does not drive the solution. Ultimately, what is at issue is whether there is a likelihood of confusion as to source under the well established precedent of §§ 32 and 4B(a) of the Lanham Act. Neither Katzel nor K Mart preclude a finding of trademark infringement as a matter of law in this context. As McCarthy notes, “the ultimate issue in a trademark infringement suit against the importer of gray market imports is the factual question of likelihood of confusion of U.S. customers.” McCarthy, supra, § 29.46; see Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entm’t Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1053 (9th Cir.1999) (“The core element of trademark infringement is the likelihood of confusion, i.e., whether the similarity of the marks is likely to confuse customers about the source of the products.”) (citations omitted); New West Corp. v. NYM Co., 595 F.2d 1194, 1201 (9th Cir.1979) (“Whether we call the violation infringement, unfair competition or false designation of origin, the test is identical is there a ‘likelihood of confusion?’ ”); see also Societe Des Produits Nestle v. Casa Helvetia, Inc., 982 F.2d 633, 640 (1st Cir.1992) (“Whether the fulcrum of plaintiffs’ complaint is perceived as section 32(l)(a), section 42, or section 43(a), liability necessarily turns on the existence vel non of material differences between the products of a sort likely to create consumer confusion.”).
