In light of the provided reference cases, we can analyze the issues presented. Firstly, the case at hand involves the sale of a dwelling house and lot, with the petitioners retaining their former dwelling house and moving it to a new location. The issue arises whether the gain realized on the sale of the subjacent land alone of the premises A, without the old dwelling, qualifies for nonrecognition under section 1034(a).

Reference case 33 T.C. 1 suggests that a demolition loss is limited to the adjusted basis of the property at the time of its destruction. Similarly, in this case, the petitioners sold the subjacent land alone, without the old dwelling, which was moved to a new location. Therefore, the gain realized on the sale of the subjacent land alone does not qualify for nonrecognition under section 1034(a).

Reference case 12 T.C. 659 emphasizes the importance of considering the purpose of an expenditure. In this case, the petitioners spent $5,935.18 to move their former dwelling from premises A to premises C. This expenditure was primarily to bring about an improvement in reception for the listeners to the petitioner’s radio station, rather than to sell the subjacent land alone. Therefore, this expenditure should be treated as a capital expenditure which should be added to the basis of the dwelling.

In conclusion, based on the reference cases, we find that the gain realized on the sale of the subjacent land alone of premises A, without the old dwelling, does not qualify for nonrecognition under section 1034(a). Additionally, the expenditure of $5,935.18 to move the petitioners’ former dwelling from premises A to premises C should be treated as a capital expenditure which should be added to the basis of the dwelling.
