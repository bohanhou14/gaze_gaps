As established in the Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen case (304 U.S. 307), the tax was identified as a gross receipts tax rather than a privilege or franchise tax. This precedent is vital to understanding the current case's taxable event, which aligns with the interpretation that gross receipts are the focal point of taxation. Defendants' argument that the taxable event is the privilege of doing business within Indiana does not hold since the Supreme Court has previously clarified that such taxes should be on gross receipts from commerce.

Additionally, the principle of apportionment is well-supported in previous cases such as Gwin, White & Prince Inc. v. Henneford (305 U.S. 434), where the Supreme Court underscored the necessity of allocating taxes proportionately to the business activities conducted within and outside the taxing state. In the current case, significant portions of the transactions occurred outside Indiana, necessitating an apportionment of income, aligning with the principles upheld in Gwin, White & Prince Inc.

Further, under the commerce clause, the imposition of a gross income tax on activities integral to interstate commerce is a direct burden and hence invalid, as established in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue (303 U.S. 250). Since the ties were transported across state lines, the activities undeniably constitute interstate commerce, thus rendering the Indiana tax a constitutional violation.

In conclusion, as informed by these precedents, the Indiana Gross Income Tax Act's application in this case is unconstitutional without proper apportionment and due to its burden on interstate commerce.

gold_text: We reach the conclusion that the transactions in question were had in interstate commerce. It does not always follow, however, that interstate commerce is immune from taxation. Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U.S. 250, 254, 255, 58 S.Ct. 546, 82 L.Ed. 823, 115 A.L.R. 944; Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 305 U.S. 434, 438, 59 S.Ct. 325, 83 L.Ed. 272. Both of these cases, however, stand for the rule often announced, that state taxation, whatever its form, is precluded if it discriminates against interstate commerce.
