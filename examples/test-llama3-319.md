In reviewing the legal cases, it is essential to consider the exhaustion of military remedies. As stated in Ex parte Kusweski, D.C., 251 F. 977, and U. S. v. Sing Tack, 194 U.S. 161, 24 S.Ct. 621, 48 L.Ed. 917, the policy underlying the requirement of exhaustion of state remedies applies with equal force to attacks upon the propriety of military confinement.

In the case of Ex parte Hawk, 321 H.S. 114, 64 S.Ct. 448, 88 L.Ed. 572, it was held that a ruling on a question by the Judge Advocate General, adverse to a petitioner's contention, would be subject to review. Similarly, in the case of Johnson v. Hoy, 227 U.S. 245, 33 S.Ct. 240, 57 L.Ed. 497, it was held that the provision of Article 53 which makes the judgment and findings of the Judge Advocate General binding upon all departments, courts, agencies, and officers of the United States, is void because it attempts to deprive the courts of jurisdiction to review the same.

In the case of Noyd v. Bond, the petitioner, Dale E. Noyd, was convicted by a general court-martial of violating Article 90 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. He was sentenced to dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for one year at hard labor. The general court-martial convening authority approved the conviction and ordered Noyd removed to the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, pending completion of military appellate review.

The district court determined that to allow the transfer to Fort Leavenworth would be tantamount to an execution of the sentence prior to the completion of military review procedures, which is prohibited by Article 71(c) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The court therefore decreed that Noyd be relieved from the transfer order and be placed under guard and restricted to a room in the Visiting Officers' Quarters at Cannon Air Force Base.

The same principle applies to the cases of 314 F.2d 858 and 179 F.2d 661, where the courts held that habeas corpus is not available to review military confinement until after all remedies afforded by the Uniform Code of Military Justice have first
