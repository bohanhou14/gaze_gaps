The court finds that Defendant Bartell Industries, Inc. did not violate the Lanham Act as alleged by Plaintiff Allen Engineering Corporation. The Lanham Act prohibits false advertising and misrepresentations that are likely to cause confusion as to the origin of goods or services. In this case, there is no evidence to suggest that Bartell's advertising or marketing activities were false or misleading.

In fact, the court notes that the Lanham Act requires a showing of likely confusion, which is not present in this case. The court finds that the products sold by Bartell and Allen are distinct and can be easily distinguished by consumers.

The court also notes that the Lanham Act is intended to protect consumers from false or misleading advertising, not to protect competitors from competition. In this case, Bartell is merely competing with Allen in the market, and there is no evidence to suggest that Bartell's actions were unfair or deceptive.

In conclusion, the court finds that Defendant Bartell Industries, Inc. did not violate the Lanham Act as alleged by Plaintiff Allen Engineering Corporation.
