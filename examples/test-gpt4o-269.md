The Supreme Court has consistently held that federal contractors do not enjoy blanket immunity from state taxation unless Congress explicitly provides such immunity. In Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U.S. 1 (1941), the Court upheld a state sales tax on purchases made by a government contractor despite the ultimate financial burden falling on the federal government. The Court emphasized that the tax’s legal incidence was on the contractor and not the government, thereby precluding immunity based solely on economic impact.

Subsequent cases, including United States v. Township of Muskegon, 355 U.S. 484 (1958) and City of Detroit v. Murray Corp., 355 U.S. 489 (1958), reinforced this principle by rejecting claims of immunity where the contractors operated primarily for their own benefit and not as integral parts of the federal government. Both cases underscore the necessity of clear congressional intent to confer such immunity.

United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S. 39 (1964), further delineated the boundaries of this doctrine by ruling that AEC contractors were not immune from state use taxes, despite their close operational ties to the federal government. The Court stressed that immunity could not hinge on contract specifics or formal labels but must reflect substantial governmental involvement.

Given these precedents, it is clear that unless the contractual relationship unmistakably establishes that the contractor operates as a direct governmental agent, as outlined in Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, 347 U.S. 110 (1954), state taxes on such contractors are permissible. These cases collectively illustrate the judiciary's deference to congressional authority in determining the scope of intergovernmental tax immunity.

gold_text: . It has been argued that tax immunity may be conferred only by the legislative branch. See L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 399^101 (1978). This deference to Congress is amply supported by language in leading cases. See, e. g., United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S. 39, 51, 84 S.Ct. 1518, 1525, 12 L.Ed.2d 713 (1964); City of Detroit v. Murray Corp., 355 U.S. 489, 495, 78 S.Ct. 458, 461, 2 L.Ed.2d 441 (1958). We agree that Congress is best able to adjust tax burdens, but we cannot ignore the power given to executive agencies to create relationships through contract. Although we are skeptical of cosmetic provisions drafted by government functionaries, we must find immunity when these contracts inherently and inexorably draw a private corporation so close to the government as to make it a servant. See United States v. Forst, 442 F.Supp. 920, 924-25 (W.D. Va.1977), aff’d, 569 F.2d 811 (4th Cir. 1978).
