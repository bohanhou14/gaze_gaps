The cases 511 F.2d 1270 and 500 F.2d 925 highlight the importance of providing written narrative statements of reasons for denying parole to prisoners. In 511 F.2d 1270, the District Court ordered the Parole Board to provide written statements of reasons to prisoners whose applications for parole are acted upon and not granted. The court found that the Board's failure to provide such statements resulted in a substantial danger that parole decisions were made without reasoned consideration of the relevant facts.

Similarly, in 500 F.2d 925, the court held that a prisoner is entitled to a written statement of reasons for denying parole. The court noted that 34 states gave reasons to inmates either in writing or orally upon the denial of parole, and that detailed findings of fact are not required, provided the Board's decision is based on consideration of all relevant factors and furnishes to the inmate both the grounds for the decision and the essential facts upon which the Board's inferences are based.

In the case at hand, the Parole Board's decision to continue the plaintiff in confinement for 57 months without further review is insufficient. The reasons given by the Board do not support the length of the continuance ordered, and the reference to the guidelines is unclear as the Board does not provide specific ranges for offenses of the "greatest" severity. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.

gold_text: Courts granting relief to prisoners who have been denied parole without receiving any statement of the reasons for denial have typically ordered only a statement of the reasons for denial as a remedy. See, e. g., Childs v. United States Board of Parole, 511 F.2d 1270, 1272 (D.C.Cir. 1974); Soloway v. Weger, 389 F.Supp. 409, 412 (D.Minn.1974); United States ex rel. Johnson v. Chairman of the New York State Board of Parole, 363 F.Supp. 416, 419 (E.D.N.Y.1973), aff’d 500 F.2d 925 (2d Cir.), vacated as moot, 419 U.S. 1015, 95 S.Ct. 488, 42 L.Ed.2d 289 (1974); but see, Craft v. Attorney General of the United States, 379 F.Supp. 538 (M.D.Pa.1974). On the other hand, courts granting relief on the ground that the reasons given for the denial of parole suggest that the decision to deny may have been reached arbitrarily typically order a new hearing. See Diaz v. Norton, supra, at 115—16; Lupo v. Norton, 371 F.Supp. 156, 164 (D.Conn.1974).
