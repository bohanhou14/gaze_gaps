In the context of reopening Miss Fowler’s 1968 claim, relevant precedent supports such a measure due to administrative errors. Specifically, in 514 F.2d 561, the court allowed reopening where evidence revealed a clear error on the face of the record. The similarities with Mrs. Lauritzen's case are striking; both involved overlooked evidence and procedural errors. Moreover, 527 F.2d 224 further emphasizes that initial, revised, or reconsidered claims may be reopened if clerical or evident errors are detected.

Applying these principles, we find the Secretary's refusal to reopen Miss Fowler’s 1968 claim to be legally unsupported. The evidence demonstrates errors that warrant reconsideration, thus fitting within the regulatory framework as outlined in the reference cases. Consequently, we remand the case to the Secretary for a substantive review of the 1968 claim, ensuring compliance with the established legal standards set forth in the cases of 514 F.2d 561 and 527 F.2d 224.

gold_text: 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8) provides that a final decision may be reopened at any time “for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.” As the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said in Lauritzen v. Wein-berger, 514 F.2d 561, 563 (8th Cir. 1975), the question for the Social Security Administration on any claim for reopening is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, or whether there is manifest error in the record. This inquiry, in opting for a flexible approach to the doctrine of res judicata, supports the view expressed by this court in Coulter v. Weinberger, 527 F.2d 224, 228 (3d Cir. 1975):
