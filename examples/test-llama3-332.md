The court must determine whether the alleged harassment by Defendant Nutt constitutes extreme and outrageous conduct, as required by Florida law. In reviewing the allegations, we must consider whether the conduct was so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all bounds of decency and be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. See Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. McCarson, 467 So.2d 277 (Fla.1985).

In this case, the alleged conduct by Defendant Nutt includes requests for sexual favors, making inappropriate sexual comments, rubbing the plaintiffs on the arms, shoulders, and waist, and engaging in offensive touching. While these allegations are disturbing, they do not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct required by Florida law. See Lay v. Roux Laboratories, Inc., 379 So.2d 451, 452 (Fla. 1st DCA1980) (although "extremely reprehensible," racially hostile misconduct did not rise to the degree of "outrageousness or atrociousness" required to sustain a claim).

The court must also consider the precedent set by the Eleventh Circuit, which has held that "a complaint need not specify in detail the precise theory giving rise to recovery. All that is required is that the defendant be on notice as to the claim being asserted against him and the grounds on which it rests." Evans v. McClain of Georgia, Inc., 131 F.3d 957, 964 n. 2 (11th Cir.1997). However, in this case, the plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress.

In conclusion, the court finds that the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against Defendant Nutt. The alleged conduct, while disturbing, does not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct required by Florida law. The court's decision is consistent with the precedent set by the Eleventh Circuit and the Florida courts.

gold_text: Indeed, precedent on the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, especially within the employment context, reveals an unwillingness by Florida courts to allow a plaintiff to proceed on this theory.
