The case of Rosenthal v. United States, 470 U.S. 1 (1985), is a significant one in the realm of criminal law. The Supreme Court ruled that the prosecutor's remarks, alone, do not necessarily deprive a defendant of a fair trial. In this case, the prosecutor's statement during rebuttal closing argument referred to the guilty plea of co-conspirator Limas, which was a key piece of evidence against Rosenthal. The Court held that the statement was permissible and did not constitute reversible error, as it was a response to Rosenthal's defense argument and did not inject new evidence into the case. The Court emphasized that the jury was instructed to follow the law and not consider extraneous information. Therefore, the Court found that the prosecutor's remark did not cast serious doubt on the correctness of the jury's verdict and did not affect Rosenthal's substantial rights.

The case is significant because it highlights the importance of balancing the need for effective prosecution with the need to ensure a fair trial. The Court's decision emphasizes that the prosecutor's role is to present evidence and argue the case, not to inject new evidence or manipulate the jury's decision. This decision has been cited in numerous subsequent cases, including United States v. Thompson, 482 F.3d 781 (5th Cir. 2007), which reiterated the importance of considering the magnitude of the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor's remarks, the efficacy of any cautionary instruction by the judge, and the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction.

In conclusion, the case of Rosenthal v. United States, 470 U.S. 1 (1985), is a landmark decision that has shaped the landscape of criminal law. The Court's ruling emphasizes the importance of fair trial procedures and the need to balance the need for effective prosecution with the need to ensure a fair trial. The case has been cited in numerous subsequent cases and continues to be an important reference in the field of criminal law.

gold_text: For the first prong of the above three-part test, in considering the magnitude of the prejudicial effect, if any, of the Government’s comments, this court examines them “in the context of the trial and attempts to ascertain their intended effect”. United States v. Virgen-Moreno, 265 F.3d 276, 291 (5th Cir.2001). Rosenthal, not the Government, had Limas’ indictment, plea agreement, and plea-packet memorandum admitted in evidence. In examining the impact of the Government’s remarks, “the reviewing court ... must also take into account defense counsel’s opening salvo.... [I]f the [Government’s] remarks were ‘invited,’ and did no more than respond substantially in order to ‘right the scale,’ such comments would not warrant reversing a conviction”. United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 12-13, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985).
