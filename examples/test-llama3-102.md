 <answer>As the court has already held that the due process claim must fail, it is unnecessary to address the issues raised by defendants with respect to the pleading standards for claims of retaliation. However, the court must consider plaintiff's claim of retaliatory confinement and dismiss it for the reasons stated below.

In evaluating claims of retaliation, a court must accept as true all factual allegations contained in the complaint. See Cohen v. Koenig, 25 F.3d 1168, 1171 (2d Cir.1994). To state a claim for retaliation, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) he engaged in protected conduct; (2) the defendant took adverse action against him; and (3) the adverse action was motivated by the defendant's desire to retaliate against the plaintiff for engaging in the protected conduct. See Franco v. Kelly, 854 F.2d 584, 589-90 (2d Cir.1988).

Plaintiff alleges that he was placed in administrative confinement in retaliation for prior complaints made about prison conditions. However, he fails to provide any specific details or facts supporting this claim. See Leon v. Murphy, 988 F.2d 303, 311 (2d Cir.1993). In the absence of any factual basis for the claim, the court cannot conclude that defendants' actions were motivated by a desire to retaliate against plaintiff for exercising his constitutional rights.

Furthermore, the court notes that plaintiff's allegations of retaliation are conclusory and lack specific details. See Flaherty v. Coughlin, 713 F.2d 10, 13 (2d Cir.1983). Conclusory allegations are insufficient to state a claim and are properly dismissed. See 105 F.3d 857, 860 (2d Cir.1997).

In light of the above, the court grants defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's retaliation claim. Plaintiff's failure to provide any specific facts or details supporting his claim, combined with the conclusory nature of his allegations, precludes the court from finding that defendants' actions were motivated by a desire to retaliate against plaintiff for exercising his constitutional rights.

The court also notes that the pleadings do not provide any evidence of a constitutional violation. See 824 F.2d 192, 194 (2d Cir.1987). As such, the court cannot conclude that plaintiff's rights were violated.

The court hereby grants

gold_text: Under Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint usually requires a “short and plain” statement of the claim. However, in the Second Circuit claims of retaliation must be pled with greater detail. See Flaherty v. Coughlin, 713 F.2d 10, 13 (2d Cir.1983). This heightened pleading standard is necessary because retaliation claims are “prone to abuse,” in that prisoners could make claims of retaliation for every administrative decision with which they did not agree. Id. If courts allowed full discovery for every claim of retaliation, the results would be chaotic. See id. Yet, some inmates do have legitimate § 1983 claims which should be heard on the merits. See id. Therefore, if a complaint creates a “colorable suspicion” of retaliation, a court should allow some discovery before determining whether a valid claim exists. See id.; Maurer v. Keane, No. 96-3273, 1996 WL 732591, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 1996). On the other hand, a court should dismiss a complaint if the allegations of retaliatory conduct are “unsupported, speculative, and conclusory.” Boddie v. Schnieder, 105 F.3d 857, 862 (2d Cir.1997); see also Gill v. Mooney, 824 F.2d 192, 194 (2d Cir.1987) (affirming grant of 12(b)(6) motion because allegations of retaliation were conclusory); Smith v. O’Connor, 901 F.Supp. 644, 649 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (granting motion to dismiss when an inmate alleged that the defendant had retaliated against him because of “an undefined ‘legal complaint’ made to a superior officer at an unspecified time”).
