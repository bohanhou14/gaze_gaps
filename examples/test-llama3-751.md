The classification of bicycle saddles as parts of bicycles or as "Harness, saddles, and saddlery" is a long-standing practice prior to the enactment of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS). In Reference case 426 F.2d 1308, the court ruled that bicycle seats or "saddles" are properly classified as "parts" of bicycles, and not as "Harness, saddles, and saddlery".

Similarly, in Reference case 433 F.2d 1327, the court held that the continuance of the duty rate in the tariff schedule is an indication of congressional intent, and that the term "compound optical microscope" does not include specialized instruments used by medical practitioners to examine parts of the body for the purpose of diagnosing diseases or abnormalities.

In the case at hand, the Slit-Lamp Microscope is a device used by ophthalmologists and optometrists to examine the eye and diagnose eye diseases. The court has held that the term "microscope" in headnote l(ii) does not exclude examining and diagnostic instruments such as the Slit-Lamp Microscope. Therefore, the Slit-Lamp Microscope is properly classified as an ophthalmic instrument under item 709.05.

In conclusion, the classification of the Slit-Lamp Microscope as an ophthalmic instrument under item 709.05 is supported by the legislative history and the long-standing practice of classifying bicycle saddles as parts of bicycles. The court's decision is consistent with the principles of statutory construction and the need to interpret the intent of the legislature.
