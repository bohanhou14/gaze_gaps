In determining the amount of attorneys' fees to award, the district court must consider the extent of success and the amount of fees awarded. In the case of a frivolous lawsuit, the court may award fees to the prevailing party, but the amount of fees awarded must be reasonable and justified by the record. 

In this case, the district court's award of $1,430 in attorneys' fees to the defendants is excessive and not supported by the record. The court failed to provide any explanation for the award, and the record does not show that the defendants' attorneys reasonably expended the time claimed. 

In Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433-36 (1983), the Supreme Court held that the extent of success is a crucial factor in determining the proper amount of an award of attorney's fees. Where a plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim, the hours spent on that claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee. 

In this case, the plaintiff's claims were clearly frivolous and barred by absolute prosecutorial immunity. The defendants' attorneys spent 22 hours on the case, but the record does not show that the time claimed was reasonably expended. The district court's award of fees was therefore excessive and not justified by the record. 

In view of the above, we remand this case to the district court for a reconsideration of the award of attorneys' fees. The district court should provide a more detailed explanation for the award and ensure that the amount of fees awarded is reasonable and justified by the record. 

It is further ordered that the award of attorneys' fees to the defendants be reduced by $9,200, as suggested by the court below. 

It is so ordered.

gold_text: While we find no fault with the district court’s determination that the amount of time spent for each task presented in defendants’ bill of costs was reasonable, the district court did not address the question whether the work was appropriately performed in the first instance. Even before Hensley, 461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), we have remanded fee decisions where the relationship between the work compensated in the award and the success of the party was not clear from the district court order. See Freeman v. Franzen, 695 F.2d 485, 494 (7th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1214, 103 S.Ct. 3553, 77 L.Ed.2d 1400 (1983); Sanchez v. Schwartz, 688 F.2d 503, 506-07 (7th Cir.1982). We must do so once again in the present case.
