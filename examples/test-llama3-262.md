In this case, the defendant, Mr. Monroe, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute more than fifty grams of cocaine base. The court accepted his plea and sentenced him to 168 months' imprisonment. Mr. Monroe later filed a motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), citing a change in the Sentencing Guidelines (Amendment 706) that reduced the base offense level for drug offenses involving cocaine base.

The issue in this case is whether Mr. Monroe's plea agreement waives his right to seek a reduction in his sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). The Government argues that the plea agreement waives Mr. Monroe's right to challenge his sentence in any collateral attack, including a motion under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). However, the Court finds that the language of the plea agreement is ambiguous and does not clearly waive Mr. Monroe's right to seek a reduction in his sentence.

In United States v. Williams, 102 F.3d 923, the Court held that a defendant's waiver of his right to appeal his sentence does not necessarily waive his right to seek a reduction in his sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). Similarly, in United States v. Chavez-Salais, 337 F.3d 1170, the Court held that a defendant's waiver of his right to bring a collateral attack does not waive his right to seek a reduction in his sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).

In this case, the Court finds that Mr. Monroe's plea agreement does not clearly waive his right to seek a reduction in his sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). Therefore, the motion to reduce his sentence is denied.

Additionally, the Court finds that Mr. Monroe is not eligible for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) because his sentence was based on the mandatory minimum sentence, rather than the sentencing range set forth in the Guidelines. This conclusion is supported by United States v. Poole, 550 F.3d 676, which held that a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) if his sentence was based on a statutory minimum sentence, rather
