In affirming the nondischargeability of both compensatory and punitive damages, the court referenced the principles established in prior decisions. Citing the case Coen v. Zick, 458 F.2d 326 (9th Cir. 1972), the court emphasized that "the statutory exception which measures nondischargeability is '...for liabilities...for willful or malicious injuries to the person or property of another'." The nature of the act leading to the liability, not the type of damages, determines nondischargeability (761 F.2d 1422).

Additionally, the court cited In re Miera, reaffirming that both compensatory and punitive damages are nondischargeable when based on identical willful and malicious conduct (171 F.3d 638). The circuit noted, “where the compensatory and punitive damage awards are based on the same underlying conduct, and the judgment for compensatory damages is nondischargeable because it is based on willful and malicious injury to another, then the punitive damages award is likewise nondischargeable” (171 F.3d 638).

Thus, the court concluded that the Missouri jury’s finding of willful fraud, which led to compensatory damages, intrinsically supported the punitive damages award, making Muegler’s debt nondischargeable under § 523(a)(2)(A).

gold_text: When the awards of compensatory damages and punitive damages are based upon the same conduct, the punitive damages award will be nondischargeable under § 523(a)(6) if the compensatory damages award is found to be nondischargeable. In re Adams, 761 F.2d 1422, 1428 (9th Cir.1985). Because the compensatory damages award is nondischargeable and the award of punitive damages was based upon the same finding of guilt, the standard for a finding of fraud under Missouri law and § 523(a)(6) are identical for the purposes of this case. See In re Scarborough, 171 F.3d 638, 644 (8th Cir.1999) (addressing an almost identical situation under Missouri law).
