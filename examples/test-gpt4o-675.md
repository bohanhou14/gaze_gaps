To determine whether the joinder of Hydrocarbons as a co-plaintiff was collusive, we can draw parallels from the case law. In *Reference case 211 U.S. 293*, the court found that a party was added collusively to invoke federal jurisdiction improperly. Similarly, in *Reference case 546 F.2d 469*, it was established that assignments made to create diversity jurisdiction are presumptively improper unless proven otherwise by legitimate business reasons.

In our case, DOE's claim that Hydrocarbons' formation and joinder was solely to establish venue aligns with the suspicion of collusion seen in both reference cases. If Hydrocarbons was formed and joined as an effort to manipulate venue, as in *Green and White Construction Co. v. Cormat Construction Co.*, 546 F.2d 469, then the venue obtained would be deemed improper. Hydrocarbons must overcome the presumption of collusion by providing substantive evidence of a legitimate business purpose unrelated to creating venue, akin to the evidentiary standard highlighted in *546 F.2d 469*.

Given these precedents, it appears that unless Hydrocarbons can provide sufficient evidence of a non-collusive and legitimate reason for its formation and joinder, the venue should be considered improperly manufactured.

gold_text: In Miller and Lux v. East Side Canal Co., 211 U.S. 293, 29 S.Ct. 111, 53 L.Ed. 189 (1908) the Supreme Court held that a predecessor statute to section 1359 precluded the district court from exercising jurisdiction because the plaintiff corporation had been collusively made a party to the action by means of a transfer of property to it by its parent corporation. The Court’s holding was based on the fact that the plaintiff’s status as a wholly owned subsidiary made the transfer of the ownership of property essentially a matter of form; and on the fact that the evidence demonstrated that the transfer was made for the sole purpose of obtaining jurisdiction.
