C. Other Proffered Reasons to Compel Discovery

Rivera's reliance on Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), and Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995) is equally unavailing. In Brady, the Supreme Court held that suppression of evidence favorable to the accused violates due process when the evidence is material to guilt or punishment. Rivera fails to demonstrate that the information regarding his transfer or custodial interrogation is material under Brady. Similarly, Giglio requires disclosure of evidence affecting the credibility of key witnesses. Here, Rivera does not identify any such evidence that would warrant disclosure. Kyles mandates the cumulative consideration of undisclosed evidence, but Rivera does not provide compelling evidence of its materiality or prejudice in this case.

Finally, under Rule 12(b)(1), Rivera's motion to compel does not meet the threshold for pretrial motions. This rule addresses defenses, objections, and requests that the Court can rule upon without a trial, not the broad discovery Rivera seeks. Consequently, Rivera's motion based on Brady, Giglio, Kyles, and Rule 12 does not justify the relief sought.

gold_text: In his motion to compel, Rivera argues in a perfunctory manner that he is entitled to the requested discovery pursuant to Rule 16, Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972), and Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). Rivera fails to establish how information concerning uncharged conduct that has no bearing on the charges the defendants face in this criminal action, and which remains under investigation, is material to the defense pursuant to Rule 16. Because the argument is undeveloped, the Court need not consider its merits. United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).
