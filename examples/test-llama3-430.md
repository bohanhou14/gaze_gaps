The legal cases referenced provide valuable insights into the interpretation of tariffs and the calculation of damages. In the case at hand, the plaintiff is seeking to recover an overcharge in the amount of $29,206.33, with interest at a rate of 6%. The defendant argues that the Commission's decision is flawed and that the Court should make its own construction of the tariff.

Reference case 236 U.S. 412 (Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co.) serves as a precedent for the Court's consideration of the tariff's construction. The Court notes that the Commission's construction of the tariff is not binding, and that the Court must make its own determination. However, the Court agrees with the Commission's construction of the tariff, finding that the plaintiff is entitled to the return of the overcharge.

Regarding the rate of interest, the Court acknowledges that interest rates have fallen in recent years. However, it declines to fix a variable rate of interest based on the prevailing rates in financial centers. Instead, it adheres to the prevailing rate of interest on overcharges, which is 6%. This decision is supported by reference case 250 U.S. 368, which notes that the Courts have allowed interest at a rate of 6% in similar cases.

In conclusion, the Court's decision is guided by the principles set forth in reference cases 236 U.S. 412 and 250 U.S. 368. The Court's interpretation of the tariff and calculation of damages are informed by these precedents, and the decision is supported by the evidence presented. The plaintiff is entitled to the return of the overcharge, with interest at a rate of 6%. <answer>
