The case involves two appeals from state court decisions in special education cases. The appeals were removed to federal court and the plaintiffs moved to remand the cases to state court. The Court must determine whether the appeals arise under federal law, and if so, whether the federal law preempt state law.

The Court notes that the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA) provides a cause of action for plaintiffs to remedy the alleged wrongs. However, the plaintiffs' claims are based on state law and do not mention federal law. The Court must analyze whether the EAHCA preempts the state law claims.

The Court references the "cooperative federalism" principle, which holds that the EAHCA sets forth minimum standards for a free, appropriate public education, and states may vary their standards to some degree as long as the minimum standards are met. The Court notes that the EAHCA does not preempt state law if the state standards at least match the minimum federal guidelines.

The Court also references San Francisco Unified School District v. State of California, 131 Cal.App.3d 54, 182 Cal.Rptr. 525 (Ct.App.1982), which held that the EAHCA appeal procedures should be followed when reviewing an administrative hearing officer's decision. The Court concludes that the EAHCA does not preempt state law in this case, as the state standards at least match the minimum federal guidelines.

The Court grants the motion to remand the cases to state court, citing Monahan v. Nebraska, 645 F.2d 592, and Burlington School Committee v. Department of Education, 471 U.S. 359. The Court notes that the federal courts have no jurisdiction over the appeals, and the state courts are better equipped to handle the specialized issues involved in special education cases.
