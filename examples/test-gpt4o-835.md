IV.

Considering the validity of Monfried’s on-the-scene identification, we find alignment with our precedent in Wise v. United States (383 F.2d 206), and the necessity of prompt identification reiterated in Russell v. United States (408 F.2d 1280). The prompt confrontation was conducted symmetrically with the principles in Stovall v. Denno (383 F.2d 1967). Despite appellant's claims of suggestibility due to the police presence and alleged distress of his sister, these elements did not render the identification impermissibly suggestive. The brief and controlled environment, coupled with prior non-identification by the store employee, underscores the reliability emphasized in Wise and Russell.

Given the compelling corroborative evidence, including Officer Innocenti's timely pursuit, matching descriptions of clothing, the discovered whiskey bottle, and Monfried’s in-court identification, any potential error in admitting Goldberg’s identification is deemed harmless beyond reasonable doubt as noted in Chapman v. California (386 U.S. 18). Thus, affirming the conviction aligns with the established jurisprudence.

So ordered.
