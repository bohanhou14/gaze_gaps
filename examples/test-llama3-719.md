In the case of Govan v. Nicholson, the veteran is appealing a decision by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) that affirmed a Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision denying his claim for an earlier effective date for a 100% disability award for a service-connected generalized anxiety disorder.

The veteran argues that the Board erred in finding that the evidence did not support a disability rating greater than 50% prior to February 25, 2002. He also alleges that the VA failed to satisfy its duty to assist by not obtaining his Social Security Administration records.

The Veterans Court concluded that the Board's determinations were not clearly erroneous and that the VA met its statutory obligation to assist the veteran in obtaining all evidence identified by him. The veteran has appealed to the court, arguing that the Veterans Court erred in its decision.

In a similar case, Heifer v. West, 174 F.3d 1332, the court held that a party to a case before the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims may obtain a review of the court's decision "with respect to the validity of any statute or regulation... or any interpretation thereof... that was relied on by the Court in making the decision." However, the court also emphasized that it only has jurisdiction to review constitutional issues and not factual determinations or the application of law to a particular set of facts.

In Govan's case, the issues presented on appeal relate to factual determinations and the application of law to the facts of the case. Therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to review these issues. The court's jurisdiction is limited to reviewing constitutional issues and the validity of statutes and regulations. As such, the court dismisses the appeal.

In further explaining this issue, Govan reiterates his contentions with respect to what the evidence shows in this case. This court must look beyond the appellant’s characterization of the issue to determine whether it falls within the jurisdiction of this court. Flores v. Nicholson, 476 F.3d 1879, 1382 (Fed.Cir. 2007); Heifer v. West, 174 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed.Cir.1999). Having reviewed Govan’s contentions, we discern no error of regulatory or statutory interpretation nor a Constitutional issue raised by his allegations.
