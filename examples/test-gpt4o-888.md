We affirm the district court's decision on Payne's claims against Pickett, Buck, and Thaler. To establish a failure-to-protect claim under § 1983, Payne must show that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his safety needs, knowing of and disregarding an excessive risk to his health or safety (see Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1979). In this case, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that Pickett, Buck, and Thaler were aware of facts from which an inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm existed and that they actually drew the inference (59 F.3d 530).

Furthermore, Payne’s allegation that Pickett, Buck, and Thaler failed to adequately investigate the grievance does not meet the standard for supervisory liability. Supervisory officials are not liable for the actions of subordinates unless they were aware of a substantial risk of serious harm (158 F.3d 908). The number of complaints filed alone does not make the failure to investigate a specific complaint an objectively reasonable response (511 U.S. 825, 844).

Given the absence of adequate evidence proving deliberate indifference and specific knowledge of the harm, summary judgment on Payne’s claims against Pickett, Buck, and Thaler is affirmed.

gold_text: To hold a supervisory official hable for the acts of a subordinate, Payne must show that “(1) the supervisor either failed to supervise or train the subordinate official; (2) a causal link exists between the failure to train or supervise and the violation of the plaintiffs rights; and (3) the failure to train or supervise amounts to deliberate indifference.” Smith v. Brenoettsy, 158 F.3d 908, 911-12 (5th Cir.1998). To state a failure to protect claim under § 1983, Payne must show that he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm and that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his need for protection. Neals v. Norwood, 59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1995). For an official to act with deliberate indifference for purposes of either claim, he “must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).
