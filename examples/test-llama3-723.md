In this case, the court is asked to determine the attorney's fee award under 42 U.S.C. § 406(b)(1) for representation in a social security case. The attorney, Carpenter, has been awarded $13,231.25, which is 25% of the past-due benefits awarded to the claimant, Hayes.

The court notes that the Social Security Act provides for a fee award under § 406(b)(1) of up to 25% of the past-due benefits, and that the Commissioner has withheld 25% of the total past-due benefits to pay an approved lawyer's fee. The court also notes that the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) provides for an award of fees to an attorney who represents a claimant in a social security case, but that the EAJA award is subject to the Social Security Act fee award.

The court finds that the fee award is reasonable under the terms of the contingency fee agreement between Hayes and Carpenter, which provides for a 25% fee of the past-due benefits. The court also finds that the fee award is reasonable under a lodestar analysis, as the court has carefully considered the time and labor expended, the novelty and difficulty of the questions raised, the skill of the attorney, and the results obtained.

The court notes that the Commissioner has approved a $4,000 attorney's fee for work performed before the administrative agency, and that the court has withheld a balance of $9,231.25 to pay an attorney's fee for work performed before the court, if approved. The court finds that the fee award is reasonable in light of the expectations of the parties, the quantum and quality of the representation, and the results achieved.

In conclusion, the court affirms the fee award of $13,231.25 to Carpenter for his representation of Hayes in this social security case. The court also notes that the attorney will be required to refund the smaller of the two fee awards, either the EAJA award or the § 406(b)(1) award, to his client, as required by the EAJA. See Weakley v. Bowen, 803 F.2d 575, 580 (10th Cir.1986) ("sufficient explanation by the district court of its reasoning and calculations will provide a record conducive to meaningful review").

gold_text: Courts have made clear that the availability of attorney’s fees under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 406, does not preclude an award of fees under the EAJA. See, e.g., Russell [v. Sullivan], 930 F.2d [1443] at 1446 [(9th Cir.1991) ]; Jankovich v. Bowen, 868 F.2d 867, 870-71 (6th Cir.1989); Weakley v. Bowen, 803 F.2d 575, § 80 (10th Cir.1986). An award of fees under the Social Security Act is deducted from the claimant’s disability benefits, whereas an EAJA award is paid separately by the government. Where fees are awarded under both provisions, the EAJA compensation therefore serves as a reimbursement to the claimant for fees paid out of the disability award. See, e.g., Jankovich, 868 F.2d at 870-71. And double recovery is prevented in that the attorney must refund the amount of the smaller fee to the claimant. Id. at 871 n. 1.
