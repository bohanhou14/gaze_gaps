As we analyze the cases, we can see that the admiralty jurisdiction is a complex and multifaceted concept. In Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A. v. Calhoun (121 F.3d 1421), the court ruled that the substantive admiralty principles are not to be supplemented by state law, especially when the case involves traditional maritime activity. Similarly, in Pogue v. Carnival Cruise Lines (912 F.2d 1355), the court emphasized the importance of notice and the imputation of notice to the shipowner.

In the case at hand, we are dealing with a riverboat casino that was moored to a pier on a navigable portion of the Des Plaines River. The plaintiff was injured when the stool she was leaning against collapsed, and she brought suit in federal district court under the admiralty law. The defendant moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that it was not within the admiralty jurisdiction.

In this case, we can see that the court's ruling is supported by the reasoning in Yamaha and Pogue. The accident occurred on a vessel afloat on navigable waters, and the injury was caused by the vessel or an object in or attached to it. This meets the requirements of the Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act (46 U.S.C.App. § 740).

Furthermore, the court's decision is consistent with the principles enunciated in St. Hilaire Moye v. Henderson (496 F.2d 973), which held that the admiralty jurisdiction is not limited to cases involving traditional maritime activity. The court's analysis also draws on the legislative history of the Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act, which shows that the Act's purpose was to clarify that accidents caused by boats on navigable waters are within the admiralty jurisdiction.

In conclusion, the court's decision is supported by the relevant case law and statutory provisions. The admiralty jurisdiction is a complex and multifaceted concept, and the court's analysis demonstrates a thorough understanding of the relevant principles and authorities. The decision is consistent with the reasoning in Yamaha and Pogue, and it applies the Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act in a sensible and coherent manner.

gold_text: We say “slightly” better because the tort principles applied to maritime accidents that as in this case mirror terrestrial accidents are similar. But this is not to deny the significance of different limitations periods and a different factfinder (judge versus jury). And while these differences are to an extent offsetting — the longer statutory period favors the plaintiff but the denial of jury trial favors the defendant — others may not be. We summa rize them briefly: (1) Nonpeeuniary damages are generally disallowed in personal-injury suits under admiralty law. Robert Force, “Tort Reform by the Judiciary: Developments in the Law of Maritime Personal Injury and Death Damages,” 23 Tulane Maritime L.J. 351, 361 (1999); see, e.g., In re Amtrack “Sunset Limited” Train Crash, 121 F.3d 1421, 1429 (11th Cir.1997). (2) A shipowner owes a uniform duty of care to everyone lawfully on board his ship, whereas some states still impose different standards of care on landowners with respect to different classes of visitors, such as business invitees and licensees. Kermarec v. Compagnie Generate Transatlantique, supra, 358 U.S. at 630, 79 S.Ct. 406; Everett v. Carnival Cruise Lines, 912 F.2d 1355, 1358 (11th Cir.1990). (3) Admiralty tort plaintiffs can sue the vessel itself even when the owner has no liability. 2 Thomas J. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law § 21-3 (4th ed.2004); see, e.g., United States v. Republic Marine, Inc., 829 F.2d 1399, 1400-01 (7th Cir.1987). (4) The Limitation of Shipowners’ Liability Act, 46 U.S.CApp. § 181, generally limits a shipowner’s liability to the value of his investment in the vessel and freight, other than in personal-injury or wrongful-death actions.
