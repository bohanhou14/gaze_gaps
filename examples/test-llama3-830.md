For a legal case, it is essential to consider the requirements for filing a claim and the burden of proof. In the case of 518 U.S. 343, the Supreme Court emphasized that a plaintiff must show actual injury to establish a violation of the right of access to the courts. The court held that the District Court did not find enough instances of actual injury to warrant systemwide relief.

In a similar vein, the case of 855 F.2d 1021 highlights the requirement for a plaintiff to demonstrate actual injury in an access to courts claim. The court noted that a showing of an instance in which an inmate was actually denied access to the courts is required.

In the context of the case presented, it appears that the plaintiff has not satisfied the burden of proof to establish a violation of the right of access to the courts. The complaint alleges that the defendants refused to provide the plaintiff with a copy of the transcript of his 1990 state court criminal trial, but the plaintiff has not provided any evidence of actual injury resulting from this alleged denial of access.

Furthermore, the complaint does not demonstrate that the defendants' actions were taken under color of state law, as required by West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988). Therefore, the complaint does not establish a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.

In conclusion, the plaintiff has not satisfied the requirements for filing a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, and the complaint should be dismissed. The burden of proof rests with the plaintiff to demonstrate actual injury and establish a violation of the right of access to the courts, as demonstrated in the cases of 518 U.S. 343 and 855 F.2d 1021.
