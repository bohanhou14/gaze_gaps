The substantial evidence standard requires this court to affirm the board's decision if it is supported by "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion" (Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971), quoting Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). Given Ahles' prior suspension for similar behavior and his deliberate misstatements, there is substantial evidence under this standard.

Ahles argues that the penalty of dismissal is unduly harsh and an abuse of discretion. However, as demonstrated in the reference case Schaefer (603 F.2d 182, 603 F.2d 182), misstatements made without good faith do not warrant leniency. As in Schaefer, where the plaintiff's intentional misleading behavior justified dismissal, Ahles’ willfulness sets this case apart from instances of mere lack of intent. Therefore, Ahles' dismissal is consistent with established precedent, validating the board's decision.

In conclusion, the board's decision to sustain Ahles' removal is supported by substantial evidence, and the penalty is not arbitrary or abusive but proportionate to the nature of the misconduct, particularly given his previous offense. The decision thus affirms the INS’s action as promoting the efficiency of the service, reflecting both the severity and recurrence of Ahles' infractions.

gold_text: Petitioner argues that there is no substantial evidence to support the finding of intent to defraud the government with respect to Iberia Flight 943 because there was no written policy in effect defining the exact time to close a plane inspection. The case petitioner cites for support, Wise v. United States, 603 F.2d 182, 221 Ct.Cl. 105 (1979), does not go so far as to require a written policy. Wise holds that intent had not been shown when the individual had no reason to know of the agency policy. We hold that petitioner’s prior suspension for the same misconduct now charged was adequate notice of the behavior expected of him. We are satisfied that there was sub stantial evidence of record to support the board finding of intent.
