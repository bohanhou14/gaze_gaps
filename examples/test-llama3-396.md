In reviewing the reference case, I noticed that the courts' decisions were influenced by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and other relevant laws. Specifically, the court in the 796 F.2d 1165 case discussed the applicability of Rule 11, Rule 26(g) and Rule 37, as well as section 1927.

In the context of the case at hand, it is essential to consider whether the dismissal of the complaint is a dismissal of the action. The court in the 803 F.2d 1085 case held that a dismissal of the complaint without dismissal of the action does not end the litigation. The court in this case similarly concluded that the dismissal of the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction did not dismiss the action.

Furthermore, the court in this case discussed the concept of "substantial justification" in the context of Rule 37. The court held that the burden of establishing substantial justification is on the party being sanctioned. In this case, the court concluded that Steel was not substantially justified in failing to appear for the deposition, as he was aware of the order compelling the deposition and that the complaint had been dismissed with leave to amend.

In conclusion, the court's decisions in these cases demonstrate the importance of considering the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and other relevant laws when reviewing legal cases. The concept of "substantial justification" is a crucial factor in determining whether a party is justified in failing to appear for a deposition.

gold_text: The magistrate judge’s sanction order for the motion for reconsideration may have been proper pursuant to Rule 11, but the magistrate judge only identified Rule 37 as the basis for the sanctions. The imposition of Rule 11 sanctions requires both notice and that the award be “properly itemized in terms of the perceived misconduct and the sanctioning authority.” In re Yagman, 796 F.2d 1165, 1183-84 (9th Cir.), as amended, 803 F.2d 1085 (9th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 963, 108 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed.2d 390 (1987). Because neither was provided, the award for the sanctions may not be sustained pursuant to Rule 11. Because we find no support in the record for the imposition of sanctions for the motion for reconsideration, we reverse this portion of the award.
