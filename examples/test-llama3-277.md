The question of anticipation in this case is whether the claimed invention was known or used by others before it was invented by the patentee. According to 35 U.S.C. § 102(a), a patent is invalid if the claimed invention was "known or used by others in this country... before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent." Similarly, 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) states that a patent is invalid if the claimed invention was "in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States."

In the present case, the district court granted summary judgment that claims 1, 6, and 13 of the '315 patent are invalid based on anticipation. However, upon reviewing the case, it appears that the court's decision was based on an incorrect understanding of the law. As mentioned in Scripps Clinic & Research Found, v. Genentech, Inc., 927 F.2d 1565, 1576, 18 USPQ2d 1001, 1010 (Fed.Cir.1991), anticipation requires that the same invention, including each element and limitation of the claims, was known or used by others before it was invented by the patentee.

In this case, the claimed invention is a hollow push rod with a middle portion having a larger outer diameter than the end portions, and substantially constant wall thickness throughout the length of the tube and the tips thereon. This invention is not anticipated by the prior art, as the prior art does not disclose a push rod with this specific shape and structure.

Furthermore, the court's decision was also based on an incorrect understanding of the law, as mentioned in Lindemann Maschinenfabrik GMBH v. American Hoist & Derrick Co., 730 F.2d 1452, 1458, 221 USPQ 481, 485 (Fed.Cir.1984), which states that "anticipation is a question of fact, and the district court's finding thereon is reviewed for clear error."

In conclusion, the district court's decision granting summary judgment that claims 1, 6, and 13 of the '315 patent are invalid based on anticipation is reversed. The invention is not anticipated by the prior art, and the court's decision was based on an incorrect understanding of the law.

citations: ['66 F.3d 299', '911 F.2d 705']

gold_text: Invalidity based on “anticipation” requires that the invention is not in fact new. See, e.g., Hoover Group, Inc. v. Custom Metalcraft, Inc., 66 F.3d 299, 302, 36 USPQ2d 1101, 1103 (Fed.Cir.1995) (“lack of novelty (often called ‘anticipation’) requires that the same invention, including each element and limitation of the claims, was known or used by others before it was invented by the patentee”). A single reference must describe the claimed invention with sufficient precision and detail to establish that the subject matter existed in the prior art. See, e.g., In re Spado, 911 F.2d 705, 708, 15 USPQ2d 1655, 1657 (Fed.Cir.1990) (“the reference must describe the applicant’s claimed invention sufficiently to have placed a person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention in possession of it”).
