(ii) Statutory Damages

Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1), plaintiffs may elect to recover either actual or statutory damages prior to final judgment. As established in Reference case 734 F.2d 1329, statutory damages are available regardless of the adequacy of evidence supporting actual damages or profits. Statutory damages range from $250 to $10,000 per infringement, and up to $50,000 for willful infringements as stated in 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2). The court has considerable discretion in setting the amount as affirmed in 734 F.2d 1329 and 725 F.2d 1.

In this case, Plaintiffs seek statutory damages of $1,500 per infringement, totaling $7,500 for the five infringements (Reference case 734 F.2d 1329). This amount falls within the statutory range and is supported by evidence from plaintiffs’ affidavits demonstrating the unauthorized public performance on February 10, 1990. Given the undisputed facts and the discretion afforded under the statute, the requested statutory damages are reasonable and warranted.

Thus, the Court awards Plaintiffs statutory damages in the amount of $7,500 for the five infringements.

CONCLUSION

For the reasons stated, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment. Plaintiffs are awarded $7,500 in statutory damages, reasonable attorney’s fees, and costs of the action. Additionally, a permanent injunction is issued against Defendants to prevent further infringement of Plaintiffs’ copyrights.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
