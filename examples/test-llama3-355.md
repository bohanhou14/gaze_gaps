In determining whether the payment of a student loan would impose an undue hardship on the debtor, courts have utilized a three-part progressive test. This test includes a mechanical test, a good faith test, and a policy test. In the case of In re Lisanti, 77 B.R. 27 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1987), the court stated that the clear language chosen by the drafters of the Code indicates that the type of hardship involved must be uniquely significant and not merely a general difficulty.

The mechanical test examines a variety of factors in the debtor's vocational profile, including the debtor's current employment and income, future employment and income prospects, educational level, work skills, health, and family support responsibilities. In the case of In re Marion, 61 B.R. 815 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1986), the court held that the debtor's rate of pay, skills, ability to obtain and retain employment, level of education, health, and expenses are all relevant factors to consider.

In the case before us, the debtor's bankruptcy schedules list $714 as her monthly expenses. The debtor's total monthly disposable income is $971, consisting of approximately $653 in take-home pay and $318 in social security benefits. As a result, the debtor has an unbudgeted or "surplus" income of $257 per month. However, the defendant has offered to reduce the payment schedule to $30 per month until paid in full, and the debtor has not made any attempts to renegotiate her loan repayment schedule.

In the case of In re Motor, 64 B.R. 317 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1986), the court held that the good faith test requires the debtor to demonstrate that they have made a good faith effort to renegotiate their loan repayment schedule or to make payments on the loan. In this case, the debtor has not made any attempts to renegotiate her loan repayment schedule, and therefore, fails to meet this test.

In conclusion, the payment of the student loan would not impose an undue hardship on the debtor. The debtor's financial resources during the foreseeable future will be sufficient to repay the loan and to support herself and her son above a poverty level standard of living. The court finds that the debtor has not made a showing that her financial resources during the foreseeable future will not be sufficient to repay her educational loan and to support herself and her son above
