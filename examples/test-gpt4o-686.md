**Generation:**

In this case, the request for security under Rule 65(c) echoes the precedent set in both *Roth v. Bank of the Commonwealth*, 583 F.2d 527 (6th Cir. 1978), and *Urbain v. Knapp Brothers Manufacturing Co.*, 217 F.2d 810 (6th Cir. 1954). 

In *Roth*, the court underscored the discretionary power of district courts concerning the issuance of injunctions and the requirement of security. Specifically, Rule 65(c) mandates security to cover costs and damages incurred by the enjoined party if it is later determined that the injunction was wrongfully issued. Similarly, *Urbain* affirmed that while Rule 65(c) stipulates security, the failure to require it is not necessarily reversible error but falls within the trial court’s discretion.

Considering these precedents, the Court acknowledges the mandatory nature of Rule 65(c) but also recognizes its inherent discretionary power to determine the proper amount of security. Consequently, the Court will require Plaintiff to post a bond, but the specific amount shall be determined based on the Court's assessment of the circumstances and potential costs incurred by Defendant.

Therefore, the Court finds in favor of Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, conditioned upon the posting of adequate security to be calculated in due course, in line with the principles elucidated in *Roth* and *Urbain*.
