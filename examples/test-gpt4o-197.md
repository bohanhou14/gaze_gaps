The treatment of the USPS as a federal agency for the purposes of this court's jurisdiction reflects an understanding aligned with case precedents. In "Butz Eng’g Corp. v. United States," 499 F.2d 619, the court applied the definition under 28 U.S.C. § 451 to determine that the USPS fell under the pre-ADRA Tucker Act. Further, in "Ex parte Skinner & Eddy Corp.," 265 U.S. 86, the Court recognized that entities acting under the authority of the United States, such as the USPS, are treated as federal instrumentalities.

The argument that the USPS's exemption under 39 U.S.C. § 410(a) precludes its classification as a federal agency within the context of the Tucker Act is contrary to precedent. In "Cherry Cotton Mills, Inc. v. United States," 327 U.S. 536, the Supreme Court established that the classification of an entity as a corporation does not alter its character or its governmental purpose.

Consequently, despite the exemptions under certain procurement laws mentioned in "United States v. Electronic Data Sys. Fed. Corp.," the plain meaning and jurisdictional mandate of the Tucker Act as interpreted in "Butz Eng’g Corp." and "Cherry Cotton Mills" do not narrow this court’s jurisdiction over the USPS. Therefore, the court concludes that it retains the authority to adjudicate HP’s bid protest concerning USPS procurement decisions. The USPS is indeed a federal agency within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b).
