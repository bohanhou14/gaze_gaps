ORDER ON OBJECTIONS AND FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
KIMBA M. WOOD, District Judge.

Plaintiff Anthony Marvello ("Marvello") has sought an extension of time to file objections to Magistrate Judge Peck's Report and Recommendation ("Report"), which this Court adopted on April 10, 1996. Marvello asserts that his disability necessitates a longer period to file objections.

The Court's decision to deny the motion to dismiss, following the Report's recommendations, largely serves Marvello's interests. As per the relevant case law (see Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140; Wesolek v. Canadair Ltd., 838 F.2d 55), objections to a magistrate judge's report must be filed within ten days, unless explicit notice, as established in 9 F.3d 1049 and 968 F.2d 298, allows otherwise for pro se litigants. 

Marvello raised concerns about discovery burdens, which should first be addressed by Magistrate Judge Peck per 714 F.2d 234. Therefore, I direct Marvello to submit any discovery-related challenges directly to Magistrate Judge Peck.

Moreover, Marvello also sought appointment of counsel, which needs to be addressed first by Magistrate Judge Peck. In conclusion, I deny Marvello’s request for an extension and uphold my previous decision to adopt Magistrate Judge Peck’s Report in full.

SO ORDERED.
