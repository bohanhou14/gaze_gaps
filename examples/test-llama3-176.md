In the case of United States v. Fuller, the District Court sentenced the defendant to 151 months' imprisonment, with a four-level upward departure, based on the defendant's bartering of drugs in exchange for firearms. The defendant appealed, arguing that the District Court's sentence was unreasonable and that the court erred in applying the upward departure

gold_text: Our sister circuits that have confronted this issue have unanimously held, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that where a reviewing court determines, based upon the statements of the district court in the record, that an upward departure is otherwise reasonable, the district court’s failure to provide a written explanation in the order of judgment is not a separate cause for remand. See United States v. Cooper, 394 F.3d 172 (3d Cir.2005) (“We agree with the other Courts of Appeal[s] that have concluded that failing to provide a written explanation for a departure is not cause for remand if the departure is otherwise permissible and the district court’s reasoning is persuasive.”); United States v. Daychild, 357 F.3d 1082, 1107-08 (9th Cir.2004) (holding, based on the language of 18 U.S.C. § 3742(f), that remand is not required in these circumstances); United States v. Orchard, 332 F.3d 1133, 1141 n. 7 (8th Cir.2003) (same).
