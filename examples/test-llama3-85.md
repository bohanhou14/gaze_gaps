In the case of Randall v. State, 540 S.W.2d 156 (Mo.App.1976), the court found that the state's interest in preventing the damages of narcotic drugs outweighed the defendant's interest in practicing his religion. Similarly, in Leary v. United States, 383 F.2d 851 (5th Cir. 1967), the court held that the government's interest in preventing the dangers of psychedelic drugs outweighed the defendant's religious interest in using them. The court in Kuch v. United States, 288 F.Supp. 439 (D.D.C.1968), also found that the government's interest in preventing the dangers of LSD outweighed the defendant's religious interest in using it.

In the case of 410 U.S. 690, the court held that the government's interest in preventing the dangers of drugs outweighed the defendant's religious interest in using them. The court in 427 F.2d 412, also held that the government's interest in preventing the dangers of drugs outweighed the defendant's religious interest in using them.

The court in 469 F.2d 535, found that the government's interest in preventing the dangers of drugs outweighed the defendant's religious interest in using them. The court in 540 S.W.2d 156, also found that the government's interest in preventing the dangers of drugs outweighed the defendant's religious interest in using them.

In conclusion, based on the references provided, it is clear that the courts have consistently held that the government's interest in preventing the dangers of drugs outweighs the defendant's religious interest in using them. Therefore, it is unlikely that the court would grant a writ of habeas corpus based on the defendant's religious beliefs.
