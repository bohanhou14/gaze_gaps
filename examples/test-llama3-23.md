In the case of Waterman v. United States, the defendant, Albert Tucker, was convicted of bank robbery and appealed the conviction, arguing that his confession was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights, and that the confession and its fruits were erroneously admitted into evidence against him.

The court held that the alleged error, if indeed error, was a constitutionally harmless error, and therefore, the judgment of conviction was affirmed. The court relied on the cases of Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), and Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969), which hold that even if there is a supportable claim of constitutional error, the admission of the confession was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court also noted that the evidence against Tucker was overwhelming, including the testimony of his accomplices, the bank employee who identified him as one of the robbers, and the unimpeachable photograph taken by the hidden movie camera showing Tucker committing the crime. The court concluded that the admission of the allegedly unconstitutionally obtained confession and money, if error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

In contrast, the Supreme Court has held in cases such as Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U.S. 560, 78 S.Ct. 844, 2 L.Ed.2d 975 (1958), that even though there may have been sufficient evidence, apart from the coerced confession, to support a judgment of conviction, the admission in evidence, over objection, of the coerced confession vitiates the judgment of conviction. However, in this case, the court found that the admission of the confession was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

In conclusion, the court held that the alleged error in the admission of the confession was constitutionally harmless and therefore the judgment of conviction was affirmed. The court relied on the cases of Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), and Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969), and noted that the

gold_text: See also, e. g., Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 376, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964); Haynes v. Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 517-520, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 205-208, 80 S.Ct. 274, 4 L.Ed.2d 242 (1960) Neither the physical or mental coercion nor the trickery that was practiced in the cited cases occurred here; this record does not support such a claim. Consequently, the general statement in Payne v. Arkansas which we have quoted, supra, applicable there, is obviously inapplicable here. Even if Tucker’s allegations of improper officer conduct could be substantiated and his confession were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights, a reversal of the conviction and a remand for a new trial would be an act of complete futility. Without the evidence of the confession and of the recovered loot appellant’s guilt was overwhelmingly proved by other clearly constitutionally admissible evidence.
