Given that the Plaintiff has not suffered any economic loss from the discrimination, the court must consider alternative remedies. In light of the principles outlined in the reference cases, nominal damages are appropriate. As established in Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, awards of nominal damages are suitable where the deprivation of rights did not cause actual, provable injury. The purpose of this award is to vindicate the importance of the rights violated without substantial proof of injury. Moreover, as noted in the reference case 477 U.S. 299, substantial damages should only be awarded to compensate for actual injury or to deter malicious deprivation of rights, neither of which are applicable here.

Additionally, awarding attorney's fees aligns with the ADEA's goals of making the plaintiff whole, as discussed in Verbraeken v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 881 F.2d 1041, 1052 (11th Cir.1989). Given the circumstances and the lack of demonstrated damages, the court concludes that nominal damages and attorney's fees constitute adequate relief. This approach avoids putting the Plaintiff in a worse economic position and prevents unjust harm to the current Building Inspector, Mrs. Hamrick. Thus, the Plaintiff's request for instatement is denied in favor of these alternatives, ensuring that the remedy is both fair and consistent with legal precedents.

gold_text: The Supreme Court has applied this same rule in the context of constitutional violations. In Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978), the Court held that damages awards in cases arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the fourteenth amendment should be governed by the principle of compensation. 435 U.S. at 254-58, 98 S.Ct. at 1047-49. In Memphis Community School Dish v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 106 S.Ct. 2537, 91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986), a case involving the first and fourteenth amendments, the Court reaffirmed that damages are intended as compensation, and specifically held that “when § 1983 plaintiffs seek damages for violations of constitutional rights, the level of damages is ordinarily determined according to principles derived from the common law of torts.” 477 U.S. at 305-06, 106 S.Ct. at 2542.
