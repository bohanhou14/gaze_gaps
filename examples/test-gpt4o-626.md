B. Eighth Amendment Claim

Caliendo's contention that his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment is equally unpersuasive. The California Court of Appeal upheld his 25-years-to-life sentence under the state's three strikes law. In assessing this claim, we follow precedents set by reference cases like Andrade, 286 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2003), and Rummel v. Estelle, 202 F.3d 1190 (9th Cir. 1990). In Andrade, the court upheld a life sentence for a nonviolent theft due to the defendant's extensive criminal history, affirming that the state's interest in deterring recidivism justifies severe penalties under the three strikes law.

Similarly, in Rummel, the court allowed a life sentence for obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses, again underscoring the validity of stringent repeat-offender statutes. Given Caliendo's repeat offenses, and the rationale in these pivotal cases, it cannot be said that his sentence is "grossly disproportionate” to his crime. The state has a significant interest in incapacitating habitual offenders to protect public safety.

Thus, the California Court of Appeal's decision to deny relief on Eighth Amendment grounds is consistent with clearly established federal law and precedents. Therefore, we affirm the district court's denial of habeas relief on this claim.

gold_text: While the state appellate court determined that no prejudice resulted from the incident, we may not simply defer to this finding. AEDPA’s presumption of correctness does not apply to state court findings arrived at through the use of erroneous legal standards. See Fernandez v. Roe, 286 F.3d 1073, 1077 (9th Cir.2002); Wade v. Terhune, 202 F.3d 1190, 1197 (9th Cir.2000). The state appellate court employed an incorrect standard when it placed the burden of proof on the defendant instead of the government. We therefore review de novo the correct question of whether the government met its heavy burden of proof under Mattox and Remmer. See Thompson, 74 F.3d at 1573.
