In the context of legal cases, the concept of "nominal party" and "remand" are crucial. A nominal party is a person or entity that is named as a party in a legal action but does not have a real interest in the outcome of the case. Remand, on the other hand, refers to the process of sending a case back to a lower court or tribunal for further proceedings.

In the case of 676 F.2d 270, the court held that a legally defective removal petition subjects the case to remand. The court stated that a "legally defective" removal petition is one that fails to comply with the requirements of the removal statute, such as failing to allege that a nominal party is a party to the action. In this case, the petition for removal was defective because it failed to allege that the AAA was a nominal party.

In the case of 644 F.2d 1310, the court held that a removal petition must be filed by all defendants who are entitled to join in the removal. The court stated that the removal statute requires that all defendants who are entitled to join in the removal must agree to the removal, and that a petition for removal filed by only one defendant is defective.

In the context of the case at hand, the petition for removal is defective because it was filed by only one of the named respondents in the state court action, Point Vail. The court has held that a removal petition must be filed by all defendants who are entitled to join in the removal, and that a petition for removal filed by only one defendant is defective. Therefore, the case must be remanded to the state court.

Overall, the cases of 676 F.2d 270 and 644 F.2d 1310 provide guidance on the requirements for a removal petition and the consequences of a defective removal petition. In this case, the defective removal petition subjects the case to remand, and the court must send the case back to the state court for further proceedings. <answer>
