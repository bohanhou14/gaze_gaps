The case of MBNA America Bank, N.A. v. Hill presents a conflict between the Bankruptcy Code and the Federal Arbitration Act. MBNA seeks to stay or dismiss Hill's adversary proceeding, which alleges violations of 11 U.S.C. § 362(h) and unjust enrichment, in favor of arbitration under the parties' account agreement. The bankruptcy court denied MBNA's motion, concluding that the court was the most appropriate forum to adjudicate the matter. The district court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to dismiss or stay the proceeding in favor of arbitration.

The Federal Arbitration Act establishes a federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, and courts have a duty to stay their proceedings if they are satisfied that the issue before them is arbitrable. However, the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provision, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a), is a core bankruptcy proceeding that implicates "more pressing bankruptcy concerns." The court must consider whether arbitration would "necessarily jeopardize" the objectives of the Bankruptcy Code, which include the goal of centralized resolution of purely bankruptcy issues and the need to protect creditors and reorganizing debtors from piecemeal litigation.

In this case, Hill's claim under 11 U.S.C. § 362(h) is properly characterized as a core bankruptcy proceeding. The court must balance the competing interests of the Bankruptcy Code and the Federal Arbitration Act, considering whether arbitration would seriously jeopardize the objectives of the Bankruptcy Code. The court concludes that arbitration of Hill's claim would not seriously jeopardize the objectives of the Bankruptcy Code because Hill's estate has been fully administered, the claims lack a direct connection to her own bankruptcy case, and a stay is not so closely related to an injunction that the bankruptcy court is uniquely able to interpret and enforce its provisions.

gold_text: First, and most importantly, arbitration of Hill’s § 362(h) claim would not jeopardize the important purposes that the automatic stay serves: providing debtors with a fresh start, protecting the assets of the estate, and allowing the bankruptcy court to centralize disputes concerning the estate. See SEC v. Brennan, 230 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir.2000). District courts have often reversed bankruptcy decisions refusing to compel arbitration of core bankruptcy matters and granted motions to arbitrate core claims on the grounds that arbitration would not interfere with or affect the distribution of the estate. See, e.g., Cibro Petroleum Prods., Inc. v. City of Albany (In re Winimo Realty Corp.), 270 B.R. 108 (S.D.N.Y.2001); Pardo v. Akai Elec. Co. Ltd. (In re Singer Co. N.V.), 2001 WL 984678 (S.D.N.Y.
