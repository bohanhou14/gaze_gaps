**Generation:**

Lott's procedural arguments do not hold water. First, the district court was within its rights to conclude that Lott's complaint did not clearly articulate a per quod defamation claim. This aligns with established precedent that requires clear and distinct claims within the initial pleading for proper adjudication. See Spelson, 581 F.Supp. at 1206; Barton v. Barnett, 226 F.Supp. 375 (N.D.Mass.1964) (reference case 776 F.2d 143).

Additionally, Lott's attempt to amend his complaint to include a per quod claim was rightly denied as untimely and futile. In similar circumstances, courts have held that allowing untimely amendments undermines procedural integrity and judicial efficiency, especially when the proposed amendments would not change the outcome. See Muzikowski v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 322 F.3d 918, where the court noted the futility and untimeliness of the plaintiff's amendments (reference case 322 F.3d 918).

The summary judgment dismissal of Lott’s claims under Illinois law stands. As further supported by recent rulings, the procedural stage matters; Lott's contentions fail to overcome the procedural bar and futility of the amendments proposed. See Tuite, 310 Ill.Dec. 303, 866 N.E.2d at 124-126; Knafel v. Chicago Sun-Times, Inc., 413 F.3d 637, 641 (7th Cir.2005). Lott's appeal for an untimely amendment was accordingly denied. See Madison v. Frazier, 539 F.3d 646, 654 (7th Cir.2008) (reference cases 713 F.2d 262, 515 F.3d 778).

gold_text: Both these arguments fail for the same reason — Lott neglected to allege any special damages in both his original complaint and his proposed amended complaint. In Illinois courts and federal courts sitting in diversity, special damages must be specifically stated in a pro quod claim. Fed.R.CivJP. 9(g); Muzikowski v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 322 F.3d 918, 927 (7th Cir.2003); Action Repair, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., 776 F.2d 143, 149-50 (7th Cir.1985); Schaffer v. Zekman, 196 Ill.App.3d 727, 143 Ill.Dec. 916, 554 N.E.2d 988, 992 (1990). In his original complaint, which made no explicit pro quod claim, Lott alleged only “substantial reputational and monetary damages,” without a specific accounting of those damages or an explanation of how the purported defamation caused them. While the proposed amended complaint explicitly tacked on a claim for pro quod defamation, its allegations of damages are equally vague. Lott added allegations that he encountered people in job interviews and at academic seminars who understood the passage to be a swipe at his professional reputation but does not describe what pecuniary losses he suffered as a result. Lott doesn’t even say what came of the job interviews where the book was mentioned. Such general allegations, which make no effort to explain how any reputational damage translated into actual harm, are not enough. Muzikowski, 322 F.3d at 927; Action Repair, Inc., 776 F.2d at 149-50, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Jacobson, 713 F.2d 262, 269-70 (7th Cir.1983). Thus, we see no error in the district court’s dismissal of the defamation claim or its refusal to accept the futile amended complaint. Johnson v. Dossey, 515 F.3d 778, 780 (7th Cir.2008).
