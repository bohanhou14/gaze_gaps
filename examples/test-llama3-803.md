UTHSCH argues that King's FCA retaliation claim should be dismissed because, as an arm of the State of Texas, it is not a proper defendant under the language of § 3730(h). UTHSCH relies on Elizondo v. Univ. of Tex. at San Antonio, 2005 WL 823353, citing 171 F.3d 279. However, the 2009 amendment to the FCA removed the term "employer" from the antiretaliation provision, making Elizondo's holding less relevant. See Bell v. Dean, 2010 WL 1856086.

UTHSCH also argues that King's retaliation claim is barred by sovereign immunity. However, the FCA's antiretaliation provision does not contain an exception for state entities. See 535 F.3d 318. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the test for determining whether a State has waived its immunity from federal-court jurisdiction is a stringent one. College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 675, 119 S.Ct. 2219, 144 L.Ed.2d 605.

In conclusion, UTHSCH's motion to dismiss King's FCA retaliation claim is denied. King's claim is not barred by sovereign immunity, and the 2009 amendment to the FCA makes Elizondo's holding less relevant. The court will consider King's claim based on the merits. <answer>

citations: ['171 F.3d 279', '535 F.3d 318']

gold_text: The amendment to § 3730(h) does not alter the result that UTHSCH is entitled to dismissal of King’s retaliation claim. King’s claim for monetary relief against UTHSCH is barred by sovereign immunity. In United States ex rel. Foulds v. Tex. Tech Univ., 171 F.3d 279 (5th Cir.1999), the Fifth Circuit held that sovereign immunity prevented a plaintiff from seeking damages under § 3730 against a public university hospital in Texas. Id. at 294-OS; see also Nelson v. Univ. of Tex. at Dali, 535 F.3d 318, 320 (5th Cir.2008) (holding that sovereign immunity barred money claims against a state university hospital in Texas). The 2009 amendment to § 3730(h) does not alter Foulds’ holding.. The FCA’s antiretaliation provision does not include a clear statement stripping state sovereign immunity. King provides no other reason for concluding that Congress has abrogated or that UTHSCH has waived its sovereign immunity.
