The court's analysis of Transport's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is guided by the principle that "when other claims are joined with an action for declaratory relief... the district court should not, as a general rule, remand or decline to entertain the claim for declaratory relief." (242 F.3d 1102). The court must determine whether the district court's jurisdiction is discretionary or mandatory. (147 F.3d 1163).

In this case, the court finds that Transport's contacts with the state of Idaho are sufficient to establish specific jurisdiction. (242 F.3d 1102). The insurance policies covering Wells Cargo's Idaho activities constitute Transport's purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in Idaho. (Farmers Insurance Exchange v. Portage La Prairie Mutual Insurance Co., 907 F.2d 911, 913).

The court also finds that the case may proceed in the District of Idaho under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c). (242 F.3d 1102). Transport's argument that the case should be transferred to Nevada under principles of forum non conveniens is also rejected. (Decker Coal Co. v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 805 F.2d 834, 843).

In conclusion, the court denies Transport's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and finds that the case may proceed in the District of Idaho. (242 F.3d 1102). The court also denies Transport's motion to transfer the case to Nevada under principles of forum non conveniens. (Decker Coal Co., 805 F.2d at 843).

gold_text: Typically, the Ninth Circuit has “applied the principle that ‘when other claims are joined with an action for declaratory relief (e.g., bad faith, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, rescission, or claims for other monetary relief), the district court should not, as a general rule, remand or decline to entertain the claim for declaratory relief.’ ” United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Gorp., 242 F.3d 1102, 1112 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting Dizol, 133 F.3d at 1225). To determine whether jurisdiction over actions with both declaratory and monetary claims remains discretionary, the Ninth Circuit instructs courts to “determine whether there are claims in the case that exist independent of any request for purely declaratory relief, that is, claims that would continue to exist if the request for a declaration simply dropped from the case.” Id. (quoting Snodgrass v. Provident Life and Acc. Ins. Co., 147 F.3d 1163, 1167-68 (9th Cir.1998) (per curiam)). Thus, the question is whether the court “has subject matter jurisdiction over the monetary claim alone, and if so, whether that claim must be joined with one for declaratory relief.” Id.
