Given these circumstances, it was crucial for Neighbors to assess R2 and R3's interactions and cognitive capacities. Similar to the findings in case 743 F.3d 196, where the requirement of evidence was necessary to demonstrate non-consent, here, the absence of thorough consent assessment is telling. As established in reference case 868 F.3d 731, consent must be explicitly confirmed, especially when dealing with cognitively impaired individuals, to ensure their interactions are genuinely consensual. The failure to undertake appropriate measures to verify consent constituted a significant oversight.

Thus, just as in the aforementioned cases, Neighbors' nonchalance towards verifying consent and overriding the immediate safety concerns was a critical regulatory failure. Consequently, substantial evidence supports the Agency's determination, affirming the citation and penalty imposed due to Neighbors' inadequacies in handling resident interactions.

gold_text: The ALJ repeatedly highlighted the serious cognitive deficits of R2 and R3 (which were documented in the record) and observed that these deficits created an even greater need to investigate whether any abuse was taking place. Yet the record reflects that no such investigation occurred. Neighbors would have us hold that it is appropriate to presume consent as long as there is no resistance. To do so would be to hold persons with dementia and Alzheimer's to a higher standard than we hold the average person. See, e.g. , United States v. Johnson , 743 F.3d 196, 199 n.1 (7th Cir. 2014) (noting that, under Illinois law, resistance is not necessary to prove sexual assault); see also United States v. Cobenais , 868 F.3d 731, 740 (8th Cir. 2017) (noting that, under 18 U.S.C. ยง 2241(a), the government need not show that a sexual abuse victim resisted).
