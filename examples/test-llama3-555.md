In the case of 360 U.S. 310, the Supreme Court discussed the concept of the right of confrontation and the admissibility of testimony given at a former trial. The court held that in cases where a witness is unavailable and has given testimony at a previous judicial proceeding against the same defendant, which was subject to cross-examination, the testimony may be read to the jury without violating the right of confrontation. This exception is based on the necessity of the situation and the fact that the right of cross-examination initially afforded provides substantial compliance with the purposes behind the confrontation requirement.

In the case at hand, the appellants argue that the trial court erred in permitting the use of the witnesses' testimony at the prior trial. However, the trial court followed the proper procedure in granting immunity to the witnesses and attempting to have them testify. When the witnesses refused to testify, the court allowed the transcript of their testimony to be read to the jury. This is in line with the Supreme Court's holding in 360 U.S. 310.

The appellants also argue that the trial court failed to explain to the jury why the testimony was read, rather than given by the witnesses themselves. However, the trial judge stated that the jury would likely be prejudiced if an explanation was given due to the publicity surrounding the case. This is within the discretion of the trial judge and is not reversible error.

In conclusion, the trial court did not err in permitting the use of the witnesses' testimony at the prior trial. The court followed the proper procedure in granting immunity and attempting to have the witnesses testify, and the judge's decision not to explain the reason for reading the testimony was within his discretion.

Also, it is the general rule that error in the admission of evidence under most circumstances may be cured by withdrawing the evidence from the jury’s consideration and instructing the jury to disregard it. Holt v. United States, 94 F.2d 90 (10th Cir.). However, as an exception to the general rule, where the character of the testimony is such that it will create so strong an impression on the minds of the jurors that they will be unable to disregard it in their consideration of the case, although admonished to do so, a mistrial should be ordered. Holt v. United States, supra; Marshall v. United States, 360 U.S. 310, 79 S.Ct. 1171, 3 L.Ed.2d 1250 ; United States v. Jacangelo, 281 F.2d 574 (3d Cir.).”
