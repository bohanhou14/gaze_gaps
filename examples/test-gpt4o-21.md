E. Additional Considerations
In addressing the plausibility of the Thomases' claims, we are guided by precedent from the Supreme Court. In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, the court emphasized that while a complaint must contain enough factual content "to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence" of a claim, mere parallel conduct or a bare assertion of conspiracy is insufficient. This standard, reiterated in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, requires that the factual matter asserted must plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief, and not merely be consistent with a lawful scenario.

Here, the Thomases failed to meet this pleading standard. Their allegations lacked specific factual detail and relied heavily on conclusory statements. For instance, the Thomases did not provide evidence that U.S. Bank and the Rubin law firm’s actions constituted a knowing and intentional publication of false information or that U.S. Bank qualified as a "debt collector" or "loan servicer" under the FDCPA and RESPA, respectively. As a result, their claims do not satisfy the plausibility requirement established in Twombly and Iqbal, thus affirming the district court's dismissal (556 U.S. 662; 550 U.S. 544). 

AFFIRMED.

. We recognize that pro se pleadings are to be liberally construed. See Tannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998).
. The Thomases also asserted claims for negligence, declaratory relief, and violations of the Truth in Lending Act, but they do not challenge the dismissal of those claims.

We accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true, construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Id. A formulaic recitation of the elements of a claim is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The complaint survives a motion to dismiss only where the factual allegations "plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 681, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1951, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).
