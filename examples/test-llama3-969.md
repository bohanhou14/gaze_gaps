The cases presented demonstrate the complexities of partnership laws and the nuances of tax regulations. In the case of Lucretia Ellis v. James N. Ellis, reference 280 F. 457, the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia ruled that a husband and wife's partnership was valid under the laws of Mississippi, despite the absence of a written agreement.

Similarly, in the case of John T. Newell v. Com'r, reference 17 B.T.A. 93, the court held that a husband and wife's profit-sharing agreement was enforceable, even though it was not in writing. The court recognized that the arrangement was a valid partnership, citing the Uniform Partnership Law and other authorities.

In contrast, the case of Champlin v. Commissioner, reference 71 F.2d 23, involved a situation where the taxpayer's profits were taxed as those of her husband, despite her own claims to ownership. The court held that the profits were taxable to her husband, citing the formal bookkeeping of the grocery business and the lack of evidence of a profit-sharing agreement.

The case of T. F. Kelley v. Com'r, reference 9 B.T.A. 834, is also relevant, as it involved a husband and wife's partnership in a business, with the wife claiming a share of the profits. The court held that the wife's share of the profits was taxable to her, despite the lack of a written agreement.

In conclusion, the cases demonstrate that the laws surrounding partnerships and tax regulations are complex and nuanced, and that the existence and enforceability of a partnership agreement can depend on a variety of factors, including the jurisdiction, the type of business, and the evidence presented. Taxpayers and courts must carefully consider these factors in order to ensure that the tax laws are applied fairly and consistently.

gold_text: We may add that the existence of such a contract appears far from unlikely. By hypothesis, since the property is held jointly, the suspicion attaching to these agreements when urged as a basis for recovery against a decedent’s estate is lacking here. See In re Barnet’s Estate, 320 Pa. 408, 182 A. 699, but cf. Ellis v. Ellis, 51 App.D.C. 383, 280 F. 457. It is also to be observed that the much vexed problem of the allocation of taxable income between spouses has been solved (if any generalization is permissible) by allowing income to be split, where, as here, a part is the product of one spouse’s capital or services, M. L. Virden v. Com’r, 6 B.T.A. 1123; J. W. Brackman v. Com’r, 24 B.T.A. 259; H. S. Tuthill v. Com’r, 22 B.T.A. 887; John T. Newell v. Com’r, 17 B.T.A. 93, above cited; T. F. Kelley v. Com’r, 9 B.T.A. 834, above cited; Champlin v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 71 F.2d 23, above cited; Pugh v. United States, D.C., 48 F.2d 600. Compare Cohan v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 39 F. 2d 540; J. I. Robertson v. Com’r, 20 B.T. A. 112, 113; W. E. Buchanan v. Com’r, 20 B.T.A. 210. So the suspicion that husband and wife are conniving in a scheme of tax avoidance yields to the economic reality of the wife’s actual participation in business, even if it is her husband’s. That reality, furthermore, is not rare. Indeed a farflung system of marital property has been based upon it. We quote: “The causes which made the wife the partner of the husband are of an economical nature rather than a moral nature * * * In towns, where family possessions are rarely met with, there is nothing to offer an obstacle to its adoption; the marriage portion of the wife consists in the making of an investment, as would the share of a partner. The benefits resulting from commerce and industry, or acquests which are realized because of them, are shared, because the woman, owing to her fortune or activity, contributes to their production. Community is thus the matrimonial system 'of merchants”. Brissaud, History of French Private Law, sec. 554, pp. 817, 818
