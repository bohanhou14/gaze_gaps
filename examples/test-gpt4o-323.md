In determining the liability coverage under T-W's comprehensive policy with The Travelers Indemnity Company, the principle established in Reference case 142 U.S. 691 and its duplicate 35 L. Ed. 1160 outlines that exclusions in insurance policies must be clearly defined and substantiated by the insurer to deny a claim. In this case, the "care, custody, or control" exclusion cited by Travelers does not apply. T-W merely accessed the barge to obtain mud for the drilling operation. The exclusion requires demonstrable dominion and control over the property, which T-W did not have. Instead, Humble Oil Company exercised such dominion as they kept the mud barge supplied and ready for use. This scenario aligns with the jurisprudence from Thomas W. Hooley & Sons v. Zurich Gen. Acc. & L. Ins. Co., which underlines that properties merely incidental to the insured's operations, but not controlled by the insured, do not fall under exclusion clauses. Therefore, similar to Hooley, the responsibility for the damages does not lie with T-W but with the insurer, and Travelers’ refusal to cover the claim lacks justification, potentially rendering them liable for penalties and attorneys' fees.

gold_text: It is admitted that the interpretation herein placed on the words “occupied or used by” and “care, custody or control” is not free from doubt. In fact, in some respects it may be at variance with their dictionary definitions. But dictionary definitions do not reflect the legal gloss to which these words have been subjected. Nor do they relieve the insurer of the burden of proving non-coverage under the exclusions in the policy. Home Benefit Association v. Sargent, 142 U.S. 691, 12 S.Ct. 332, 35 L.
