The Suspension Clause prohibits the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus except in cases of rebellion or invasion. However, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) established a one-year statute of limitations for filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus by a state prisoner. This limitation period has been challenged as violating the Suspension Clause.

In Lucidore v. Kuhlmann, 209 F.3d 107, the Second Circuit held that the one-year statute of limitations does not render the writ of habeas corpus "inadequate or ineffective" and therefore does not per se constitute an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. The court noted that the limitations period leaves habeas petitioners with some reasonable opportunity to have their claims heard on the merits.

Similarly, in Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, the Supreme Court ruled that the successive petition requirements of § 2254 did not violate the Suspension Clause. The Court noted that Congress has the authority to define the scope of the writ of habeas corpus and that judgments about the proper scope of the writ are left to Congress.

In Rodriguez v. Artuz, 161 F.3d 763, the Second Circuit held that the AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations does not violate the Suspension Clause. The court noted that the limitations period does not render the writ of habeas corpus "inadequate or ineffective" and therefore does not per se constitute an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.

In contrast, in Miller v. Marr, 141 F.3d 976, the Tenth Circuit held that the AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations did violate the Suspension Clause. However, this decision was based on the court's conclusion that the limitations period rendered the writ of habeas corpus "inadequate or ineffective" and was therefore unconstitutional.

In conclusion, the one-year statute of limitations established by AEDPA does not violate the Suspension Clause. The limitations period leaves habeas petitioners with some reasonable opportunity to have their claims heard on the merits and does not render the writ of habeas corpus "inadequate or ineffective." Reference cases: 209 F.3d 107, 177 F.3d 390, 128 F.3d 1283.

gold_text: The one-year limitation does not violate the Suspension Clause because it is not jurisdictional and may be subject to equitable tolling. See Lucidore v. New York State Div. of Parole, 209 F.3d 107, 113 (2d Cir.2000) (concluding that “because AED-PA’s one-year statute of limitations leaves habeas petitioners with some reasonable opportunity to have their claims heard on the merits,” it does not constitute a per se violation of the Suspension Clause), petition for cert, filed, 69 U.S.L.W. 3086 (U.S. July 5, 2000); Turner v. Johnson, 177 F.3d 390, 392-93 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, - U.S. -, 120 S.Ct. 504, 145 L.Ed.2d 389 (1999); Miller v. Marr, 141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998). “The one-year time period begins to run in accordance with individual circumstances that could reasonably affect the availability of the remedy, but requires inmates to diligently pursue claims.” Miller, 141 F.3d at 978 (internal citations omitted) (citing Calderon v. United States District Court, 128 F.3d 1283, 1289 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc)). We therefore hold that the one-year limitation does not per se render the writ of habeas corpus inadequate or ineffective.
