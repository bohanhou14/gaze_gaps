In reviewing the district court's decision, we must consider the legal authority to depart, the sufficiency of the factual findings, and the reasonableness of the upward departure.

The district court departed upward under Guideline § 2A2.1(a)(2), which covers assaults in which the object is murder, other than first-degree murder. The court added four levels for an adjusted base offense level of 26, citing Application Note 3, which provides that an upward departure may be warranted if the offense created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to more than one person. (Citing 909 F.2d 395)

Mathews argues that the upward departure was unlawful because the district court failed to provide adequate guidance on how it arrived at the 34-month departure. The court's silence makes it impossible for us to review the reasonableness of the departure. (Citing 901 F.2d 746) We have held that in departing, a "sentencing court must state its reasons for the extent of the departure." Wells, 878 F.2d at 1233.

In this case, the district court relied on Guideline § 2A2.3, Minor Assault, to analogize to the defendant's conduct. However, the court's analogy was flawed, and the four-level increase was grossly disproportionate. If Mathews had been charged with minor assault on each of the two occupants of the home, the three related offenses would have been subject to the grouping rules, and the additional punishment would not have increased Mathews' sentence. The Sentencing Commission's background commentary makes clear that this is the intended result of the grouping rules, and indicates that additional punishment for substantially less culpable offense groups should usually be handled by sentencing at the higher end of the guideline range, warranting departure only in unusual cases.

We therefore hold that the extent of the departure was unreasonable and remand for resentencing. (Citing United States v. Sabian, 114 F.3d 913, 916 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc)).

gold_text: The determination whether and how far upward to depart remains in the district court’s discretion. If, on remand, the court departs, it shall, in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), state “the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from that described” in the guideline. See Lira-Barraza, 941 F.2d at 751; United States v. Todd, 909 F.2d 395, 398-99 (9th Cir.1990) (sentence vacated because court “failed to explain why it sentenced [the defendant] to a prison term 34 months in excess of the maximum term ... under the Guidelines”); United States v. Gayou, 901 F.2d 746, 749-50 (9th Cir.1990) (same); United States v. Wells, 878 F.2d 1232, 1233 (9th Cir.1989). The requirement that the court state its reasons for imposing a particular sentence is distinct from the required statement of reasons for departing. This case illustrates the justification for the requirement; as we have noted, a four-level adjustment at elevated offense levels can have a dramatic effect on the length of the sentence quite disproportionate to what the sentence would have been for the analogous offense standing alone. In this case, the judge adequately explained why he intended to depart and why he chose as analogous the minor assault guideline. But he failed to explain why he imposed a sentence 54 months longer than the maximum guideline sentence of 97 months.
