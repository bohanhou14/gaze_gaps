MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

The United States Bankruptcy Court for the [insert district] District of [insert state] (the "Court") hereby issues this Memorandum Opinion and Order in the above-captioned matter.

In considering the Trustee's Amended Objection to the Debtor's Exemptions, the Court must determine whether the Debtor's inherited individual retirement account ("IRA") is exempt from the bankruptcy estate. The Court finds that an IRA inherited from someone other than a spouse may not be claimed as exempt from the bankruptcy estate. In re Kirchen, 344 B.R. 908 (Bankr.E.D.Wis.2006).

The Court notes that the Internal Revenue Code treats an inherited IRA differently than one's own IRA. In re Navarre, 332 B.R. 24 (Bankr.M.D.Ala.2004). The beneficiary of an inherited IRA may not roll it over into another account, and may not make any contributions to it. In re Sims, 241 B.R. 467 (Bankr.N.D.Okla.1999). Most importantly, the beneficiary can remove funds at any time, for any reason, and without penalty — and must either start taking lifespan-measured withdrawals within one year or take the entire amount within five years, regardless of the beneficiary's age. In re Greenfield, 289 B.R. 146 (Bankr.S.D.Cal.2003).

In light of the above, the Court sustains the Trustee's Amended Objection to the Debtor's Exemptions. The Debtor's inherited IRA is not exempt from the bankruptcy estate.

SO ORDERED.

The Debtor is not barred from claiming the state exemptions even though the Debtor first elected the federal exemptions, and then, after the Trustee filed an objection to the federal exemptions, elected the state exemptions Bankruptcy Rule 1009(a) states that a "voluntary petition, list, schedule, or statement may be amended by the debtor as a matter of course at any time before the case is closed.” The Fifth Circuit has interpreted this rule to mean that in a voluntary bankruptcy case, a court shall allow a debtor to amend his schedule of exemptions before the case is closed, absent a creditor's showing of the debtor’s bad faith or prejudice to the creditors. Matter of Sandoval, 103 F.3d 20, 21 (5th Cir.1997); Matter of Williamson, 804 F.2d 1355, 1358 (5th Cir.1986). In the case at bar, the Trustee did not argue that the Debtor's amendment of his Schedule C was in bad faith or prejudicial.
