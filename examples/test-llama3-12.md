gold_text: The Town also argues that the availability of post-deprivation grievance procedures in the CBA forecloses Clukey’s claim. It is true that where the grievance procedures contained in a collective bargaining agreement satisfy constitutional due process mínimums, aggrieved employees have little room to claim that they were deprived of a property interest without due process of law. See Chaney v. Suburban Bus Div. of Reg'l Transp. Auth., 52 F.3d 623, 628-30 (7th Cir.1995) (collecting cases). The mere fact that a collective bargaining agreement contains a hearing procedure, however, does not mean that constitutional due process mínimums are satisfied. Rather, grievance procedures extinguish a plaintiffs due process claim only if the procedures meet or exceed constitutional standards. See Cotnoir, 35 F.3d at 12 (holding that failure to provide meaningful notice prior to termination was a violation of public university professor’s procedural due process rights, even where CBA provided for post-termination procedures); see also Ciambriello, 292 F.3d at 319 (“The Constitution, not state law sources such as the CBA, determines what process is due.”); Chaney, 52 F.3d at 629-30 (holding that absent explicit waiver of constitutional right to pre-deprivation process, collective bargaining agreement that provided only post-deprivation process did not satisfy due process); Armstrong v. Meyers, 964 F.2d 948, 950 (9th Cir.1992) (“A public employer may meet its obligation to provide due process through grievance procedures established in a collective bargaining agreement, provided, of course, those procedures satisfy due process.”); Schmidt v. Creedon, 639 F.3d 587, 597-99 (3d Cir.2011) (holding that even where post-deprivation proceedings in collective bargaining agreement are in place, Constitution still requires pre-deprivation process).
