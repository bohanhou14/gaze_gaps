In assessing the propriety of the interest rates proposed by Debtors, the court is guided by the principles set forth in pertinent case law. The determination of market interest rates in cramdown scenarios under 11 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) is complex and must consider the individual characteristics of each creditor/debtor relationship. Notably, in Koopmans, the court rejected the adoption of a rigid formula for interest rates, advocating instead for the bankruptcy court's discretion in making such determinations based on factual risk assessments (301 F.3d 583). The “coerced loan” method from Koopmans supports creditor entitlement to an interest rate that compensates for the risk involved as if they had foreclosed and reinvested (Id.).

Additionally, the principles from Memphis Bank & Trust, expounded in 315 F.3d 671, stress that the appropriate rate in a Chapter 13 cramdown must reflect the current conventional market rate for similar loans, independent of the original contract rate. It underscores an objective valuation to ensure creditors receive the present value of their claims.

Considering these precedents, Debtors’ amendments proposing a 12% interest rate fail to align with the statutory and judicial guidelines mandating individualized risk assessment and appropriate market rate determination. Consequently, Debtors' modifications are inconsistent with the legal requirements elucidated in 301 F.3d 583 and 315 F.3d 671. Accordingly, the proposed modifications are denied for lack of due process and for not satisfying the criteria for a proper market rate determination.
