The court concludes that Cananwill had a perfected, pre-petition security interest in the Debtor’s right to a refund of any unearned insurance premiums paid for the Debtor’s insurance policies. The court finds that Michigan’s insurance premium financing statute, Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 500.1501-500.1514, governs the Premium Finance Agreements between the Debtor and Cananwill, and that the statute bestows validity and perfection on Cananwill’s security interest.

In support of its conclusion, the court relies on reference case 3 B.R. 4, which states that a security interest in unearned insurance premiums attaches and is perfected when a premium financing agreement is entered into and funded. The court also relies on reference case 72 B.R. 208, which holds that a security interest in unearned insurance premiums is not subject to the Bankruptcy Code’s avoidance provisions.

The court distinguishes reference case 2 B.R. 550, which involves a different type of security interest in unearned insurance premiums. In that case, the court held that the security interest did not attach until there was an early cancellation of an insurance policy. However, in the present case, the court finds that the Michigan statute on premium financing agreements bestows validity and perfection on Cananwill’s security interest, regardless of whether the insurance policies were cancelled.

In conclusion, the court finds that Cananwill had a perfected, pre-petition security interest in the Debtor’s right to a refund of any unearned insurance premiums paid for the Debtor’s insurance policies. The court relies on Michigan’s insurance premium financing statute and reference cases 3 B.R. 4 and 72 B.R. 208 in support of its conclusion.
