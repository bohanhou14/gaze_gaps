Regarding Lee’s retaliation claim, we find that the district court was correct in dismissing the claim on procedural grounds. Lee failed to raise the issue of retaliation at the district court level, and thus it cannot be properly considered on appeal. As referenced in Anderson v. Unisys Corp. (47 F.3d 302, 307 n. 14, 8th Cir. 1995), issues not presented to the district court need not be entertained for the first time on appeal (113 F.3d 1498).

Even assuming arguendo that the retaliation claim is considered, Lee has not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate an adverse employment action that constitutes an actionable retaliation under Title VII. Mere hostility and personal animus by supervisors, without a tangible change in duties or conditions, do not meet the threshold of an adverse employment action as outlined in Harlston v. McDonnell Douglas Corp. (37 F.3d 379, 382, 8th Cir. 1994) (127 F.3d 686).

Furthermore, even if Lee perceived McGlone’s actions as retaliatory, the law requires more than evidence of a challenging relationship or negative personal interactions. As stated in Ledergerber (122 F.3d 1142), employment decisions must be grounded in actionable discriminatory behavior, which Lee has failed to substantiate adequately.

Thus, given the lack of procedural adherence and the insufficiency of evidence supporting a material adverse action, we affirm the district court's dismissal of Lee's retaliation claim.

gold_text: We next turn to Lee’s argument that the district court erred in ruling that Lee’s retaliation claim was brought against MeGlone in her individual capacity and, thus, was insufficient to state a claim against the State because Title VII does not impose individual liability on supervisors or co-workers. Lee maintains that her retaliation claim against MeGlone, the employer’s agent, is sufficient to state a claim against the State under a respondeat superior liability theory. Although Lee’s contention may have some merit, Lee failed to raise this argument to the district court. Therefore, we need not consider Lee’s argument raised for the first time on appeal. See Curtis v. Electronics & Space Corp., 113 F.3d 1498, 1503 n. 2 (8th Cir.1997). In any event, after construing the facts in the light most favorable to Lee, we conclude that Lee does not present evidence sufficient to demonstrate any adverse employment action that is actionable under Title VII. See Manning v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., Inc., 127 F.3d 686, 692-93 (8th Cir.1997); Ledergerber v. Stangler, 122 F.3d 1142, 1144-45 (8th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of Lee’s retaliation claim.
