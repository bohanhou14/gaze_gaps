The jurisdiction of the court is a crucial aspect in determining the validity of the classification. According to the Declaratory Judgments Statute, the court has no jurisdiction to entertain an action of this character under the statutes. Reference case 60 S. Ct. 944 supports this notion, stating that the court cannot entertain an action that is not within its jurisdiction. The court's jurisdiction is limited to cases where the United States is the only defendant, and the Secretary of the Treasury and the head of the Civil Service Commission are not parties to this action.

The court's inability to interfere with executive or administrative action is further reinforced by reference case 310 U.S. 371. The court cannot substitute its discretion for that of the administrative officer, and it is not bound to provide a remedy in the courts. The principle is that whenever a statute gives a discretionary power to any person, to be exercised by him, upon his own opinion of certain facts, it is a sound rule of construction, that the statute constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of those facts.

In this case, the Treasury Department and the Civil Service Commission have made a classification that is not arbitrary. The court cannot interfere with this classification, as it is a practical one, dependent upon experience. The court's role is to determine whether there are facts warranting a separate classification, and in this case, the classification is valid.

The plaintiff's duties as a member of the Fraud Unit group were defined by the Regulations (GS 12), and his duties as technical adviser, tax accountant, and auditor were defined by GS 13. The primary obligation of investigating frauds is laid upon the Special Agents, and the Revenue Agent assigned to the fraud group aids them as he also aids the attorneys in the Regional Office when he is promoted to the position of adviser. In the circumstances, the classification of special agents as being primarily engaged in investigating and not so classifying the plaintiff is valid.

In conclusion, the court's jurisdiction is limited, and it cannot entertain an action that is not within its jurisdiction. The court's inability to interfere with executive or administrative action is further reinforced by reference case 310 U.S. 371. The classification made by the Treasury Department and the Civil Service Commission is valid, and the court cannot interfere with it. Therefore, the judgment will be for the defendant, and the plaintiff will take nothing.
