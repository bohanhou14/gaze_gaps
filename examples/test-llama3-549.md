In the cases of Lurton v. Railroad Co. (21 L. Ed. 745) and Railway Co. v. Ives (144 U.S. 417, 12 Sup. Ct. 679, 36 L. Ed. 485), the court has established the principle that negligence is a question of law only when the facts upon which it depends are undisputed, and when the inferences from those facts will not reasonably admit of any other imputation. The distinction between the function of the judge and of the jury in determining a question of negligence is well stated by Lord Chancellor Cairns in Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Jackson, L. R. 3 App. Cases, 193, 197, where he said: "The judge has to say whether any facts have been established by evidence from which negligence may reasonably be inferred; the jurors have to say whether, from those facts when submitted to them, negligence ought to be inferred."

In the case at hand, the court refused to give a charge that would have found the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence for stepping over towards the wall in the dark, instead of stopping and letting his companion pass on and then dropping in behind. The court held that the request did not leave to the jury the consideration of other facts which should have some bearing in determining whether the mere act of "stepping over towards the wall" was an act of negligence. The court also pointed out that the request did not take account of the extent of his side step, nor the width of the sidewalk, or of the lighted path or the character or location of the "debris" referred to, nor of the nearness of the wall toward which he stepped, nor of the reasons which might lead him to do the one thing rather than the other.

The court also cited the case of Railway Co. v. Jackson, L. R. 3 App. Cases, 193, 197, where Lord Chancellor Cairns said: "Negligence is a question of law only when the facts upon which it depends are undisputed, and when the inferences from those facts will not reasonably admit of any other imputation." The court also cited the case of Patton v. Southern Ry. Co., 82 Fed. 979, 27 C. C. A. 287, where it was held that the question of negligence is a question for the jury, and not for the court
