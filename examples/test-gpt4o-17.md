The Supreme Court has clearly delineated the requirements for addressing due process claims, as noted in Cusack and reaffirmed in several decisions. Regardless of procedural missteps, not all governmental actions amount to due process violations. Indeed, in Silverman v. Barry, 845 F.2d 1072, 1080 (D.C.Cir.1988), it was established that only significant infringements prompt relief under § 1983, an assertion further supported by Tri County Industries v. District of Columbia, 104 F.3d 455, 459-60 (D.C.Cir.1997). Additionally, substantive due process is typically reserved for extreme cases due to its "uncanalized discretion" and the potential for extensive federal judicial intervention (Coniston Corp. v. Village of Hoffman Estates, 844 F.2d 461, 465-67 (7th Cir.1988)).

In this case, Zevallos’s arguments fail to demonstrate a substantial infringement that meets these heavy standards. Any procedural errors regarding the loss of evidence or delays do not rise to the level of "grave unfairness" necessary to invoke a substantive due process claim. The district court's affirmation in 845 F.2d 1072 serves to highlight that non-exemplary administrative actions, without more, do not equate to constitutional violations. Thus, Treasury's actions under the constraints and challenges posed by international law enforcement and administrative exigencies remain within permissible bounds.

For the reasons stated, we affirm the district court’s ruling in favor of Treasury.

The district court's judgment is Affirmed.

gold_text: Finally, Zevallos insists that Treasury’s conduct violated his substantive due process rights. We have explained in the past that substantive due process forbids only “egregious government misconduct,” George Wash. Univ. v. District of Columbia, 318 F.3d 203, 209 (D.C.Cir. 2003), involving state officials guilty of “grave unfairness” so severe that it constitutes either “a substantial infringement of state law prompted by personal or group animus,” or “a deliberate flouting of the law that trammels significant personal or property rights,” Silverman v. Barry, 845 F.2d 1072, 1080 (D.C.Cir.1988). “Inadvertent errors, honest mistakes, agency confusion, even negligence in the performance of [official] duties, do not” violate substantive due process rights. Id. Zevallos has not suggested misconduct even approaching this egregious standard. Any error Treasury committed was, at most, the result of mistake or negligence and, as we have pointed out repeatedly, was harmless. Thus we affirm the district court on this score as well.
