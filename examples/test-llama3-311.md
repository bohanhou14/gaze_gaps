The case before us involves the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC) and its alleged failure to ensure the accessibility of courts for a mentally impaired individual, Craig Geness. Geness was held in custody for 3,309 days without a trial, and his case raises questions about the AOPC's liability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

The AOPC claims it is shielded from liability due to sovereign immunity and quasi-judicial immunity. However, we find that the AOPC's status as an entity, rather than a public official, precludes it from claiming quasi-judicial immunity. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has held, "official immunities (judicial, legislative, absolute, qualified, quasi, and so on) are personal defenses designed to protect the finances of public officials whose salaries do not compensate them for the risks of liability under vague and hard-to-foresee constitutional doctrines" (Russell v. Richardson, 905 F.3d 239, 247 (3d Cir. 2018)). Quasi-judicial immunity only extends to claims against government employees sued in their individual capacities, not against entities like the AOPC (502 F.3d 775).

Furthermore, the AOPC's duties as an administrative agency do not involve exercising judicial decision-making powers or sitting as an adjudicative body, unlike judges, who are entitled to quasi-judicial immunity (Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 143-45, 99 S.Ct. 2689 (1979)). The AOPC's role in managing ADA compliance and ensuring accessible courts is administrative in nature, and it does not have the same level of insulation from political influence as judges.

In conclusion, we find that the AOPC is not shielded from liability under the ADA and that Mr. Geness's claims are timely. We grant his motion to proceed with discovery and allow him to proceed with his claims against the AOPC.
