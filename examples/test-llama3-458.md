SUMMARY ORDER
In this case, the petitioners seek review of a March 7, 2007, order of the BIA affirming the January 29, 2002, decision of Immigration Judge (“IJ”) Annette Elstein denying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”).

The petitioners argue that the BIA erred in finding that the IJ correctly applied Acosta to find that landowners do not constitute a particular social group. Specifically, they assert that the BIA did not consider evidence in the record indicating that landowners and businessmen are targeted by guerrilla groups in Colombia. In Matter of A-M-E & J-G-U-, the BIA explained that a particular social group may be defined by a “common, immutable characteristic,” which includes “an innate one such as sex, color, or kinship ties, or in some circumstances it might be a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.” 19 I. & N. Dec. 211, 233 (B.I.A. 1985), overruled, in part on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 I. & N. Dec. 439 (B.I.A.1987). The petitioners argue that the BIA’s failure to consider this evidence in analyzing their proposed social group claim constitutes error.

In Matter of E-P-21 I. & N. Dec. 860, 861 (B.I.A.1997), the BIA noted that the agency has not required asylum applicants “to show conclusively why persecution has occurred or may occur,” but “to demonstrate the reasonableness of a motivation which is related to one of the enumerated grounds” through direct or circumstantial evidence. The petitioners argue that the record shows that the EPL targeted them whenever they went to their farm, and that the EPL escalated its activity against them after they attempted to defy them. They argue that it is reasonable to infer from this circumstantial evidence that the EPL viewed their failure to visit the farm as their refusal to accede to their demands, and that such defiance bears a political dimension.

The petitioners also argue that the BIA erred in finding that they failed to establish that the EPL persecuted them on account of imputed political opinion. They argue that the BIA failed to consider whether the EPL had a mixed motive in targeting

Ashcroft, we interpreted this provision to hold that “torture requires only that government officials know of or remain willfully blind to an act and thereafter breach them legal responsibility to prevent it.” 361 F.3d 161, 171 (2d Cir.2004). We further explained that the acts of private individuals, as Romero alleges, may nevertheless amount to torture if the government of the country where the acts occurred has acquiesced to the acts in violation of its duty to intervene.
