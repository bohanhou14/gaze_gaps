In Prieto-Romero v. Clark, 534 F.3d 1053, the Ninth Circuit held that an alien under a final order of removal, whose removal is stayed pending judicial review, cannot be detained indefinitely under § 1226(a). However, the court also noted that Prieto-Romero's detention was justified as there was a significant likelihood of his removal in the foreseeable future, especially with a bond hearing that provided procedural due process. Similarly, in the present case, petitioner Flores's detention remains justified under Zadvydas v. Davis (388 F.3d 1305), as he has not shown that his removal to Honduras is not significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future. Flores's pursuit of judicial review merely prolongs his detention, echoing the court’s findings in Prieto-Romero and Zadvydas, where prolonged detention due to the detainee's own legal actions does not violate due process rights. Thus, the petition is denied.

gold_text: In the meantime, petitioner’s continued detention is not in violation of his due process rights as long as his removal is reasonably foreseeable. Significantly, petitioner has provided no evidence that DHS will be unable to remove him within a reasonable time following the resolution of his petition for review. Detention during an appellate stay of removal, whether formal or in accordance with the Second Circuit forbearance policy, is not indefinite because the end of the litigation provides a definite end point. See Prieto-Romero v. Clark, 534 F.3d 1053, 1065 (9th Cir.2008) (alien’s lengthy detention not indefinite under INA § 236 where end point foreseeable with conclusion of litigation); Soberanes v. Comfort, 388 F.3d 1305, 1311 (10th Cir.2004) (alien’s detention during judicial review not indefinite because it has a “definite and evidently impending termination point”). Additionally, there is no institutional barrier to petitioner’s removal to Honduras. In recent years, DHS has successfully repatriated thousands of aliens to Honduras.
