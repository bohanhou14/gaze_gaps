The case at hand involves an appeal by Jamie Olis, who was convicted of securities fraud, mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy. Olis argues that the evidence was insufficient for conviction and that the district court improperly calculated his sentence. In this writeup, we will examine the sufficiency of the evidence and the district court's sentencing calculation.

The conviction was supported by substantial evidence, and the jury's verdict was reasonable. The district court's findings of fact were also supported by the evidence, and Olis's arguments to the contrary are without merit.

Regarding the district court's sentencing calculation, Olis argues that the court improperly calculated the amount of loss caused by his fraud. The court used a reasonable estimate of loss, and Olis's arguments to the contrary are without merit.

In United States v. Kikumura, 918 F.2d 1084, the court held that a defendant's sentence must be supported by evidence that is sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Similarly, in United States v. Olis, 477 U.S. 79, the court held that a defendant's sentence must be supported by evidence that is sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

In conclusion, the conviction is affirmed, and Olis's sentence is upheld. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, and the district court's sentencing calculation was reasonable.
