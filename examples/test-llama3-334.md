United States, 114 F.3d 319, 323 n. 8 (1st Cir.1997); cf. Sanchez, 740 F.3d at 53-54 (1st Cir.2014) (referencing Gonzalez, 132 S.Ct. at 648). What constitutes “accrual” within the meaning of the FTCA has been the subject of much debate. “The.general rule, within the meaning of the FTCA, is that a tort claim accrues at the time of the plaintiffs injury.” Skwira v. United States, 344 F.3d 64 (citing Attallah v. United States, 955 F.2d 776, 779 (1st Cir.1992); Gonzalez v. United States, 284 F.3d 281, 288 (1st Cir.2002); and United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 117-18, 100 S.Ct. 352, 62 L.Ed.2d 259 (1979)). However, § 2401(b) is not construed to penalize a plaintiff who in good faith did not know of the existence of the injury or its cause. Therefore, the Supreme Court enacted the discovery rule to endorse this aforementioned policy. See United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 117-18, 100 S.Ct. 352, 62 L.Ed.2d 259 (1979) (creating the discovery rule for medical malpractice claims); see also Rakes, 442 F.3d at 19 (acknowledging the extension of the discovery rule beyond medical malpractice claims to the point of making it a general rule in the First Circuit). The discovery rule states that a claim accrues “once a plaintiff knows, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should know, (1) of [his or] her injury and (2) sufficient facts to permit a reasonable person to believe that there is a causal connection between the government and [his or] her injury.” Callahan v. United States, 426 F.3d 444, 451 (1st Cir.2005) (citing Skwira, 344 F.3d at 78) (emphasis provided). Therefore, the discovery rule operates as an exception to the general time of injury rule. However, the First Circuit has further qualified the aforementioned formulation of the discovery rule as follows:
