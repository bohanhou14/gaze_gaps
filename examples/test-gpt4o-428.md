In Monell, it was established that to hold a municipality liable under § 1983, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the unconstitutional actions were a result of a policy or a well-settled, widespread custom known to the municipality's policymakers. The First Circuit reiterated this in Silva v. Worden, emphasizing that the custom must be so pervasive that the policymaking officials had either actual or constructive knowledge of it (130 F.3d 26, 31).

In cases like Bryan County Comm’rs, the Supreme Court further clarified that the plaintiff must show the custom was so widespread it had the force of law (130 F.3d 26). For instance, in Bisbal-Ramos v. City of Mayagüez, the court found liability when the Municipal Assembly was transformed into a campaign headquarters, indicating a well-known custom causing a deprivation of duties, thus making it actionable (467 F.3d 16, 24).

However, as demonstrated in Esserman, mere isolated incidents or practices not sufficiently widespread do not establish municipal liability. The jury must find the practice was so entrenched and policies were neglected, showing constructive knowledge and inaction from officials (596 F.3d 38, 71). In the present case, Mr. Koolen fails to establish that the Town of Warren had any such widespread custom or policy that led to the alleged violations of his constitutional rights. Therefore, the Court grants the Town of Warren's Motion for Summary Judgment.
