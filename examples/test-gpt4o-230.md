In assessing the Sixth Amendment claim, it is crucial to note that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches only after formal charges have been filed. This is corroborated by the precedent set in the reference cases, where statements made prior to indictment were considered under the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, in Reference Case 704 F.2d 675, the court clarified that since the appellant's incriminating statement was made prior to his arraignment and indictment, it was protected by the Fifth Amendment rather than the Sixth Amendment.

Turning to the Fifth Amendment argument, it is pivotal to examine whether the statements made to the DEA agents en route to arraignment, after the defendant had invoked his right to remain silent, were admissible. The precedent from Reference Case 482 F.2d 807 is instructive here. The court in that case declined to extend the protections established in Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201 (1964), to pre-indictment statements. Similarly, in United States v. Mosley, the court emphasized that invocation of the right to remain silent does not create an indefinite prohibition against further questioning, provided the questioning is non-coercive and respects the defendant’s Miranda rights.

Considering these precedents, the questioning by the DEA agents en route to the arraignment, which did not involve re-administering Miranda warnings and did not comply with the strictures laid out in Miranda, violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights. Therefore, the motion to suppress the statements made during transport to arraignment is granted.

Accordingly, the motion to suppress physical evidence seized and statements made by the defendant is granted in part and denied in part.
