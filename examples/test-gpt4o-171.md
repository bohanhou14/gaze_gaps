As cited in Dorothy J. v. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 7 F.3d 729, a state’s general duty to protect individuals from private violence does not extend to specific environments like schools. This aligns with DeShaney’s precedent that a constitutional duty arises only when the state takes someone into custody, rendering them unable to care for themselves. In Maldonado v. Josey, 975 F.2d 727, the court reiterated that compulsory attendance laws do not strip students of liberty to the extent necessary to impose such a custodial duty.

Further emphasizing this principle, J.O. v. Alton Community Unit Sch. Dist. 11, 909 F.2d 267, confirmed that public schools do not create a constitutional "special relationship" with students that would necessitate affirmative protection against private acts of violence. Consequently, despite the tragedy of Andrew Gaston’s death, these precedents compel the conclusion that DISD and Principal Breedlove did not violate Gaston’s constitutional rights.

Moreover, no allegations suggest that school officials knowingly created an unreasonably dangerous condition or exhibited deliberate indifference, necessary criteria for imposing liability under the state-created danger doctrine. Therefore, following the requirement to state a claim under § 1983 and aligning with the established case law, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

gold_text: . It is Texas law that, with few exceptions, students are required to attend school until they reach the age of 17. See Tex.Educ.Code Ann. § 21.032 (Vemon 1987 & Supp.1993). See also Tex.Educ.Code Ann. § 21.033 (exemptions from compulsory attendance requirements). Further, Texas law requires students usually to attend the public school, often a neighborhood school, designated by the district. See Tex.Educ.Code Ann. § 21.032(a) (Vernon Supp.1993). State law places the school in loco parentis during ordinary school hours and during the conduct of certain school activities. See, e.g., Mercer v. State, 450 S.W.2d 715 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1970, error dism'd as moot). Notwithstanding similar laws in other states, four courts of appeals have held that a student is not "in custody” within DeSha-ney. These courts reason that custody in DeSha-ney meant such an involuntary, full-time physical restraint and superintendence as prevents a person from otherwise independently providing for his needs and safety. See Dorothy I. v. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 7 F.3d 729 (8th Cir.1993); Maldonado v. Josey, 975 F.2d 727, 731 (10th Cir.1992); D.R. v. Middle Bucks Area Vocational Technical Sch., 972 F.2d at 1370-72; J.O. v. Alton Community Unit Sch. Dist. 11, 909 F.2d 267, 272 (7th Cir.1990). Public school attendance is deemed “voluntary” because parents are permitted to withdraw their students from the public schools. Further, parents remain the principal caretakers of their children even though they are housed at school for at least six to eight hours daily.
