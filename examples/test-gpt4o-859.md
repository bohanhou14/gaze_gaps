In addressing Toll's claims, we note pertinent legal precedents. Firstly, the district court's reliance on the premise that no genuine issue of material fact existed regarding the defectiveness of the EIFS and proximate cause was erroneous. Drawing from the principles in 210 F.3d 240, it is clear that issues of fact are generally for the jury to decide and cannot be summarily judged if reasonable disagreement exists. In Silvestri's case, the court vacated summary judgment due to genuine issues about the proximate cause, similarly here, evidence should be evaluated by a jury.

Additionally, the district court's interpretation of contractual indemnity was incorrect. As stated in 395 F.3d 516, signs barring entry indicated a restriction, negating highway status; similarly, the indemnity clause focusing on performance of work does not cover design defects of materials specified by Toll. Thus, any potential liabilities arising from defective EIFS design, as contrasted with improper performance of work, are outside the indemnity scope.

Consequently, we vacate and remand the district court’s judgment regarding the proximate cause and indemnity claims to allow for proper jury determination of these material issues.

Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

gold_text: Appellees maintain that to the extent that summary judgment should otherwise be reversed, it should be affirmed on the basis of spoliation of the evidence. Specifically, Appellees complain of Toll’s removing the EIFS and disposing of it without alerting them or giving them an opportunity to determine if the systems, as they were actually installed, were defective. This court is of course free to affirm a judgment on any ground appearing in the record. See United States v. Smith, 395 F.3d 516, 519 (4th Cir.2005). But, because the district court has not yet addressed the spoliation issue, we will refrain from ruling on it at this time. See Silvestri v. Gen. Motors Corp., 210 F.3d 240, 245 (4th Cir.2000) (holding that the question of whether a case should be dismissed because of spoliation is one for the district court to address in the first instance).
