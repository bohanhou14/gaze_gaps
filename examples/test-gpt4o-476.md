However, the court finds the plaintiff’s reasons insufficient to establish a reasonable apprehension of an infringement suit. In the absence of explicit threats or actions from the patentee creating an objectively reasonable apprehension, jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act is not warranted.

First, the mere absence of an express disclaimer from the defendant does not equate to an implicit threat of litigation. As established in BP Chemicals Ltd. v. Union Carbide Corp., 4 F.3d 975, the use of indirect threats or actions must create a reasonable apprehension of suit; subjective fear is not enough.

Second, the plaintiff’s reference to the defendant’s history of litigation does not meet the threshold for reasonable apprehension. In Deere & Co. v. International Harvester Co., 623 F.2d 1207, the court found that even a patentee’s general determination to defend its patent rights did not establish a reasonable apprehension absent specific threats or actions against the particular declaratory plaintiff.

Finally, past litigation between the parties alone does not suffice to create a reasonable apprehension of future suit. As noted in Gore Enter. Holdings, Inc., 787 F.2d 572, the court focuses on objective words and actions in the present case, not past interactions.

Therefore, considering the totality of circumstances and the lack of objective evidence pointing to an imminent infringement suit, the court grants the defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff has not met the required burden to invoke this court’s declaratory judgment jurisdiction.

gold_text: To begin with, the court recognizes that none of the plaintiffs three stated reasons creates a reasonable apprehension in and of itself. See, e.g., BP Chems. Ltd. v. Union Carbide Corp., 4 F.3d 975, 980 (Fed.Cir.1993) (stating that “[although a patentee’s refusal to give assurances that it will not enforce its patent is relevant to the determination, this factor is not dispos-itive”) (internal citation omitted); Int’l Harvester, Co. v. Deere, Co., 623 F.2d 1207, 1212 (7th Cir.1980) (concluding that the plaintiff did not establish a reasonable apprehension of suit even when other litigation was pending between the two parties); Premo Pharm. Labs. v. Pfizer Pharms., Inc., 465 F.Supp. 1281, 1283-84 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (holding that a history of litigiousness by the defendant does not, by itself, support a reasonable apprehension of suit). Of course, whether the totality of the circumstances, as opposed to each fact individually, causes a reasonable apprehension of suit is a closer call.
