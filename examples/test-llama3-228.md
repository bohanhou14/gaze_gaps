In this case, the district court correctly dismissed the claims brought under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, and 1985(3) without prejudice, as they failed to state a claim. The complaint alleged that the City, with the agreement and assistance of the FOP, used race and national origin as a motivating factor in the promotion of Chicago police detectives, in violation of the plaintiffs' right to equal protection and rights under Title VII. However, the allegations fell short of an intent to deprive white officers of equal protection, which is a requirement for claims under § 1983 or § 1985(3). (Becker v. Contoure Laboratories, Inc., 279 U.S. 388 (1929); Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corporation, 456 U.S. 461 (1982)).

The § 1981 claim, which was dismissed on the pleadings without prejudice, also failed to meet the intent requirement. Section 1981 prohibits discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts, and the plaintiff must prove intentional discrimination to prevail. (Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164 (1989); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160 (1976)).

Regarding the Title VII claim, the district court correctly applied the Full Faith and Credit Act, which provides that state court judgments have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States as they do in the courts of the rendering state. (28 U.S.C. § 1738). The court correctly concluded that the state court judgment precluded the plaintiff's Title VII claim, as the state court had already addressed the issue of the FOP's actions in the promotion process. (Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corporation, 456 U.S. 461 (1982)).

In summary, the district court correctly dismissed the claims brought under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, and 1985(3) without prejudice, as they failed to state a claim. The Title VII claim was also correctly dismissed under the Full Faith and Credit Act, as the state court judgment precluded the plaintiff's claim. (470 U.S. 373; 456 U.S. 461)

gold_text: The fact that a judgment incorporates the results of a settlement, rather than being the result of full litigation on the merits, makes no difference for the application of § 1738. This, indeed, was the situation in Matsushita, where the Court expressly held that a state court judgment embodying the settlement of class action claims had to be assessed under § 1738, just like any other judgment. Furthermore, the Matsushita Court reiterated that § 1738 also applies even when the state court judgment might work to bar litigation of exclusively federal claims, as the Court had held in Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 380, 105 S.Ct. 1327, 1331-32, 84 L.Ed.2d 274 (1985). Finally, in a decision with facts close to those at hand here, the Court concluded in Kremer that state court proceedings might be issue pre-clusive in Title VII suits in federal court. 456 U.S. 461, 470-72, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 1891-92, 72 L.Ed.2d 262.
