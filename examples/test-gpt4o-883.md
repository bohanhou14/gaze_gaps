Turning to the determination of just compensation, guidance can be found in established case law. The Supreme Court has indicated that the proper measure of compensation for a temporary taking is the rental value for the period of occupancy (see United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U.S. 372, 376 (1946); Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 1, 7 (1949)). In evaluating just compensation, courts must determine what a willing lessee would pay in rent as agreed upon in a hypothetical market transaction (see United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 381 (1945)). Moreover, compensation must align with the fair market value of the property for the duration of the occupancy rather than any historical or acquired value resultant from government actions (see United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., 229 U.S. 53, 66 (1913)).

In the present case, the calculation should consider the temporary nature of the FAA's occupation post-lease expiration and apply a fair rental valuation consistent with precedents (see, e.g., United States v. Dow, 482 U.S. 304, 318 (1987)). Any deviation from this principle, such as factoring increased value due to anticipated government projects, would be impermissible (see United States v. Miller, 317 U.S. 369, 381 (1943)). Therefore, further proceedings will focus on establishing this rental value as just compensation while ensuring all relevant evidence and factors analogous to the referenced cases are thoroughly examined and applied appropriately.

gold_text: The government’s suggestion that discovery in this case be keyed to the time the condemnation action is filed raises a concern. In their preparations for trial, the parties should keep in mind that the measure for just compensation for a temporary taking almost certainly will differ from that applied in a condemnation action in district court. Just compensation requires that an aggrieved property owner “be put in as good a position pecuniarily as if his property had not been taken.” Olson v. United States, 292 U.S. 246, 255, 54 S.Ct. 704, 78 L.Ed. 1236 (1934); see also United States v. Miller, 317 U.S. 369, 373, 63 S.Ct. 276, 87 L.Ed. 336 (1943). For a permanent taking, courts typically measure just compensation by reference to the fair market value of the property taken. See, e.g., United States v. Fifty Acres of Land, 469 U.S. 24, 29, 105 S.Ct. 451, 83 L.Ed.2d 376 (1984); United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., 229 U.S. 53, 81, 33 S.Ct. 667, 57 L.Ed. 1063 (1913). However, just compensation for a temporary taking, which denies a landowner use of his or her property only for a finite period of time, frequently is measui’ed by the fair market rental value of the property. See First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304, 315-18, 107 S.Ct. 2378, 96 L.Ed.2d 250 (1987) (discussing the decisions in Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 1, 7, 69 S.Ct. 1434, 93 L.Ed. 1765 (1949); United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U.S. 372, 377-81, 66 S.Ct. 596, 90 L.Ed. 729 (1946); and United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 379-84, 65 S.Ct. 357, 89 L.Ed. 311 (1945)); see also Niagara Falls Bridge Comm’n, 76 F.Supp. at 1019. “[S]ince a transfer brought about by eminent domain is not a voluntary exchange, this [rental] amount can be determined only by a guess, as well informed as possible, as to what the equivalent would probably have been had a voluntary exchange taken place.” Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 6, 69 S.Ct. 1434.
