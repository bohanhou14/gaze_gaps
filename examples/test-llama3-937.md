The defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted as to the claim for strict products liability, breach of implied warranty, and breach of express warranty. The plaintiff has failed to adduce any evidence that a substantial number of persons suffer any allergic reaction to Lactaid, let alone the one described in the case. The defendant's product has been used regularly and safely by millions of people for nearly ten years, and the plaintiff has not offered any evidence to refute this safety record (814 F.2d 120).

The plaintiff's claim for breach of implied warranty also fails. The implied warranty of merchantability is breached if the good is not fit for the ordinary purpose for which it is used (Jones v. Lederle Labs., 695 F.Supp. 700, 709 (E.D.N.Y.1988)). However, the plaintiff has failed to show that she was one of a substantial number or of an identifiable class of persons who were allergic to the defendant's product, and the defendant's product has been widely used and tolerated by the public without adverse reactions (Hafner v. Guerlain, 34 A.D.2d 162, 164, 310 N.Y.S.2d 141 (1st Dep't 1970)).

The plaintiff's claim for breach of express warranty also fails, as the defendant's representative did not make any express warranties that were not consistent with the product's labeling and advertising (Mack v. United States, 814 F.2d 120).

In conclusion, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted as to all claims, and the case is dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiff has failed to adduce any evidence that a substantial number of persons suffer any allergic reaction to Lactaid, and the defendant's product has been widely used and tolerated by the public without adverse reactions. The defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted, and the case is dismissed with prejudice.

gold_text: Under the law in this Circuit, a Court considering a motion for summary judgment may not rely on an affidavit that contradicts a party’s deposition testimony. Mack v. United States, 814 F.2d 120, 124 (2d Cir.1987) (“It is well settled in this circuit that a party’s affidavit which contradicts his own prior deposition testimony should be disregarded on a motion for summary judgment”); Raskin v. The Wyatt Company, 125 F.3d 55, 63 (2d Cir.1997) (“[W]e follow the rule that a party may not create an issue of fact by submitting an affidavit in opposition to a summary judgment motion that, by omission or addition, contradicts the affiant’s previous deposition testimony.”). In the present case, there is a conflict between the plaintiffs sworn testimony and her affidavit. The former indicates that plaintiff did not advise McNeil of her specific symptoms in 1997, while the affidavit drafted for this motion avers the contrary. I must treat plaintiffs deposition testimony as true for purposes of this motion.
