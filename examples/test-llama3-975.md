The prison officials argue that the district court erred in denying their request for summary judgment as to the inmates' other complaints. The officials assert that they were entitled to summary judgment on the merits and on the basis of qualified immunity. However, the district court's order only addressed the inmates' due process claims, and did not discuss the merits of the additional claims or the officials' qualified immunity defense as it related to those claims. In fact, the district court merely ordered "that defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied."

As stated in 991 F.2d 435, a district court order holding that government defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity is immediately appealable as a final order under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (1988). Therefore, the officials' appeal of the district court's denial of their request for summary judgment on the merits and on qualified immunity grounds is dismissed.

In conclusion, the district court's grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the inmates on their due process claims is affirmed, and the officials' qualified immunity defense is rejected. The officials' appeal of the district court's denial of their request for summary judgment on the merits and on qualified immunity grounds is dismissed. The case is remanded for further proceedings on the inmates' claims.

The prison officials' argument that they were entitled to summary judgment on the merits and on qualified immunity grounds is rejected. As stated in 992 F.2d 791, a district court's grant of summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no dispute as to any genuine issue of material fact and the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

gold_text: When the order appealed from does not decide the issue of qualified immunity, this court lacks jurisdiction to decide it. Moutray v. Butts, 985 F.2d 426, 427 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 69, 126 L.Ed.2d 38 (1993); Shannon v. White, 992 F.2d 791, 792-93 (8th Cir.1993). In Moutray, we held that we lacked jurisdiction because the district court’s order dealt with summary judgment only as to the merits and did not discuss qualified immunity. 985 F.2d at 427. Similarly, in Shannon, we held that we lacked jurisdiction where the district court adopted two magistrate judge’s reports without comment and neither report discussed qualified immunity. 992 F.2d at 792-93. Although we determined that we had jurisdiction in Krueger v. Fuhr, 991 F.2d 435, 438 n. 2 (8th Cir.1993), the district court there denied the motion for summary judgment, but at least noted that the qualified immunity defense had been argued. Here, the district court did not discuss the qualified immunity defense as to the inmates’ additional claims. As there is no ruling as to qualified immunity on these issues, we have no basis for reaching the merits. We must, therefore, remand to the district court for further proceedings.
