B. Genuine Issue of Material Fact Regarding the Truth of the Statement

Kirsch argues that there exists a genuine issue of material fact regarding the truthfulness of the statements in the Notice to Bookmen. In determining whether summary judgment was appropriate, the district court was required to establish that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that Brown University was entitled to judgment as a matter of law (328 U.S. 1; 528 F.2d 727). The burden of proving the nonexistence of any genuine issue of fact lay with Brown University, the moving party (487 F.2d 804).

The district court found that the statements in the Notice to Bookmen were substantially true: Kirsch had not delivered Lovecraft materials to Brown as promised, and Brown had not authorized him to solicit such materials. The court also determined that the language of the Notice was reasonably capable of a defamatory meaning but ruled there was no genuine issue as to the substantial truth of the statements (528 F.2d 727).

Kirsch contends that the circumstances under which he retained the materials involved disputed facts, such as whether he had intended to donate the materials to Brown and whether Brown had implicit knowledge or authorization of his actions. However, courts have consistently emphasized that the absence of genuine issues of material fact must be clear to uphold summary judgment (487 F.2d 804). Given that the record supports the district court's finding of substantial truth, we find no error in the granting of summary judgment.

Accordingly, the district court's judgment dismissing Kirsch's counterclaim for libel is affirmed.
