GC Services argues that the proposed class does not meet certain prerequisites mandated by Rule 23(a), particularly the adequacy of representation under Rule 23(a)(4). To examine this claim, we turn to case law guiding Rule 23 cases. In reference case 963 F.2d 1013, Rosario v. Livaditis, the court found that to meet Rule 23(a)(4), the chosen class representative must not have conflicting interests with the class members, must possess a sufficient interest to ensure vigorous advocacy, and must have competent counsel.

GC Services suggests that Gammon is not adequately informed about the case and has a limited understanding of his role. However, the mere lack of sophistication or limited understanding of the law does not automatically disqualify a class representative (Eggleston v. Chicago Journeymen Plumbers’ Local Union No. 130, 657 F.2d 890 (7th Cir.1981)). Furthermore, reference case 713 F.2d 225 notes that the typicality requirement overlaps with concerns of commonality and adequate representation. Given that Gammon's claims reflect those of the class, his position is consistent with typicality.

The adequacy of counsel is another critical point of contention. Citing reference case 102 F.R.D. 944, the Court concludes that the consistency and expertise demonstrated by Gammon's attorneys in previous FDCPA class actions support their adequacy. Therefore, Rule 23(a)(4)’s requirement is satisfied as Gammon’s interests align with those of the class and his attorneys are competent and experienced.

Accordingly, Gammon’s motion for class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) aligns with the requisite legal standards and is thus granted.

gold_text: . The Court's own independent review of these criteria also finds the numerosity, commonality and typicality prerequisites to be satisfied by the plaintiff class. First, the proposed class consists of four million individuals, and thus is clearly "so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable." Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(1). Second, the fact that GC Services sent the same standard debt collection letter to all members of the proposed class suffices to provide a "common nucleus of operative fact,” see Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir.1992) (citing Franklin v. City of Chicago, 102 F.R.D. 944, 949-50 (N.D.Ill. 1984)), thereby satisfying Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality requirement. Third, the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3) is satisfied because Gammon’s claim rests on the theory that GC Services' standard debt collection letter violates the FDCPA, and thus arises "from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and [is] based on the same legal theory.” De La Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir.1983) (quoting H. Newberg, Class Actions § 115(b) at 185 (1977)).
