Continuing with the case at hand, it is important to underscore that the district court's judgment is well-supported by relevant legal precedents. In applying Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it was determined that there exists "no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law" (477 U.S. 317). The summary judgment standard requires that the facts be reviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, here Mrs. Sims (784 F.2d 577), and it was thus with this standard that the district court made its decision.

The pivotal case, Celotex Corp. v. Catrett (477 U.S. 317), as referenced, further supports the notion that summary judgment is appropriate when the record as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party. Applying this to our case, the undisputed facts and expert testimony demonstrate that Mr. Brumfield's death resulted directly or indirectly from an intentionally self-inflicted injury. The critical question is not whether the death was accidental but whether the injury leading to death was intentionally inflicted.

Further solidifying this interpretation, the Fifth Circuit in Reid v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (784 F.2d 577) emphasized that summary judgment is indeed appropriate when policy language is unambiguous and applicability turns purely on legal interpretation rather than factual disputes. Given these precedents, the district court correctly held that the exclusion applied to Mr. Brumfield’s case.

Thus, with no substantial factual disagreements and clear application of law, the summary judgment favoring Monumental General Insurance Company is affirmed.

gold_text: The only case cited by Mrs. Sims that holds that partial strangulation is not an injury is Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. v. Tommie, 619 S.W.2d 199 (Tex. Civ.App.—Texarkana 1981, writ ref’d n.r.e.). That case, however, was in an entirely different procedural posture than the instant case. In Tommie, the Texas intermediate appellate court was reviewing a jury finding that partial strangulation did not constitute an injury under Texas law. The Texarkana court, constrained by its standard of review, held that “some probative evidence” introduced in the trial court tended to support the jury’s finding, which the appellate court was therefore required to affirm. Id. at 203. The record in the case at bar, however, does not raise any genuine issue of material fact, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Mrs. Sims. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Reid v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 784 F.2d 577, 578 (5th Cir.1986).
