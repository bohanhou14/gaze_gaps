In addressing Mr. Kussmaul's claim of entrapment regarding the charge of mailing obscene material, pertinent legal precedents must be considered. Notably, the Supreme Court in Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974), clarified that under 18 U.S.C. § 1461, the requisite knowledge for conviction is satisfied if the defendant knew the character and nature of the materials, without needing to know the materials were deemed legally obscene. This is in line with the findings in United States v. Hurt, 795 F.2d 765 (9th Cir.1986), which established that circumstantial evidence can prove a defendant's knowledge of the material's nature, further corroborating the assertion that Kussmaul's predisposition was clear from his prompt and unsolicited responses. The instruction requiring the Government to demonstrate the defendant's awareness of the material character, rather than its legal status, aligns with established case law and rejects his entrapment defense.

Whether the defendant knew that the videos he expected Artiste Internationale to send him were obscene by legal definition does not matter for the purpose of the Government’s proof of conviction. "[Under 18 U.S.C. § 1461, i]t is constitutionally sufficient that the prosecution show that a defendant had knowledge of the contents of the materials he distributed, and that he knew of the character and nature of the materials." Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 124, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2911, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974). This knowledge may be proven by circumstantial evidence, for example that the person ordering the material knew it contained sexually explicit conduct or that he was a regular consumer of such materials. United States v. Hurt, 795 F.2d 765, 773-74 (9th Cir.1986), amended, rehearing denied, en banc, 808 F.2d 707 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 816, 108 S.Ct. 69, 98 L.Ed.2d 33 (1987) (following Hamling).
