In the context of the alleged harassment in Count IV, the Court must determine whether Nutt's actions meet the legal threshold for "outrageous conduct" under Florida law. As Florida case law elucidates, not all instances of harassment, even when reprehensible, meet this standard. For instance, in Vance v. Southern Bell, 983 F.2d 1573, the court held that racially hostile misconduct did not rise to the degree of "outrageousness or atrociousness" required to sustain a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Similarly, Mundy v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 676 F.2d 503, reaffirmed that conduct must be truly extreme and beyond all bounds of decency to be actionable.

Applying these precedents, the Court must assess whether Nutt's conduct, as described by Plaintiffs, reaches the stringent threshold of "outrageousness" mandated by Florida law. Despite the severe and distressing nature of the alleged harassment, it is akin to the conduct in the aforementioned cases, which courts found insufficiently "outrageous" or "extreme" to sustain claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Consequently, Plaintiffs have not met the necessary burden to establish that Nutt’s actions rise to this elevated level, and therefore, Count IV fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

Accordingly, Defendant Nutt’s Motion to Dismiss Count IV is granted.
