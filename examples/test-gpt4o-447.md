In addressing the primary question regarding the venue provisions under the Jones Act, it is essential to consider the historic flexibility of admiralty jurisdiction. According to Justice Story’s Commentaries on the Constitution (20 How. 583, 61 U.S. 583), admiralty jurisdiction is not inherently exclusive but concurrent with common law in certain matters. This reinforces the idea that maritime jurisprudence allows such flexibility in venue, supporting the argument against the narrow application of the Jones Act's venue provisions.

The District Court's relationship with admiralty law is well-defined, highlighting that admiralty jurisdiction can be invoked wherever the litigation involves maritime matters (20 How. 583; 61 U.S. 583). In light of this, the venue restrictions applied to actions at law under the Jones Act should not constrict the established venue flexibility in admiralty cases. Given this context, the decision to permit initiating an action in personam in admiralty under the Jones Act in districts where the employer does not reside aligns with the longstanding principles of admiralty jurisdiction. 

Thus, the appeal's consideration must reflect the distinctive nature of admiralty laws, which allows the preservation of ancient maritime rights, including foreign attachment, to ensure comprehensive judicial access and uphold the seaman's substantive rights as intended within the framework of maritime law.

In conclusion, the district court’s jurisdiction in admiralty should not be curtailed by the venue provisions of the Jones Act, supporting the appeal to reinstate the libel including all claims founded upon the Jones Act.
