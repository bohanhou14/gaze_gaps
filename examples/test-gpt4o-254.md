Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1), we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been exhausted before the BIA. As stated in Sundar v. INS, 328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003), the exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional. Here, Duran-Quiroz failed to exhaust his administrative remedies regarding his CAT claim before the BIA, requiring dismissal of this part of his petition.

Regarding his claim for withholding of removal and cancellation of removal, the adverse credibility determination was a crucial factor. Just as in Amaya's case (463 F.3d 1247), where the IJ required corroborating evidence and found the petitioner incredulous due to discrepancies, the IJ in Duran-Quiroz's case found inconsistencies in testimony and application details. These included contradictory statements about his imprisonment duration in Nicaragua, which supported the IJ's and BIA's adverse credibility finding—echoing the rationale in Dailide v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 387 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2004).

Additionally, under the highly deferential substantial-evidence test as articulated in Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001), and Forgue v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005), the record supports the IJ's and BIA's findings. Thus, Duran-Quiroz’s petition for asylum and withholding of removal fails on grounds of adverse credibility and insufficient corroboration, aligning with decisions like Zheng v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 451 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2006).

Therefore, we dismiss Duran-Quiroz’s unexhausted claims and deny his other petitions due to substantial evidence supporting the adverse credibility determination and the insufficiency of corroborating evidence.

gold_text: On appeal, Duran-Quiroz argues for the first time that the Supreme Court’s decision in Vartelas v. Holder, — U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1479, 182 L.Ed.2d 473 (2012) invalidates the IJ’s and BIA’s finding that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal. We review our subject-matter jurisdiction de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). In a petition for review, we generally only have jurisdiction to consider claims that have been administratively exhausted. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1); Sundar v. I.N.S., 328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, we generally lack jurisdiction to review claims not raised before the BIA. Amaya-Artunduaga, 463 F.3d at 1250. Although some claims may not require exhaustion because the BIA does not have the power to adjudicate those claims, where the BIA can remedy a claim, the exhaustion requirement applies with full force. See Sundar, 328 F.3d at 1325.
