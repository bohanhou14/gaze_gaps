As previously noted, the core issue in Rolling's case revolves around whether subsequent sentencing subjected him to a higher penalty than originally imposed, thereby violating his double jeopardy and due process rights. In regard to the Double Jeopardy Clause, it is pertinent to consider United States v. Edick, 603 F.2d 772 (9th Cir. 1979), where the court vacated an improper consecutive sentence. However, the principles set forth in Edick appear to have been questioned by DiFrancesco, given that the latter case highlighted that the finality of a sentence does not attach when the defendant starts serving it if there's no reasonable expectation of finality (449 U.S. at 132, 101 S.Ct. at 434). This principle aligns with our current context where corrections are mandated by statutory law rather than vindictiveness.

Likewise, in the context of legitimate expectations, the ruling in reference case 722 F.2d 632 is relevant as it emphasized that a defendant's expectations are integral to double jeopardy considerations. Nonetheless, DiFrancesco elucidated that due process protection is less compelling when addressing sentencing corrections post-conviction (101 S.Ct. at 437). Given this, the augmentation of Rolling's sentence to align with statutory mandates does not constitute a due process violation when considering these precedents.

In light of these references, the imposition of a corrected and statutorily compliant sentence under the Nebraska Habitual Criminal Act is justified, disallowing claims of unfair resentencing or constitutional violations.
