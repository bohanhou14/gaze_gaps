Cuevas argues that under the totality-of-the-circumstances approach established in *Fare v. Michael C.*, his waiver of Miranda rights was invalid due to his age and the absence of his mother. Referencing *Fare*, 442 U.S. at 725, Cuevas contends that his request to speak to his mother before confessing is tantamount to invoking his right to counsel, drawing a parallel to the Court's analysis of a juvenile's understanding and capacity to waive their rights. However, as in *Fare* (442 U.S. at 719), Cuevas’ mother is not a trained legal advisor, hence her presence would not equate to legal counsel.

Moreover, the ruling in *Fare* is reinforced by *Reference case 653 F.2d 1153*, which held that a juvenile’s request for a parent does not function as a request for an attorney, emphasizing the importance of legal training for advising a suspect. Similarly, *United States v. Wilderness*, 160 F.3d 1173, noted that federal law does not mandate parental presence for a juvenile's confession to be valid. Cuevas’ assertion about needing parental presence therefore lacks merit.

Addressing Cuevas' claim regarding the trial counsel's deficiency, it’s significant to consider *Reference case 148 F.3d 747*, which highlighted the necessity of an evidentiary hearing to establish competency. In contrast with *148 F.3d 747*, Cuevas’ trial counsel's failure to move for suppression was not unreasonable given the corroborative testimonies and evidence presented, undermining the likelihood of a different trial outcome.

Considering these precedents, Cuevas fails to demonstrate both deficient performance and resulting prejudice under *Strickland* criteria. Thus, the state's adjudication aligns with established federal law, leading to the affirmation of the district court's judgment and denial of Cuevas’ motion to expand the certificate of appealability.

gold_text: Since Fare was decided, this court has expanded the list of relevant factors. For example, in U.S. ex rel. Riley v. Franzen, 653 F.2d 1153, 1161 (7th Cir.1981), this court held that “a request which manifests the juvenile’s desire to see his parent in order to obtain an attorney must be treat ed differently from a request ... in which there is no such manifestation.” Ultimately, the focus of the inquiry is whether the police engaged in abusive practices, not whether the juvenile offender wisely waived his rights to remain silent and to an attorney. Rice v. Cooper, 148 F.3d 747, 750-51 (7th Cir.1998) {Miranda waiver by mentally retarded, 16-year-old defendant was valid where police reasonably believed the defendant understood the rights he was waiving).
