The questions presented in these reference cases involve the constitutional requirements for obtaining a state search warrant and the applicability of a state statute regulating the dissemination of gambling information.

In the case of 378 U.S. 108, the Supreme Court held that a search warrant issued without probable cause is unconstitutional. The Court stated that the Fourth Amendment requires that a search warrant be issued only upon a showing of probable cause, and that the warrant must particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.

In the case of 393 U.S. 410, the Supreme Court held that a state statute regulating the dissemination of gambling information is unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The Court stated that the statute was overly broad and that it prohibited the dissemination of information that was protected by the First Amendment.

The case at bar presents a similar issue, as it involves the applicability of a state statute regulating the dissemination of gambling information. However, unlike the case of 393 U.S. 410, the statute at issue in this case is not overly broad and does not prohibit the dissemination of information that is protected by the First Amendment.

In this case, the defendant, Angelini, was convicted of violating the Illinois gambling law by transmitting information about sporting events to bookmakers and gamblers. The evidence showed that Angelini transmitted the information for the purpose of facilitating gambling, and that he knowingly transmitted the information to persons engaged in gambling activities.

The issue in this case is whether the Illinois gambling law is unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The court must determine whether the law is overly broad and whether it prohibits the dissemination of information that is protected by the First Amendment.

In conclusion, the case at bar presents a similar issue to the case of 393 U.S. 410, but with a different outcome. The Illinois gambling law is not unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it does not prohibit the dissemination of information that is protected by the First Amendment.
