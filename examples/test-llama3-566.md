In the context of bankruptcy cases, it is crucial to determine the appropriate method for calculating the market rate of interest under ยง 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii). The reference case 105 F.3d 55 provides guidance on this issue, holding that the market rate of interest should be fixed at the rate on a United States Treasury instrument with a maturity equivalent to the repayment schedule under the debtor's reorganization plan. This approach is preferred because it is easy to apply, objective, and leads to uniform results.

In contrast, the "cost of funds" approach and the "forced loan" approach are less desirable. The reference case 962 F.2d 176 supports this conclusion, stating that the "cost of funds" approach is not persuasive because it does not consider the risk premium associated with delayed payments. Similarly, the "forced loan" approach is problematic because it does not account for the debtor's ability to repay the debt.

In the context of the present case, it is essential to consider the Bank's claim as secured by a security interest in the Debtors' principal residence and a judicial lien in the 60-acre tract of real property. The reference case 105 F.3d 55 is relevant here, as it emphasizes the importance of considering the Bank's claim as secured by a security interest in the Debtors' principal residence.

In conclusion, the market rate of interest should be calculated using the approach outlined in reference case 105 F.3d 55, which considers the rate on a United States Treasury instrument with a maturity equivalent to the repayment schedule under the debtor's reorganization plan. This approach is preferred because it is easy to apply, objective, and leads to uniform results.
