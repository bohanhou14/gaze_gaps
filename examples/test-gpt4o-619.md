B. Withholding of Removal and Protection under the Convention Against Torture

Given that Singh’s asylum claim does not succeed, we likewise affirm the denial of his requests for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Both forms of relief require a higher standard of proof than asylum, as established in Ahmed (348 F.3d 611). To qualify for withholding of removal, Singh needed to show that it is more likely than not he would face persecution upon return to India, a stricter criterion than the “well-founded fear” standard for asylum (see INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 429-30).

Similarly, Singh’s claims under CAT must demonstrate that it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to India (see Mekhtiev, 559 F.3d 725). As noted in Zhu (465 F.3d 316), since Singh did not meet the lesser burden for asylum, he necessarily fails to meet the higher burden for withholding of removal and protection under CAT. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports IJ Zerbe and the BIA's conclusions to deny Singh's petitions for withholding of removal and CAT protection.

III. Conclusion

For the reasons set forth, we deny Singh’s petition for review.

gold_text: As we have said many times before, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture are more limited remedies than asylum. See, e.g., Hao Zhu v. Gonzales, 465 F.3d 316, 322 (7th Cir.2006); Ahmed v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 611, 619 (7th Cir.2003). Therefore, a party who does not qualify for asylum necessarily does not qualify for these remedies either. See, e.g., Mekhtiev v. Holder, 559 F.3d 725, 731 (7th Cir.2009); Dandan, 339 F.3d at 575 n. 7. Because we have upheld the BIA’s decision to deny asylum, Singh is also not entitled to these other forms of relief.
