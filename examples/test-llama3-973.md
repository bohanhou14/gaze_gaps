The reference cases 595 F.2d 948 and 58 F.R.D. 453 provide valuable insights into the issue of assessing costs against in forma pauperis litigants. In these cases, the courts have consistently held that the district court has the discretion to assess costs against such litigants.

In the case of 595 F.2d 948, the court held that the district court's decision to tax costs pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e) was a reasonable alternative that served to assure that litigants would assess the relative merits and risks of litigation before proceeding. The court noted that the assessment of costs in other cases is generally controlled by Fed.R.Civ. Pro. 54(d), which provides that costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.

In the case of 58 F.R.D. 453, the court emphasized the need for courts to exercise discretion in assessing costs against in forma pauperis litigants. The court noted that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are inadequate to protect the courts and defendants from frivolous litigation, and that the district court's discretion to dismiss under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) is a means of allowing the court to exercise some control over its docket by removing frivolous or malicious cases.

In light of these reference cases, it is clear that the district court has the discretion to assess costs against in forma pauperis litigants. The court's discretion in this regard is not unlimited, and the court must consider the individual circumstances of each case. However, the reference cases make it clear that the court's discretion is broad and that the assessment of costs is a reasonable alternative for ensuring that litigants assess the relative merits and risks of litigation before proceeding.

In conclusion, the reference cases 595 F.2d 948 and 58 F.R.D. 453 provide guidance on the issue of assessing costs against in forma pauperis litigants. The courts have consistently held that the district court has the discretion to assess costs against such litigants, and that the assessment of costs is a reasonable alternative for ensuring that litigants assess the relative merits and risks of litigation before proceeding.

However, we adopt the district court’s reasoning that references to immunity from costs apparently “indicate the inability of a court or prevailing party to enforce a judgment against one who has no money rather than indicating any shield erected by the grant of in forma pauperis status.” 80 F.R.D. at 28.
