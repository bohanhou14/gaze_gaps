In considering whether the stipulated judgment of $1,197,500 should be set aside, it is necessary to evaluate the nature of authority exercised by the Assistant U.S. Attorney. The core issue is whether this authority was properly delegated and executed.

As established in case law, an agent's lack of awareness concerning the limitations of their authority does not exempt their actions from being scrutinized against the established legal boundaries. Specifically, in 332 U.S. 380, it was evident that agents cannot bind the government to unauthorized actions, regardless of their knowledge or intent. Echoing this sentiment, the decision in Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, 243 U.S. 389, highlighted that uses of federal land which exceed the granted permissions must be rectified.

The Assistant U.S. Attorney's unauthorized settlement falls outside the permissible scope defined by federal regulations, as delineated in the referenced cases. In compliance with United States v. Beebe, 180 U.S. 343, settlements entered without appropriate authority necessitate setting aside the resultant judgments. Therefore, following these principles, the judgment here, premised on an unauthorized compromise, qualifies for annulment.

In conclusion, the stipulated judgment must be vacated, consistent with the precedents and guidelines established in 332 U.S. 380 and 243 U.S. 389.
