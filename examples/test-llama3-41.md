The court's decision to allow the hearsay testimony about Dusty Wooten's statement about McClain's predisposition to commit the offense is inconsistent with the principles of the hearsay doctrine. The testimony was admitted as evidence to show McClain's predisposition to commit the crime, but it was based on an anonymous informant's statement, which is unreliable.

The Fifth Circuit's decision in United States v. Washington, 275 F.2d 687, 690 (5th Cir. 1960), which allowed the admission of similar hearsay testimony, has been criticized for its lack of rationale. The court's decision was based on the notion that the government agent's good faith belief that the defendant was a dealer was sufficient to establish the defendant's predisposition to commit the crime. However, this approach is flawed because it relies on unreliable hearsay evidence.

The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 427 (1972), emphasized the importance of the defendant's state of mind in determining predisposition. However, the Fifth Circuit's approach ignores this principle and instead focuses on the government agent's good faith belief.

The admission of this hearsay testimony also undermines the principle of due process, as it allows the government to introduce unreliable evidence without any basis for its reliability. The testimony was admitted without any opportunity for the defendant to cross-examine the witness or to verify the accuracy of the statement.

In conclusion, the court's decision to admit the hearsay testimony about Dusty Wooten's statement is inconsistent with the principles of the hearsay doctrine and due process. The testimony was unreliable and lacked any basis for its reliability. This decision undermines the integrity of the criminal justice system and raises concerns about the reliability of the evidence used to convict defendants.

gold_text: Our own decisions are not in very good array. In Carlton v. United States, 9 Cir., 1952, 198 F.2d 795, 797, we held that the defendant’s “record of previous convictions of similar or related criminal offenses, both misdemeanors and felonies ” are admissible as “rebuttal evidence after the defendant has introduced a defense of entrapment.” (p. 797; emphasis in original.) Trice v. United States, 9 Cir., 1954, 211 F.2d 513, is similar to Washington v. United States, supra, in holding that hearsay evidence that Trice was an opium dealer was admissible, not to prove the truth of the hearsay, but to prove the good faith of the government agent. (211 F.2d at 516-518) It bears emphasizing that defense counsel in Trice did not object. This is not a holding that such evidence is admissible to prove Trice's predisposition.
