In the context of legal cases, the concept of personal privilege is crucial in determining the extent to which individuals can withhold information or records from the government. In the case of United States v. Leahey (434 F.2d 7), the court held that the privilege cannot be maintained with respect to corporate records, and the same principle applies to personal records. As stated in Wilson v. United States (221 U.S. 361), "The only question is whether as against the corporation the books were lawfully required in the administration of justice. When the appellant became president of the corporation and as such held and used its books for the transaction of its business committed to his charge, he was at all times subject to its direction, and the books continuously remained under its control."

In the case at hand, the government appeals from an order granting a motion to suppress evidence obtained in violation of Internal Revenue Service guidelines. The district court held that the Special Agent failed to advise the taxpayer concerning the possible criminal nature of the investigation and that the omissions were not so serious as to compel suppression. However, the court's finding that the Agent failed to give the criminal warning at the morning meeting was not clearly erroneous, and the government's argument that the omission was not a substantive violation of the IRS regulations is unpersuasive.

The court held that the exclusion of the evidence gathered at the morning meeting was warranted, and the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine should apply to suppress evidence acquired in subsequent meetings. The court also found that the evidence derived from the meetings between the IRS Special Agents and Jobin at the afternoon meeting on May 2 and on subsequent occasions should not be suppressed, citing the principles outlined in United States v. Maciel (351 F.Supp. 817) and United States v. Bayer (331 U.S. 532).

In conclusion, the court's decision is guided by the principles outlined in United States v. Leahey and Wilson v. United States, emphasizing the importance of uniform conduct on the part of IRS Agents and vindication of the taxpayer's right to rely on the published statements of the IRS. The court's holding is consistent with the concept of personal privilege, which is circumscribed by the requirement that individuals subject to government investigation be advised of their rights and provided with an opportunity to consult with counsel.

gold_text: The final question raised by appellant government is whether corporate records should be excluded as a sanction for non-compliance with the warning regulations. Some of the records obtained in the morning meeting were apparently those of Embassy Homes, Inc., the incorporated portion of Jobin’s business. The warning regulations themselves are phrased in terms of a natural person, and are not designed to highlight any privilege possessed by a corporation. See United States v. Sourapas, supra, 515 F.2d at 299. More significantly, it is firmly established that the corporation has no Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and no corporate officer can prevent the disclosure of corporate records which may personally incriminate him. Wilson v. United States, 221 U.S. 361, 31 S.Ct. 538, 55 L.Ed. 771 (1911); see Bellis v. United States, 417 U.S. 85, 94 S.Ct. 2179, 40 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974). Thus, the IRS could have obtained the corporate records through enforcement, 26 U.S.C. § 7604, of the summonses issued to Jobin if he had asserted his rights.
