The case at hand presents two questions: (1) whether the United States' lien claim for penalties on unpaid federal taxes is valid despite the fact that notice of the lien was not filed until after the filing of the petition in bankruptcy; and (2) whether a claim of the United States for penalties on unpaid taxes, upon which claim a lien arose prior to bankruptcy, is barred by Section 57, sub. j of the Bankruptcy Act.

With respect to the first question, the Supreme Court has interpreted Section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code as limiting the class of persons who take priority over the unrecorded tax liens of the United States to judgment creditors (or purchasers, mortgagees, or pledgees) in the conventional and ordinary sense of the words (United States v. Gilbert Associates, 345 U.S. 361, 73 S.Ct. 701, 97 L.Ed. 1071). In United States v. England, 226 F.2d 205, this court held that a trustee in bankruptcy could not claim the status of judgment creditor under Section 6323. Other courts have reached the same result (In re Fidelity Tube Corporation, 278 F.2d 776; Brust v. Sturr, 237 F.2d 135).

Turning to the second question, Section 57, sub. j of the Bankruptcy Act bars debts owing to the United States as a penalty or forfeiture, except for the amount of pecuniary loss sustained and reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby (11 U.S.C.A. § 93). However, the United States contends that Section 57, sub. j does not apply when the penalties are covered by a valid and existing lien at the time of bankruptcy (Hiscock v. Varick Bank, 100 F.2d 979; State of California v. Moore, 88 F.2d 564). In New York v. Jersawit, 263 U.S. 493, 44 S.Ct. 167, 68 L.Ed. 405, a similar issue arose, and the Supreme Court held that a simple claim for priority unsupported by a lien does not come within the scope of Section 57, sub. j.

In conclusion, the United States' lien claim for penalties on unpaid federal taxes is valid despite the lack of notice of the lien prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy
