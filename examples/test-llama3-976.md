The court's analysis of fraudulent joinder is guided by principles set forth in cases such as Marcus v. Sherman International Corporation, 147 F.3d 1325 (1998), and Triggs v. John Crump Toyota, Inc., 31 F.3d 1092 (1994). In evaluating whether the Individual Defendants were fraudulently joined, the court must consider whether there is any possibility that the state law might impose liability on a resident defendant under the circumstances alleged in the complaint. In this case, the complaint alleges a continuous tort theory, which could potentially impose liability on the Individual Defendants for their actions.

The defendants' argument that the Individual Defendants were not fraudulently joined relies heavily on their interpretation of the complaint, which suggests that the alleged wrongdoing occurred solely between 1952 and 1982. However, the court finds that this interpretation is too narrow and ignores the allegations of ongoing contamination and concealment of information.

In light of the court's finding that there is at least a possibility that the Individual Defendants could be held liable under state law, the court must remand the case to the state court. The court also denies the plaintiffs' request for attorney's fees, as the removal was objectively reasonable.

In conclusion, the court finds that the Individual Defendants were not fraudulently joined and that the case must be remanded
