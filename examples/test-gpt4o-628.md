**Generation:**

In determining Dahl’s liability as a “seller” under section 12(1), we refer to the established precedent that participation in the events leading up to a transaction does not suffice to classify one as a seller. In Pharo v. Smith, 621 F.2d 656, 667 (5th Cir. 1980), and reiterated in Hill York Corp. v. American International Franchises, Inc., 448 F.2d 680, 692-93 (5th Cir. 1971), the test focuses on whether the individual’s participation was a substantial factor causing the transaction. Similarly, in Croy v. Campbell, 624 F.2d 709 (5th Cir. 1980), an attorney merely advising on tax consequences was not deemed a seller.

Applying the substantial factor test, we find Dahl’s enthusiastic endorsement and solicitation significantly influenced the plaintiffs’ decisions to purchase the securities (487 F.2d 617, 624 F.2d 709). Dahl’s actions, including helping plaintiffs complete investment contracts and promoting the investments based on his research, were pivotal (650 F.2d 1349). Thus, Dahl is liable under section 12(1), fulfilling the role of a seller as defined by Hill York Corp. Moreover, defenses like estoppel and in pari delicto, per Eichler v. Berner, 472 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 2622, cannot be applied as Dahl’s participation, though substantial, lacked the culpability required to invoke these doctrines (448 F.2d 680).

gold_text: Notwithstanding our conclusion that Dahl meets the substantial factor test, we decline to hold that he is a “seller” for the purposes of section 12(1). The substantial factor test was formulated and has been applied under facts which differ substantially from the facts of this case. In every case we have found employing this test (or its substantial equivalent), the person sought to be held liable as a “seller” received or hoped to receive some financial benefit from his efforts. See, e.g., Junker v. Crory, 650 F.2d 1349 (5th Cir.1981) (corporate attorney acting in capacity as agent of seller); Croy v. Campbell, 624 F.2d 709 (5th Cir.1980) (attorney-accountant who was paid for investment advice); Lewis v. Walston & Co., 487 F.2d 617 (5th Cir.1973) (investment broker); Hill York Corp., 448 F.2d 680 (compensated agents of the issuer). We believe that had this circuit previously been confronted with a promot er of unregistered securities whose efforts were intended to benefit neither the seller nor himself, we would have created a different test. That test would have incorporated a threshold requirement that the promoter be motivated by a desire to confer a direct or indirect benefit on someone other than the person he has advised to purchase. We believe that a rule imposing liability (without fault or knowledge) on friends and family members who give one another gratuitous advice on investment matters unreasonably interferes with well-established patterns of social discourse. Absent express direction by Congress, we decline to impose liability for mere gregariousness.
