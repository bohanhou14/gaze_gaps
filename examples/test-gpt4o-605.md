The doctrine of fraudulent concealment may toll the statute of limitations where a defendant's conduct causes the plaintiff to relax vigilance or deviate from the right of inquiry (449 F.3d 502). Under Pennsylvania law, fraudulent concealment must involve an affirmative and independent act of concealment that misleads the plaintiff (950 F.2d 919). Mere mistake or lack of knowledge is insufficient; there must be intentional or unintentional misleading actions (757 F.2d 548).

In this case, Plaintiff alleges that Reassure America engaged in fraudulent concealment by providing misleading information about the reason for Mr. Bariski’s policy termination. Specifically, Plaintiff contends that Defendant's assurance that timely payment would reinstate the policy could have caused Mr. Bariski and herself to deviate from pursuing further inquiry. However, the evidence does not indicate that Defendant’s conduct would legally constitute fraudulent concealment as delineated in 950 F.2d 919 ("[T]he statute of limitations will commence as soon as a plaintiff has actual or constructive knowledge of at least some form of significant harm and of a factual cause linked to another’s conduct").

In light of these legal principles, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not met the burden to show fraudulent concealment to toll the statute of limitations. Plaintiff knew about the policy termination by early 2006, thus was obligated to investigate potential claims at that time. Therefore, Plaintiffs cause of action for bad faith is time-barred and not salvaged by the fraud claims under the outlined legal standards.

gold_text: The doctrine of fraudulent concealment serves to toll the statute of limitation where a defendant “causes the plaintiff to relax vigilance or deviate from the right of inquiry” concerning the cause of an injury. Mest v. Cabot Corp., 449 F.3d 502, 516 (3d Cir.2006) (quoting Ciccarelli v. Carey Canadian Mines, Ltd., 757 F.2d 548, 556 (3d Cir.1985)). For example, a physician’s statement which “lull[s] a patient into a false sense of security” can in certain circumstances constitute fraudulent concealment. Bohus v. Beloff, 950 F.2d 919, 926 (3d Cir.1991) (citations omitted) (finding fraudulent concealment where a physician told his patient that her post-surgery pain was a normal part of the healing process). Plaintiff bears the burden of proving the applicability of the doctrine by “clear, precise, and convincing evidence.” Fine, 870 A.2d at 860 (citing Molineux v. Reed, 516 Pa. 398, 532 A.2d 792, 794 (1987)). The doctrine of fraudulent concealment only applies where the defendant has deceived the plaintiff, intentionally or unintentionally, such that the plaintiff is unaware of the injury and its cause. Fine, 870 A.2d at 860-61; see also Mest, 449 F.3d at 517 (requiring plaintiff to demonstrate an act of concealment on the part of the defendant that “would divert or mislead the plaintiff from discovering the injury”).
