The Supreme Court has construed Rule 60(b)(6) as providing relief only under extraordinary circumstances that excuse a party's failure to follow ordinary paths of appeal. Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, 69 S.Ct. 384, 93 L.Ed. 266 (1949) (referenced in 889 F.2d 242). This is not a mechanism for reconsidering deliberate litigation choices as established in Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 71 S.Ct. 209, 95 L.Ed. 207 (1950) (889 F.2d 242).

Additionally, what constitutes "reasonable time" under Rule 60(b) depends on the specific facts of each case. Washington v. Penwell, 700 F.2d 570, 572-73 (9th Cir. 1983) (762 F.2d 720). Leniency is warranted in instances where good reasons for delay exist, as noted in McKinney v. Boyle, 447 F.2d 1091, 1093 (9th Cir. 1971) (762 F.2d 720).

In this case, similar to the facts analyzed in Penwell and McKinney, Alpine failed to appeal due to a misperception of the government’s objections' impact, a reason that might not constitute extraordinary circumstances, thereby muddying the district court's discretion (921 F.2d 393). Given these precedents, the district court's grant of Alpine's motion under Rule 60(b)(6) could be seen as an abuse of discretion given the lack of extraordinary circumstances or a valid reason for prolonged inaction (921 F.2d 393; 762 F.2d 720).

Thus, based on precedents like Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Dunnahoo, 637 F.2d 1338, 1341 (9th Cir. 1981) and Martella v. Marine Cooks & Stewards Union, 448 F.2d 729, 730 (9th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 974, 92 S.Ct. 1191, 31 L.Ed.2d 248 (1972) (889 F.2d 242), the extraordinary circumstances required for Rule 60(b)(6) relief appear unmet (889 F.2d 242).

gold_text: Our review of cases in this and other circuits illustrates that the courts of appeal have heeded the Supreme Court’s admonitions regarding Rule 60(b)(6); such relief is available only where extraordinary circumstances prevented a litigant from seeking earlier, more timely relief. Although the timeliness of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion “depends on the facts of each ease,” relief may not be had where “the party seeking reconsideration has ignored normal legal recourses.” In re Pacific Far East Lines, Inc., 889 F.2d 242, 249, 250 (9th Cir.1989) (holding relief appropriate where new legislation undermined the soundness of the judgment). See also United States v. Holtzman, 762 F.2d 720 (9th Cir.1985) (five year delay permissible where litigant reasonably interpreted an injunction to authorize litigant’s conduct and timely relief was sought upon receipt of notice to the contrary); Rivera v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., 921 F.2d 393 (1st Cir.1990) (twenty-three day delay permitted because party not properly notified of pending motion); J.D. Pharmaceutical Distrib., Inc. v. Save-On Drugs & Cosmetics Corp., 893 F.2d 1201, 1207 (11th Cir.1990) (relief from judgment granted because party never served with requests for admissions or motion for summary judgment). These cases demonstrate that Rule 60(b)(6) relief normally will not be granted unless the moving party is able to show both injury and that circumstances beyond its control prevented timely action to protect its interests.
