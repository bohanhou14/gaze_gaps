In evaluating the admissibility of Charles King's testimony under Daubert and Federal Rule of Evidence 702, the court must ensure the relevance and reliability of the expert's methodology and conclusions (Rule 702, Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999)). King’s qualifications as an economist and expert in pharmaceutical marketing provide him with the necessary background to offer informed opinions on the defendants' marketing practices and their impact on off-label Neurontin prescriptions.

First, regarding the reliability of King's methodology, it is pertinent to note that criticisms on the empirical validity or ascertainability of error rates do not automatically exclude expert testimony if the methodology is generally accepted and appropriate for the issues at hand. For instance, in reference case 470 F.3d 1115, the court noted that “inherent methodological limitations” in studies do not necessarily preclude their admissibility under Daubert as long as the overall approach is scientifically sound (Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co., 130 F.3d 1287, 1297 (8th Cir.1997)).

Similarly, the defendants’ argument that King’s expert opinions are inadmissible because he extrapolated the effects of marketing to non-targeted physicians involves a challenge to the weight rather than the admissibility of the evidence (Reference case 588 F.3d 908). In that case, disputes over the methodologies and scopes of experts’ analyses did not render the methodologies unreliable or inadmissible. Such issues are best addressed through cross-examination rather than outright exclusion.

Therefore, the court finds that Charles King meets the standards set forth under Daubert and Rule 702 for expert testimony. The defendants’ motion to exclude his testimony is denied, allowing King to present his findings on the impact of Pfizer’s marketing efforts on the prescribing behaviors for Neurontin.

gold_text: The defendants, broadly speaking, argue that King’s testimony is irrelevant and is not supported by proper methodology. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, a district court’s task in assessing expert evidence is to determine whether the evidence “ ‘both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.’ ” Ky. Speedway, LLC v. Nat’l Ass’n of Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc., 588 F.3d 908, 915 (6th Cir.2009) (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786). Generally, “[t]he district court must consider ‘whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid.’ ” Id. (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. 2786). But when deciding whether to admit expert testimony that relates to a social science, “the factors suggested in Daubert are not to be applied mechanically; rather, district courts are accorded wide latitude in determining the reliability of expert testimony.” United States v. LeBlanc, 45 Fed.Appx. 393, 399 (6th Cir.2002); see also United States v. Simmons, 470 F.3d 1115, 1123 (5th Cir.2006) (noting courts’ discretion in admitting testimony regarding “areas of expertise, such as the ‘social sciences in which the research, theories and opinions cannot have the exactness of hard science methodologies’ ”). The purpose of the court’s gatekeeping role “is to make certain that an expert, whether basing testimony upon professional studies or personal experience, employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.” Kumho, 526 U.S. at 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167.
