In the case of 123 F.3d 599, the court held that the Illinois Brick doctrine does not apply to a vertical conspiracy with no allegations of pass-on. The court ruled that the doctrine is only applicable to cases where there are multiple layers of distribution and the plaintiff is an indirect purchaser. In this case, the plaintiff is a direct purchaser and is not an indirect purchaser.

In the case of 497 U.S. 199, the court held that the Illinois Brick doctrine does not apply to a case where the plaintiff is a direct purchaser and the defendant is a conspiring party in the chain of distribution. The court ruled that the doctrine is only applicable to cases where there are multiple layers of distribution and the plaintiff is an indirect purchaser.

The court in this case is applying the same reasoning as in the previous cases. The plaintiff is a direct purchaser and is not an indirect purchaser. Therefore, the Illinois Brick doctrine does not apply to this case.

The court is also applying the reasoning of other cases, such as Austin v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 903 F.2d 1885 (11th Cir.1990), which held that the Illinois Brick doctrine does not apply to a case where the plaintiff is a direct purchaser and the defendant is a conspiring party in the chain of distribution.

In conclusion, the court's decision is consistent with the reasoning of previous cases and applies the same principles to this case. The Illinois Brick doctrine does not apply to a vertical conspiracy with no allegations of pass-on, and the plaintiff is a direct purchaser and is not an indirect purchaser.

gold_text: Moreover, In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation, 123 F.3d 599 (7th Cir.1997), and Kansas v. Utili-Corp United, Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 110 S.Ct. 2807, 111 L.Ed.2d 169 (1990), do not bear on our decision. First, In re Brand Name is distinguishable for the same reasons as Austin and In re Beef. Second, that the Supreme Court refused to carve out another exception to the Illinois Brick doctrine in UtiliCorp — a case where the facts seemed ripe for an exception — is unremarkable. Plaintiffs here, unlike in Utili- Corp, are not looking for an exception to Illinois Brick based on the facts of a particular market; Illinois Brick simply does not apply to this kind of conspiracy.
