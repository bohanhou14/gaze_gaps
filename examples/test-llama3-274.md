The court's decision in this case is a complex and nuanced one, involving the intersection of antidumping duty law and the treatment of antidumping deposits in export price calculations. The court's reasoning is guided by the statutory language and the agency's reasonable interpretation of it.

In the case of Marine Gold's request for individual examination as a voluntary respondent, the court remands the matter for reconsideration, citing the court's previous decision in Grobest, which held that Commerce must show that the burden of reviewing a voluntary respondent would exceed that presented in the typical antidumping review. The court finds that Commerce's denial of Marine Gold's request was based on a reasonable interpretation of the statute, but that the agency failed to demonstrate that the burden of reviewing Marine Gold would be unduly burdensome.

In the case of AHSTAC's challenge to Commerce's denial of an export price adjustment for the payment of antidumping deposits, the court sustains Commerce's decision, finding that the agency's interpretation of the statute is reasonable. The court explains that Commerce's practice of not reducing export price by the amount of antidumping deposits paid on subject entries is based on the agency's understanding of the statute, which is to ensure a fair comparison between export price and normal value. The court notes that the antidumping deposit is a refundable security deposit to ensure that importers do not purchase merchandise at prices below fair value, and that the deposit is not a cost or charge that should be deducted from export price.

The court's decision is guided by the statutory language and the agency's reasonable interpretation of it, as set forth in the cases of 68 F.3d 1347 and 713 F.2d 1568. The court's ruling on Marine Gold's request for individual examination is consistent with the court's previous decision in Grobest, and the court's ruling on AHSTAC's challenge to Commerce's denial of an export price adjustment is consistent with the agency's reasonable interpretation of the statute.

United States, 713 F.2d 1568, 1571-72 (Fed.Cir.1983) (explaining that Commerce must adjust both normal value and export price "in an attempt to reconstruct the price at a specific, 'common' point in the chain of commerce, so that the-value can be fairly compared on an equivalent basis”). For example, the export price is reduced by the cost of delivering the subject merchandise from the exporting country to the United States, 19 U.S.C, § 1677a(c)(2)(A), because this additional cost is not a part of normal value and so distorts the comparison.
