In reviewing the district court's summary judgment, we employ a de novo standard similar to the approach laid out in Bodenheimer v. PPG Industries, Inc., 5 F.3d 955, 956 (5th Cir.1993) and Mozeke v. Int'l. Paper Co., 856 F.2d 722, 724 (5th Cir.1988). The district court’s denial of a permanent injunction, in contrast, will be reviewed for an abuse of discretion as established in Peaches Entertainment Corp. v. Entertainment Repertoire Assocs., Inc., 62 F.3d 690, 693 (5th Cir.1995).

The Louisiana legislature's retroactive imposition of Act 188 is challenged based on the principles elaborated in Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 475 U.S. 211, 224-25, 106 S.Ct. 1018, 1026 (1986). Connolly specifies the need to assess economic impact, interference with reasonable expectations, and the nature of governmental action. While Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498, 541-42, 118 S.Ct. 2131 (1998) emphasizes the retroactive impact and the imposition of unforeseen liabilities, distinguishing Connolly’s contextually-mitigative provisions, the present case aligns more with Eastern Enterprises in the long period of retroactivity and substantial economic burden faced by the insurers.

The district court’s rationale for upholding Act 188 ignored the lack of proportionality and the inability of the insurers to mitigate its financial liability, an oversight evident in Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Dawson, 4 F.3d 1303, 1306 (5th Cir.1993). Given these points, we conclude that Act 188 unconstitutionally takes the plaintiffs’ property without just compensation. The district court’s judgment is REVERSED and REMANDED for the entry of appropriate injunctive relief.

REVERSED and REMANDED.
