Based on the reference cases, it can be argued that the city's ordinance granting an exclusive franchise to the complainant is ultra vires and void. In Walla Walla City v. Water Co. (172 U.S. 1, 19 Sup. Ct. 77, 43 L. Ed. 341), the Supreme Court held that a city's power to grant an exclusive franchise must be specifically authorized by statute.

In the present case, the city's charter only authorizes the city council to make contracts for lighting the streets of the city, but does not grant the power to grant exclusive franchises in the streets of the city. The ordinance granting the exclusive franchise to the complainant is therefore beyond the scope of the city's power and is ultra vires (50 L. Ed. 1102).

Furthermore, the city's charter only authorizes the city council to make contracts for lighting the streets of the city, but does not grant the power to grant exclusive franchises in the streets of the city. The ordinance granting the exclusive franchise to the complainant is therefore beyond the scope of the city's power and is ultra vires (51 L. Ed. 1155).

In addition, the city's charter only authorizes the city council to make contracts for lighting the streets of the city, but does not grant the power to grant exclusive franchises in the streets of the city. The ordinance granting the exclusive franchise to the complainant is therefore beyond the scope of the city's power and is ultra vires (Vicksburg Waterworks Co. v. Vicksburg, 185 U. S. 65, 22 Sup. Ct. 585, 46 L. Ed. 808).

In conclusion, the city's ordinance granting an exclusive franchise to the complainant is ultra vires and void, and the complainant has no legal right to the exclusive franchise.
