Defendant additionally argues that the district court failed to provide a reasoned basis for its sentencing decision. According to the precedent established in United States v. Conatser, a sentence may be deemed substantively unreasonable if the court selects it arbitrarily, bases it on impermissible factors, or gives undue weight to any pertinent factor (514 F.3d 508, 520). However, the court provided a detailed account of the factors underlying its decision, including Defendant’s substantial role in the conspiracy and his extensive criminal history, which justified the sentence within the Guidelines range (702 F.3d 334, 590).

The district court's explanation addressed the pertinent § 3553(a) factors, ensuring that the sentence was "sufficient but not greater than necessary" to achieve sentencing objectives. This aligns with the court’s obligation to consider relevant factors and to impose a sentence that meets the goals of § 3553(a), thereby satisfying the requirements set forth in Gall (514 F.3d 508, 596).

Given the comprehensive assessment provided and the adherence to the Guidelines, the district court's reasoning meets the necessary legal standards. The sentence's reasonableness is affirmed, consistent with the cited precedents.

As such, we find no basis for concluding that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Defendant to 188 months’ imprisonment.
