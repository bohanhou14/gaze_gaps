Glover's arguments against Agent Zimmer's expert testimony are without merit. As established in United States v. DeClue, 899 F.2d 1465, 1473 (6th Cir.1990), an expert can offer an opinion that aids the jury in determining a fact in issue without usurping its function. Agent Zimmer did not give a legal conclusion on Glover's guilt but provided technical information on vehicle manufacturing, a permissible expert opinion (128 F.3d 376).

Moreover, the court’s cautionary instruction mitigated any potential prejudice, echoing the principle from United States v. Harris, 192 F.3d 580, 588 (6th Cir.1999) that an abuse of discretion in admitting expert testimony does not warrant reversal unless substantial rights are affected. Here, substantial rights were not affected because the jury was explicitly instructed to assess the expert's testimony independently (207 F.3d 84).

In conclusion, we find no abuse of discretion in admitting Agent Zimmer’s testimony. Accordingly, Glover's conviction is AFFIRMED, consistent with the court’s rulings in prior cases (946 F.2d 615; 68 F.3d 101).

gold_text: Agent Zimmer’s testimony did not usurp the function of the jury; rather, his testimony was permissible as an expert opinion to help the jury determine a fact in issue. Cf. United States v. Monus, 128 F.3d 376, 386 (6th Cir.1997) (holding that expert testimony of IRS agent regarding tax liability did not usurp the function of the jury as agent did not give her opinion about the guilt of the defendant). Other courts have held that the government may use expert testimony to prove the interstate nexus element of a weapons charge brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 922. See, e.g., United States v. Corey, 207 F.3d 84, 88-89 (1st Cir.2000) (noting that an expert may testify that a weapon was manufactured in one state and sold in another, and thus to state their opinion as to that issue); United States v. Privett, 68 F.3d 101, 104 (5th Cir.1995) (holding that “[pjroof of the interstate nexus to the firearm may be based upon expert testimony”), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1226, 116 S.Ct. 1862, 134 L.Ed.2d 960 (1996); United States v. Dunn, 946 F.2d 615, 618 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that an expert may testify regarding the place of manufacture of a weapon in order to establish whether the weapon traveled in interstate commerce); United States v. Ware, 914 F.2d at 1002-03 (7th Cir.1990) (holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing expert to testify as to the place of manufacture of weapon, since his testimony could have been useful to the jury to determine whether the weapon had traveled in interstate commerce and court gave a limiting instruction). The reasoning of those courts is applicable here. The ultimate decision as to whether the victim’s car had traveled in interstate or foreign commerce remained within the province of the jury. The expert was only drawing on common sense when he gave his opinion as to the ultimate issue, and the jury was informed that it could accept or reject the expert’s testimony, as it could with any other witness.
