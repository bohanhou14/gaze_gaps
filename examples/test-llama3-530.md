ORDER
The above-referenced case was referred to Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B), on February 16, 1996. On February 7, 1997, Magistrate Judge Scott filed a Report and Recommendation recommending that the government's motion for partial summary judgment be granted and that the defendant's cross-motion to dismiss and for partial summary judgment be denied.

As previously stated, the defendant failed to file objections to the Report and Recommendation within the specified time. Therefore, the Court adopts the Report and Recommendation as its own.

The Court finds that the presentation of a check for payment under the circumstances in this case constitutes a "claim" for the purposes of the False Claims Act, as stated in United States v. McLeod, 721 F.2d 282 (9th Cir.1983), and United States v. Neifert-White, 390 U.S. 228, 88 S.Ct. 959, 19 L.Ed.2d 1061 (1968).

Furthermore, the Court finds that the government's complaint is pled with sufficient particularity pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), as stated in Shields v. Citytrust Bancorp, 25 F.3d 1124, 1128 (2nd Cir.1994), and Acito v. IMCERA Group, Inc., 47 F.3d 47, 52 (2nd Cir.1995).

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, that:

1. The government's motion for partial summary judgment (Docket # 14) is GRANTED; and;
2. The defendant's cross-motion to dismiss and for partial summary judgment (Docket # 19) is DENIED.

Pursuant to 28 USC § 636(b)(1), it is hereby ordered that this ORDER be filed with the Clerk of the Court and that the Clerk shall send a copy of the ORDER to all parties.

ANY OBJECTIONS to this ORDER must be filed with the Clerk of this Court within ten (10) days after receipt of a copy of this ORDER in accordance with 28 USC § 636(b)(1), Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b) and WDNY Local Rule 72(a)(3).
