Mid South argues that Wyant posed a direct threat to the health or safety of himself and others at the workplace, making him unqualified under the ADA. The ADA allows for qualification standards that include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat, defined as a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be mitigated by reasonable accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 12113(b). Reference case 101 F.3d 1090 supports this position, stating that an individual is not qualified if they impose a safety risk that cannot be eliminated.

Mid South claims that Wyant's medical conditions, particularly his lung impairment and the potential for severe coughing spells, created substantial safety concerns. This argument finds support in reference case 920 F.2d 311, where the court noted that an individual is not qualified for a job if there is a genuine substantial risk either to themselves or others, and the employer cannot modify the job to eliminate that risk. The safety of the work environment, involving complex machinery and potential exposure to hazardous materials, further substantiates this argument.

However, the EEOC argues that Wyant's conditions did not pose a direct threat that could not be accommodated. They maintain that with reasonable accommodations, such as the use of an inhaler, Wyant could safely perform his job functions. This creates a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether Wyant posed a direct threat, which must be resolved by the trier of fact.

Thus, the Motion for Summary Judgment on the basis of the direct threat defense is DENIED.
