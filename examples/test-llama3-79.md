In the case at hand, the plaintiff, Jerry R. Wilson, a school teacher, is suing the Pleasant Hill School District, the Board of Education, and the superintendent for allegedly violating his constitutionally-protected rights to free speech and association, as well as his right to due process of law. The plaintiff claims that his contract was not renewed due to his activities in teacher associations, rather than the reasons given by the Board.

In Monroe v. Pape (1961), the Supreme Court held that a suit lies against individual defendants, even if they are acting in their official capacities, as long as the injury is not caused by their official duties. However, in this case, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that his contract was not renewed due to his activities in teacher associations. The evidence presented by the defendants shows that the decision not to rehire the plaintiff was based on his performance as a teacher and his personal conduct, rather than his association activities.

Furthermore, the case of Monroe v. Pape does not apply to this case, as the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the injury was not caused by the official duties of the defendants. In fact, the evidence presented by the defendants shows that they were acting in their official capacities and that their decision not to rehire the plaintiff was based on their official duties.

In conclusion, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that his contract was not renewed due to his activities in teacher associations, and the case of Monroe v. Pape does not apply to this case. Therefore, the plaintiff's claim that his contract was not renewed due to his activities in teacher associations is without merit.

gold_text: . Prior to the trial of this action, in their motion to dismiss, defendants raised the following contentions, inter alia: that the National Education Association lacked standing to bring this action; that Pleasant Hill School District R-III is not a “person” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and that the members of the Board of Education are not amenable to suit either in their individual or official capacities. As to these .contentions, see: Board of Trustees of Arkansas A & M College v. Davis, 396 F.2d 730, 734 (8th Cir. 1968) ; Smith v. Board of Education of Morrilton School District No. 32, 365 F.2d 770, 776-778 (8th Cir. 1966) ; and Harkless v. Sweeny Independent School District, 427 F.2d 319 (5th Cir. 1970), reversing 300 F.Supp. 794 (S.D.Tex. 1969). However, in light of the ultimate findings of this Court, a determination of defendants’ motion is not necessary.
