In determining whether the Baird was a "dead" ship, we draw from the principle established in North Pacific Steamship Co. v. Hall Bros. Co., 249 U.S. 119, 39 S.Ct. 221, indicating that a vessel being prepared for maritime commerce should still be considered within admiralty jurisdiction. Moreover, the case of New Bedford Dry Dock Co. v. Purdy, 258 U.S. 96, 42 S.Ct. 243, provides a precedent that new construction should not be considered nonmaritime if the intended use is for navigation and commerce. Thus, the Baird's preparation for a sealing voyage in 1950 and 1951 places her within maritime jurisdiction as established in 181 F.2d 356.

Regarding the question of authority to bind the vessel to a maritime lien, the principles from Dampskibsselskabet Dannebrog v. Signal Oil & Gas Co., 310 U.S. 268, 60 S.Ct. 937, hold that unless there is explicit denial of authority, presumptive authority stands. The district court erred in placing the burden on the libellant without sufficient evidence of an explicit agreement (100 F.2d 871). The case of Morse Drydock & Repair Co. v. Steamship Northern Star, 271 U.S. 552, emphasized that a repair lien takes precedence unless the mortgage is endorsed on the vessel's documents, which was not shown here.

Therefore, the libellant is entitled to a maritime lien for the services rendered in 1950 and 1951. The judgment of the district court will be reversed for lack of sufficient legal basis to deny admiralty jurisdiction and the maritime lien.
