Plaintiff Agricultural contends that the GRDA waived its sovereign immunity by engaging in certain actions. In McLaughlin v. Schacht, 215 F.3d 1168, the court held that constructive waiver occurs when a state voluntarily invokes the jurisdiction of the federal court, a situation similarly highlighted in the review of Sutton. In McLaughlin, the defendants' decision to litigate the case on its merits after removal to federal court was considered an effective waiver of their sovereign immunity [215 F.3d at 1170]. Conversely, in our present case, the invocation of the federal court’s jurisdiction did not stem from removal but originated in federal court under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, distinguishing it from the scenario in McLaughlin.

Furthermore, in Gallagher v. Schacht, 302 F.3d 1200, the Tenth Circuit confirmed that removing a case to federal court constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity only if the state actively litigates the merits of the case post-removal [302 F.3d at 1268-69]. Given that the GRDA did not pursue removal and the case was originally filed in federal court, the criterion for waiver by seeking a federal forum remains unmet.

Thus, following the precedents set by McLaughlin, Sutton, and Gallagher, the GRDA did not voluntarily invoke the federal court’s jurisdiction in a manner that would equate to a waiver of its Eleventh Amendment immunity.

gold_text: A state entity may also waive its sovereign immunity by voluntarily invoking federal court jurisdiction. See McLaughlin v. Bd. of Trustees of State Colls., 215 F.3d 1168, 1170 (10th Cir.2000). Litigating the merits of a claim may serve as a voluntary invocation of federal court jurisdiction sufficient to waive a state entity’s sovereign immunity. See id.; Estes v. Wyo. Dept. of Transp., 302 F.3d 1200, 1205 (10th Cir.2002). Here, the GRDA immediately contested federal court jurisdiction based on its right to Eleventh Amendment immunity. We, therefore, hold that the GRDA has not waived its sovereign immunity in the present case.
