The defendants urge that even if the plaintiff asserts valid constitutional claims, monetary damages are precluded by judicial immunity, as established in *Stump v. Sparkman*, 435 U.S. 349, and that only equitable relief can be sought (see *Wood v. Strickland*, 420 U.S. 308). The *Smith v. Losee* precedent affirms that qualified immunity applies to university officials in good faith actions (*Smith v. Losee*, 485 F.2d 334). 

In *Brown v. Supreme Court of Nevada*, it was underscored that the Supreme Court and its justices are immune from suits for monetary damages under § 1983, an assertion supported by *Pierson v. Ray*, which upheld judicial immunity from damages in civil rights suits (386 U.S. 547). Cases such as *Keenan v. Board of Law Examiners of State of N.C.*, 317 F.Supp. 1350, determined that federal courts may consider constitutional claims denied or unaddressed by state courts. Jurisdiction exists if the constitutional issues were not litigated, as noted in *Martin-Trigona v. Underwood*, 529 F.2d 33, and supported by *Grossgold v. Supreme Court of Illinois*.

While monetary damages are barred by judicial immunity, the plaintiff's eligibility for equitable relief is not precluded (see *United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO v. Bishop*, 598 F.2d 408). Thus, the complaint’s request for injunctive and declaratory relief remains under the purview of the federal court, per precedents in *Younger v. Harris*, 401 U.S. 37, and elaborated in *Newsome v. Dominique*, 455 F.Supp. 1373.

gold_text: There is a minority of cases that hold that judicial immunity applies to injunctive or other equitable relief, as well as money damages. MacKay v. Nesbett, 285 F.Supp. 498 (D.Alaska 1968), aff’d on other grounds 412 F.2d 846 (9th Cir. 1969); Town of Hopkins, S.C. v. Cobb, 466 F.Supp. 1215 (D.S.C.1979). The majority rule is to the contrary, however. Immunity from damages does not ordinarily bar equitable relief as well. Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975); Brown v. Supreme Court of Nevada, supra; Shipp v. Todd, 568 F.2d 133 (9th Cir. 1978); Sparks v. Duval County Ranch Co., Inc., 604 F.2d 976 (5th Cir. 1979); Wiesenfeld v. State of N. Y., 474 F.Supp. 1141 (S.D.N.Y. 1979); Law Students Civil Research Coun., Inc. v. Wadmond, 299 F.Supp. 117 (S.D.N.Y. 1969), aff’d 401 U.S. 154, 91 S.Ct. 720, 27 L.Ed.2d 749 (1971). In fact, it has been held specifically that state judges may be enjoined against the commission of acts that violate civil rights, even though the court as an entity may not be held liable under the Civil Rights Act. Erdmann v. Stevens, 458 F.2d 1205 (2nd Cir. 1972); Brown v. Supreme Court of Nevada, supra.
