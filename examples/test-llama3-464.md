The cases mentioned in the reference articles are relevant to the discussion of international treaties and their interpretation. In the context of the Warsaw Convention, which governs international air transportation, the United States has consistently interpreted Article 24 to mean that passengers cannot assert claims under local law unless the injury results from an "accident" and the "accident" results in physical injury or physical manifestation of injury. (525 U.S. 155)

Similarly, in the context of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the United States has consistently interpreted the provision granting the United Nations immunity from suit, absent an express waiver. (622 F.3d 123) This interpretation is reinforced by the Second Circuit's decision in Brzak v. United Nations, where the court held that the United Nations enjoys absolute immunity from suit unless it has expressly waived its immunity. (597 F.3d 107)

In the present case, the United Nations and MINUSTAH are immune from Plaintiffs' suit due to the absolute grant of immunity under the CPIUN. The fact that the United Nations has failed to provide a dispute resolution mechanism for the claims at issue does not waive its immunity. (560 U.S. 1) The CPIUN's drafting history and the Second Circuit's construction of the treaty confirm that the United Nations is entitled to absolute immunity from suit, absent an express waiver.

In conclusion, the cases mentioned in the reference articles support the conclusion that the United Nations and MINUSTAH are immune from Plaintiffs' suit. The interpretation of international treaties, such as the Warsaw Convention and the CPIUN, is crucial in determining the scope of immunity granted to international organizations.

Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U.S. 155, 168, 119 S.Ct. 662, 142 L.Ed.2d 576 (1999)) (alteration in original); see also Swarna v. Al-Awadi, 622 F.3d 123, 133 (2d Cir.2010) (“[W]hile the interpretation of a treaty is a question of law for the courts, given the nature of the document and the unique relationships it implicates, the ‘Executive Branch’s’ interpretation of a treaty is entitled to great weight.’ ” (quoting Abbott v. Abbott, 560 U.S. 1, 15, 130 S.Ct. 1983, 176 L.Ed.2d 789 (2010))). For the reasons given above, the United States’ interpretation that the CPIUN’s grant of immunity is vitiated only by an express waiver of that immunity by the UN is reasonable. Here, where such an express waiver is absent, the UN and its subsidiary body MINUS-TAH are immune from suit.
