In the case of Sanya v. United States, the defendant appeals from the sentences imposed upon resentencing after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit access device fraud, access device fraud, and aggravated identity theft. The defendant contends that the government presented false and misleading testimony, and that the government breached the plea agreement by introducing evidence and arguing for an amount of loss exceeding that stipulated to in the plea agreement.

The court rejected the defendant's arguments, finding that the government's testimony was not misleading and that the government had the right to advocate for losses in excess of $400,000, as stated in the plea agreement. The court also found that the government's calculation of the loss was reasonable, and that the defendant's sentence was not plainly erroneous.

In reaching its decision, the court relied on the principles set forth in Pearce v. United States, 395 U.S. 711 (1969), which holds that a defendant cannot be subjected to vindictive sentencing. The court also relied on the principles set forth in United States v. Sandoval, 490 U.S. 794 (1989), which holds that a defendant's sentence cannot be increased solely because of a change in the law.

The court also considered the defendant's sentence for the access device fraud and aggravated identity theft convictions, and found that the sentence was reasonable and not plainly erroneous. The court rejected the defendant's Anders challenge to the sentence, finding that the defendant had admitted the factual basis for his plea and that the sentence was within the properly calculated Sentencing Guidelines range.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is consistent with the principles set forth in Pearce v. United States and United States v. Sandoval. The court's rejection of the defendant's arguments is also consistent with the principles set forth in Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959), which holds that a defendant cannot be subjected to a sentence that is based on false or misleading evidence.

gold_text: Sanya’s Anders brief also suggests that the sentence be reviewed to determine whether it suffers from vindictiveness for successfully mounting his first appeal. “Due process of law ... requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 725, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), overruled on other grounds by Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989). ‘When a sentencing court imposes a more severe sentence on remand, the reasons for the court doing so must affirmatively appear.” United States v.
