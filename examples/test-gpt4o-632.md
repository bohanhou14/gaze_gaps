The court's analysis further underscores that the construction Silva urges is contrary to Supreme Court precedent and the precedent from the Tenth Circuit, as detailed in Reference Case 608 F.3d 663. The Supreme Court's clarification in Shepard, which expands the scope of "building or other structure" to include "enclosed spaces," was not considered in Silva's arguments. As noted in United States v. Rivera-Oros, the Tenth Circuit disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's interpretation that the substitution of terms was merely a matter of form (590 F.3d 1123, 1128 n. 4). Moreover, United States v. Cummings clarified that the broader interpretation includes spaces beyond those intended for permanent occupancy, thus supporting the court's decision (531 F.3d 1232, 1235).

In light of these references, and consistent with the residual-clause argument outlined in Reference Case 488 F.3d 844, it is evident that the convictions under the Texas statute meet the generic burglary definition under the ACCA. This comprehensive analysis, therefore, confirms the appropriateness of the ACCA enhancement applied to Chapman's case.

gold_text: Silva’s analysis is brief and appears inconsistent with one aspect of the Texas burglary statute. The statute defines “habitation” to include certain vehicles. Tex. Penal Code § 30.02(1). The statute defines “habitation” more broadly than the word’s common meaning as a structure or building that people live in. The statute criminalizes entry into vehicles as well as buildings or structures. The generic burglary definition in Taylor is not so broad; it criminalizes only entry into “buildings or structures.” Taylor, 495 U.S. at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The Supreme Court and other circuits have stated that generic burglary does not include nonconsensual entry into boats or motor vehicles, even if they are used for habitation. Shepard, 544 U.S. at 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (“The [ACCA] makes burglary a violent felony only if committed in a building or enclosed space (‘generic burglary’), not in a boat or motor vehicle.”) (emphasis added); United States v. Ramon Silva, 608 F.3d 663, 668 (10th Cir.2010); United States v. Grisel, 488 F.3d 844, 848 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (“[T]he term ‘building or structure’ does not encompass objects that could be described loosely as structures but that are either not designed for occupancy or not intended for use in one place. It was this understanding of ‘building or structure’ that the [Supreme] Court adopted. ). Including “vehicle” in the Texas burglary statute appears to make it broader than generic burglary.
