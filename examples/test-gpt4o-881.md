Tri-State's contention that its remedial actions were adequate mirrors the arguments rejected in both 477 U.S. 57 and 970 F.2d 178. In 477 U.S. 57, the Court held that the existence of a general nondiscrimination policy, coupled with inadequate specific measures to address sexual harassment, does not shield an employer from liability. Similarly, in 970 F.2d 178, the ineffectiveness of a company's sexual harassment policy due to lack of awareness among employees and absence of preventive measures also led to the employer's liability. 

In this case, Tri-State's actions were limited to Owings' ineffectual warnings and apologies from Hogland, which failed to stop the escalating harassment. The district court found, consistent with the principles in 477 U.S. 57 and 970 F.2d 178, that merely having a complaint mechanism without effective follow-through does not suffice. Tri-State's failure to establish a robust, proactive policy and to implement meaningful corrective actions substantiates the finding of inadequate remedial measures.

Thus, we affirm the district court's judgment on the harassment and retaliation claims under Title VII, as Tri-State did not meet the required standard of taking prompt and effective remedial action. The district court's findings are supported by the precedent that an employer's liability is not mitigated by procedural inadequacies that fail to protect employees from ongoing harassment.

Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 72, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2408, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986), if Tri-State had had an effective sexual harassment policy in place, the results of this case may have been different. See Kauffman v. Allied Signal, Inc., 970 F.2d 178, 184 (6th Cir.1992) (“if [employer’s] sexual harassment policy had been less flawed, [employer] might not have been liable”), petition for cert. filed, 61 U.S.L.W. 3338 (U.S. Oct. 20, 1992) (No. 92-700). More importantly, if Tri-State had such a policy in place, perhaps Hogland would not have engaged in the offending conduct. As stated in the regulations:
