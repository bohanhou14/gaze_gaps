The core issue in this case revolves around the alleged breach of the agency contract by the plaintiff. Similar to the references in 14 S. Ct. 876 and 38 L. Ed. 814, it is crucial to examine the instructions given regarding the measure of damages recoverable by the non-breaching party. The court in both referenced cases highlighted that if a party in good faith attempted to perform a contract but was hindered by the other party's unauthorized interference, such interference would constitute a breach, justifying the abandonment of the contract and entitling the non-breaching party to recover actual damages incurred due to the interference.

Applying these principles to the current case, it is evident that the defendants John S. Aldehoff & Co. were justified in canceling the contract upon plaintiff's breach. The plaintiff’s action of redirecting reports, cancellations, and endorsements away from the defendants fundamentally undermined their ability to function as general agents, similar to the unjustified interference discussed in 14 S. Ct. 876 and 38 L. Ed. 814. Therefore, the defendants are entitled to damages resulting from this breach.

The lower court's judgment to reject claims for damages while directing a verdict for an overriding commission was partially correct. However, in adhering to the precedents set by the aforementioned cases, the defendants should be entitled to recover actual damages for the business losses caused by plaintiff's breach. Consequently, the court must reconsider the damages awarded in alignment with the guidance from 14 S. Ct. 876 and 38 L. Ed. 814.

Therefore, we remand this case for reassessment of the damages in accordance with the principles established in the referenced cases.
