In the present case, a Bivens action is being considered against the Giles Dalby Correctional Facility, John Doe, Warden, Giles Dalby Facility, Captain Gearhart, Janet Reno, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The plaintiff, Milton Fairweather, claims that he was subjected to excessive force and deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs while in custody at the Giles Dalby Correctional Facility.

In Meyer v. Granados, 510 U.S. 471 (1994), the Supreme Court held that a Bivens action is not available against federal agencies or their employees. The Court reasoned that a damages remedy against federal agencies would be inappropriate and would create a potentially enormous financial burden for the government.

However, in Reuber v. Department of the Army, 156 F.3d 701 (1998), the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a private corporation acting under color of federal law may be subject to a Bivens claim. The court noted that several circuit courts had previously recognized that a Bivens-type claim could be asserted against private corporations that engage in federal action.

In the present case, the plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. As noted in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976), deliberate indifference to serious medical needs may be manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner's needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.

In light of the above, the court finds that the plaintiff's Bivens action is without merit and is therefore dismissed with prejudice.

gold_text: . Whether a private corporation acting under color of federal law may be subject to a Bivens claim is unclear. There is currently a split among the circuits on this issue. In FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994), the Supreme Court of the United States declined to extend Bivens actions to agencies of the federal government. In the wake of the Meyer decision, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that Meyer precluded Bivens suits against private entities acting under color of federal law. This overruled an earlier pre-Meyer D.C. Circuit Court decision allowing such claims. See Kauffman v. Anglo-American School of Sofia, 28 F.3d 1223 (D.C.Cir.1994), overruling Reuber v. United States, 750 F.2d 1039 (D.C.Cir.1984) (held that Bivens encompasses actions against private parties acting under color of federal law, and remanded for a determination of whether the defendant, an operator of a government-owned facility pursuant to a contract with the National Cancer Institute, had so acted). In contrast, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and, most recently, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals have held that Bivens liability extends to private corporations. See Hammons v. Norfolk S. Corp., 156 F.3d 701 (6th Cir.1998); Malesko v. Corr. Serv. Corp., 229 F.3d 374 (2d Cir.2000), cert. granted, Corr. Serv. Corp. v. Malesko,-U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 1224, 149 L.Ed.2d 134 (2001).
