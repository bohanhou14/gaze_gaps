The statutory construction and legislative history clearly support the district court’s conclusion, obviating the need to canvass constitutional questions similarly to the approach used in United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. 363, 369 (1971) and Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62 (1932). As emphasized in Pernell v. Southall Realty, 416 U.S. 363, 365 (1974), adjudicating a dispute under clear statutory directives will avoid unnecessary constitutional determinations. Given this, the court's reliance on the statutory framework in determining the non-retroactive application of the 1978 Act was appropriate, thereby affirming the legitimacy of the original agreement between Roth and the appellees. Moreover, the Court has recognized in reference cases like 434 U.S. 575 the importance of adhering to congressional intent, which in this case shows no support for retroactive application of the 1978 Act. This adherence to statutory interpretation principles rather than unnecessary constitutional exploration aligns with established judicial norms, and thus, Roth's appeals do not hold merit.

V

In conclusion, the existing statutory and judicial standards affirm Roth's agreement as valid. Not only is this position buttressed by clear legislative intent and statutory interpretation, but it averts unwarranted constitutional analysis. As affirmed in numerous precedents, including reference cases such as 434 U.S. 575 and 285 U.S. 22, adherence to legislative intention and clear statutory language provides a steadfast foundation for judicial decisions. Therefore, the judgment of the district court remains affirmed, and Roth's appeals are dismissed as unfounded.

Even the spectre of a constitutional issue concerning the proper application of the “takings clause”, however, is sufficient cause to construe the statute to provide for exclusively prospective relief, particularly in the absence of any clear congressional mandate to the contrary.
