In the context of a trustee in reorganization under Chapter X, personal liability for negligence is a crucial issue. According to Mosser v. Darrow, a trustee is not liable personally for acts of negligence, unless they are willful and deliberate in violation of his duties (552 F.2d 1367). In the case at hand, the plaintiff seeks to hold the trustee personally liable for negligent failure to pay a claim for services furnished the debtor in reorganization. However, the District Judge and the Bankruptcy Judge held that the trustee could not be held personally liable for negligence under the circumstances.

The Bankruptcy Judge's ruling was affirmed by the District Judge, who expressed doubt on the basis of personal knowledge of the trustee's action that any basis for a claim of negligence on the part of the trustee existed (341 U.S. 267). The plaintiff's claim is limited to negligence on the part of the trustee, alleging that he failed to ascertain the debtor's financial ability to comply with the equipment rental agreement, failed to place funds sufficient to cover the post-dated check, and failed to return the leased equipment immediately when he knew the check had been returned for insufficient funds.

However, the facts of the case do not support a finding of negligence on the part of the trustee. The plaintiff was fully aware that the debtor was in reorganization under Chapter X and entered into an oral lease arrangement directly with the officers of the debtor. The plaintiff accepted a post-dated check for the lease payments that had accrued for the months of March and April, and it was clear that both parties assumed that the debtor would realize sufficient funds to meet the check when presented. The possibility that the debtor might not be able to cover the post-dated check was a contingency the plaintiff clearly assumed. As such, the trustee's failure to detect this possibility was not a negligent act, but rather a mere mistake of judgment shared with the plaintiff.

In conclusion, the trustee in this case is not liable personally for negligence, and the plaintiff's claim is without merit. The Bankruptcy Judge's ruling was correct in holding that the trustee was not liable for negligence under the circumstances, and the District Judge's affirmation of that ruling was also correct. The case is an important reminder of the principles of Mosser v. Darrow and the limited circumstances under which a trustee in reorganization may be held personally liable for negligence.

gold_text: But, even if it be assumed that the trustee as such is to be charged with a mistake of judgment in this matter, there is, as the District Court correctly held, no authority for a finding of personal liability here. The general rule is that “[receivers and trustees appointed to conduct business on behalf of an estate in reorganization are by the weight of authority only liable as receivers and trustees. They are not individually liable unless they act outside their authority.” 11 Remington on Bankruptcy § 4507 (1961). (Emphasis added) Unquestionably, the trustee did not act “outside his authority” in continuing the business of the debtor or in accepting the lease of the equipment from the plaintiff as made by the debtor in reorganization. The order of his appointment expressly provided him with such authority. In exercising that authority, the trustee was vested with considerable discretion. When acting within the discretionary bounds of this authority, it is settled that the trustee may not be held liable for any mistake of judgment; that his liability personally is “only for acts determined to be willful and deliberate in violation of his duties” and specifically that he is liable solely “in his official capacity, for acts of negligence.” Sherr v. Winkler, 552 F.2d 1367, 1375 (10th Cir. 1977), relying on Mosser v. Darrow, 341 U.S. 267, 71 S.Ct. 680, 95 L.Ed. 927 (1951). (Emphasis added)
