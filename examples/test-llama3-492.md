The reference cases 632 F.2d 171 and 44 F.3d 136 are relevant to the issue of multi-employer bargaining and the applicability of a collective bargaining agreement to a party that is not a direct employer of the employees covered by the agreement.

In the case of 632 F.2d 171, the court held that a party can be bound by a collective bargaining agreement even if it is not a direct employer of the employees covered by the agreement, if it has delegated authority to the employer to bargain on its behalf. This delegation of authority can be by contract, statute, or other means.

In the case of 44 F.3d 136, the court held that a collective bargaining agreement can be binding on a party even if it is not a direct employer of the employees covered by the agreement, if the party has expressed an unequivocal intention to be bound by the agreement.

In the present case, BCL has delegated authority to NYSA to bargain on its behalf, and has expressed an unequivocal intention to be bound by the Master Contract. Therefore, BCL is bound by the Master Contract and the Containerization Agreement, even though it is not a direct employer of the employees covered by the agreement.

The district court's decision refusing to vacate the arbitration award and confirming the Containerization Agreement is therefore supported by the law, and BCL's appeal is without merit.

gold_text: We look to the employers’ consent to determine whether different employers belong to the same bargaining unit. See NLRB v. New York Typographical Union, No. 6, 632 F.2d 171, 183 (2d Cir.1980). “The Board has consistently held that the essential element warranting the establishment of multi-employer units is clear evidence that the employers unequivocally intend to be bound in collective bargaining by group rather than individual action.” Id. (citations and quotations omitted). “[T]he presumption that a single- employer bargaining unit is appropriate can be overcome only by ‘clear evidence that the employers unequivocally intend to be bound in collective bargaining by group rather than by individual action.’ ” NLRB v. 1115 Nursing Home & Serv. Emp. Union, 44 F.3d 136, 138 (2d Cir.1995) (per curiam), quoting New York Typographical Union, No. 6, 632 F.2d at 183. However, mere agreement to bargain as a group is insufficient; there must be actual bargaining on that basis. See 1115 Nursing Home & Serv. Emp. Union, 44 F.3d at 138. Here, BCL was a member of NYSA from 1979 until its formal resignation on June 20, 1996. By virtue of its membership in the association, BCL granted NYSA authority to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with the ILA. Actual bargaining on a multi-employer basis took place while BCL was a member of NYSA. BCL was bound by the resulting agreements, including the 1996 Master Contract, which included the containerization provisions. Therefore, the district court correctly held that no issue of fact existed regarding BCL’s intent to be bound by the multi-employer Master Contract. Because the Containerization Agreement within that contract was a valid work preservation clause directed at the primary employment relationship, the contract was legal and Judge Keenan correctly held that Section 8(e) does not prohibit confirmation and enforcement of the arbitration award.
