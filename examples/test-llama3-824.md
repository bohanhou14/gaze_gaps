In light of the reference cases, it is clear that the waiver of appellate rights is enforceable if the language of the waiver encompasses the right to appeal on the grounds raised, and the waiver is knowingly and voluntarily made. In United States v. Nguyen, 235 F.3d 1179, the court held that a waiver of appellate rights is valid even if the claims are meritorious. Similarly, in United States v. Rahman, 642 F.3d 1257, the court dismissed the appeal as waived, finding that the defendant's waiver of appellate rights was enforceable.

In the case at hand, the defendant's waiver of appellate rights specifically precluded a challenge to "any aspect of the defendant's sentence — including the manner in which the sentence is determined and any sentencing guideline determinations." This language is broad enough to encompass the grounds raised by the defendant, and the waiver is knowing and voluntary.

The defendant's argument that the requirement that he be sentenced "in accordance with" the plea agreement is ambiguous is unpersuasive. The phrase "in accordance with" is not ambiguous, and the defendant's interpretation would render the waiver meaningless. Furthermore, the plea colloquy and the written plea agreement together eliminated any ambiguity, ensuring that the defendant knew that the judge would be deciding where he fell within the agreed-upon sentencing grid and that he was giving up the right to challenge that determination.

In conclusion, the waiver of appellate rights in this case is enforceable, and the appeal is dismissed as waived. The defendant's attempt to challenge the sentence on grounds of duress, coercion, or prosecutorial duplicity is also unavailing, as the waiver specifically precluded such challenges.

gold_text: Defendant agreed to waive his right to appeal, along with a number of other rights, in exchange for a lower sentence. He received the benefit of that bargain; after subtracting three offense levels for acceptance of responsibility, the district court imposed a below-guidelines sentence. That he “did not realize the strength of his potential appellate claims at the time that he entered into the plea agreement” does not permit- him to invalidate his knowing and voluntary waiver of appellate rights. United States v. Nguyen, 235 F.3d 1179, 1184 (9th Cir.2000), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Rahman, 642 F.3d 1257, 1259 (9th Cir.2011). We will enforce a valid waiver even if the claims that could have been made on appeal absent that waiver appear meritorious, because “[t]he whole point of a waiver ... is the relinquishment of claims regardless of their merit.” Id.
