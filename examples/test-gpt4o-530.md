**Generation:**

The notice provided to the parties here meets the standards as set forth in relevant case law. In *United States v. Walters*, 638 F.2d 947 (6th Cir. 1981), mentioned in 474 U.S. 140, the Sixth Circuit underscored that failure to file timely objections to a magistrate's report waives subsequent review. Similarly, the directions in the magistrate’s report in this case explicitly informed the parties about the obligation to file objections within ten (10) days, and failure to do so results in waiver of the right to appeal, complying with the notice requirements outlined in Small v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs., 892 F.2d 15, 16 (2d Cir.1989) (66 F.3d 566).

Additionally, *Thomas v. Arn*, referenced in 838 F.2d 55, supported providing a clear notice about filing objections to ensure procedural fairness. The magistrate here fully adhered to this precedent by prominently displaying this requisite language, hence there is no issue of notice deficiency.

Based on these confirmations, the recommendation remains that plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment be granted, and the defendant’s cross-motion for dismissal and partial summary judgment be denied.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
