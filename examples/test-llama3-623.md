I have reviewed the provided legal references, including cases 371 U.S. 178 and 445 F.3d 50. Based on the information, I will provide a concise answer to the question.

The main issue in the case is the dismissal of the complaint and the denial of the motion to amend. The court has to consider the standing of the plaintiff, Jan Lightfootlane, to bring the case. The court's previous decision in Lightfootlane v. Maine Dep't of Health and Human Services, No. 06-53-B-W, is relevant here. In that case, the court found that Lightfootlane did not have standing because her allegations did not support a claim that her speech and association rights had been infringed by the State.

The court's decision in 371 U.S. 178 is also relevant. In that case, the court held that a motion to vacate a judgment and a motion to amend a complaint are separate motions that require separate designations under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court further held that a motion under Rule 59(e) suspends the running of the statute of limitations, whereas a motion under Rule 60(b) does not.

In the present case, the court has to consider whether Lightfootlane's amended complaint states a viable claim for relief. The court's decision in 445 F.3d 50 is relevant here. In that case, the court held that a plaintiff must exercise due diligence in amending their complaint and that a trial court may refuse to allow a plaintiff an endless number of trips to the well.

Based on the above, I conclude that the court's decision to dismiss the complaint and deny the motion to amend is reasonable. Lightfootlane's amended complaint does not state a viable claim for relief, and she has not demonstrated a sufficient basis for alleging a constitutional violation. The court's decision is supported by the relevant case law, including 371 U.S. 178 and 445 F.3d 50.

gold_text: “A district court may refuse an amendment to a complaint when the proposed amended complaint would still be subject to dismissal.” MacFarlane v. McKean, No. 92-2390, 1993 WL 349674, at *5, 1993 U.S.App. LEXIS 23463, at *15-16 (1st Cir. Sept. 14, 1993) (regarding the addition of parties under Rule 21, which requires leave of the court). MacFarlane distinguishes Rule 15(a), but only to the extent that Rule 15(a) “permits timely amendment of a complaint without leave of court.” Id. at *5, 1993 U.S.App. LEXIS 23463, at *15. In this case, Rule 15(a) leave is to be freely given, but not if dismissal is warranted. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962) (“In the absence of any apparent or declared reason — such as ... futility of amendment ... — the leave sought should, as the rules require, be ‘freely given.’ ”); Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of Puerto Rico, 445 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2006) (“When a proffered amendment comes too late, would be an exercise in futility, or otherwise would serve no useful purpose, the district court need not allow it.”). Because the Amended Complaint would not change the Court’s decision regarding DHHS’ Motion to Dismiss, the Court denies the motion to amend the complaint as to DHHS.
