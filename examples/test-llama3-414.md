Based on the provided references, I will analyze the case and provide a concise summary. 

The case at hand involves Virginia Blumensaadt, a 42-year-old plaintiff who filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) 20 months prior to her termination. She claims that she was fired in retaliation for filing the charge and that her employer, The Standard Products Company, discriminated against her based on her sex and age.

In her claim, Blumensaadt alleges that the company replaced her with a male employee after her termination. However, the mediator's decision and the state's Unemployment Compensation Board of Review's findings suggest that the company had just cause for terminating her due to her failure to follow the conditions of her reinstatement.

The court also notes that Blumensaadt failed to provide evidence that other non-minority employees were treated differently, nor did she prove any pattern of discrimination in the company's hiring, transferring, or discharge of employees.

In reference to Piva v. Xerox Corp., 654 F.2d 591, 594 (9th Cir. 1981), the court emphasizes that a plaintiff must prove that the defendant's action was taken with a retaliatory intent or motive. Similarly, in Monroe v. Continental Airways, Inc., 676 F.2d 74, 76 (6th Cir. 1982), the court held that a plaintiff must show a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.

Based on the evidence presented, the court finds that Blumensaadt failed to meet her burden of proof and that the company had just cause for terminating her. Therefore, the court grants the company's motion for summary judgment and denies Blumensaadt's claims of discrimination and retaliatory discharge.

In conclusion, the court's decision is in line with the principles established in the reference cases, which emphasize the importance of proving a retaliatory intent or motive and a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. The court's findings support the company's claim that it had just cause for terminating Blumensaadt and that her termination was not discriminatory or retaliatory.
