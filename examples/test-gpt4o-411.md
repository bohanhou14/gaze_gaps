In several prior cases, courts have affirmed that the statutory term "producing" encompasses a wide range of activities associated with the creation and dissemination of child pornography, beyond mere physical production. For example, in United States v. Ortiz, the court noted that although the language of the statute could be broad, judges have often sought to enforce limits to ensure a defensible reading of the statute (526 F.3d 16). Similarly, the comprehensive definition of "producing" in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(3) extends to numerous activities including directing, manufacturing, and issuing. United States v. Fadl emphasized this broad scope, rejecting the notion that a directorial or commercial aim was necessary to constitute production (498 F.3d 862). United States v. Smith underscored that the definition of "producing" does not necessitate a monetary profit motive (459 F.3d 1276).

Moreover, in United States v. Angle, the court held that even the mere act of copying images using equipment that had traveled in interstate commerce could satisfy the statutory requirement (234 F.3d 326). This principle was similarly applied in United States v. Lacy, where the court determined that downloading and storing images on computer equipment met the criteria for production (119 F.3d 742). United States v. Daufenbach further supported this interpretation by acknowledging that the statutory definition of "producing" is inclusive and expansive (182 F.3d 737).

Given this precedent and the established broad interpretation of "producing," Poulin’s production of sexually explicit images using materials that traveled interstate firmly falls within the bounds of 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a). Therefore, we affirm the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial to support his conviction.

gold_text: We find that Congress did not intend so technical a definition of the term “produced” as Poulin would have it. Such a holding comports with Congress’ list of assorted terms defining “producing,” along with our own precedent and that of many of our sister courts. See, e.g., id.; United States v. Ortiz-Graulau, 526 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir.2008) (interpreting § 2251(a) to require only that a visual depiction be made); United States v. Fadl, 498 F.3d 862, 867-68 (8th Cir.2007) (finding Congress intended a nontechnical definition of “producing” and sought to include activities not generally considered to fall within the typical meaning of the term); United States v. Smith, 459 F.3d 1276, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2006) (finding “producing” not unduly technical or ambiguous); United States v. Angle, 234 F.3d 326, 341 (7th Cir.2000) (rejecting restrictive definition and holding that images copied onto computer diskettes are “produced”); Robinson, 137 F.3d at 653-54 (noting evidence of photographs taken with camera and film manufactured outside of state was offered to show “production” using materials shipped in interstate commerce); United States v. Lacy, 119 F.3d 742, 750 (9th Cir.1997) (finding images copied onto computer were created and therefore “produced”). But see United States v. Wilson, 182 F.3d 737, 741-43 (10th Cir.1999) (finding images recorded onto diskettes that traveled interstate insufficient to satisfy “production” requirement).
