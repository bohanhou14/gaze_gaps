In challenging the adequacy of his legal representation, Matlock invokes cases that underscore the constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. In Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, the Supreme Court held that concurrent representation by a single attorney of multiple defendants requires careful scrutiny to avoid conflicts of interest, potentially undermining the defendants' Sixth Amendment rights. Similarly, in 350 F.2d 261, a significant emphasis was placed on the need for conflict-free counsel to preserve the integrity of legal representation.

Matlock's argument hinges on the assertion that his singular counsel’s representation of both him and Burkeen created a conflict of interest. However, in 329 U.S. 173, the court affirmed that remedies provided by state law should be exhausted first before seeking federal relief, emphasizing judicial discretion in preventing conflicts where none are apparent. The district court, after thorough examination, concluded that no such conflict existed between Matlock and Burkeen, negating any claim of prejudiced representation.

Assessing Matlock's claim under these precedents, it becomes apparent that the judicial findings align with established legal standards. No substantive evidence suggested that Mr. Murchison's representation impaired Matlock's defense. The absence of demonstrated prejudice further corroborates that the district court's decision adhered to constitutional requisites, as elucidated in the cited cases.

The constitution does not “require that under all circumstances counsel be forced upon a defendant.” Carter v. People of State of Illinois, 329 U.S. 173, 174-175, 67 S.Ct. 216, 218, 91 L.Ed. 172. The record in this case establishes that the district judge was careful and thorough in explaining to Matlock his right to counsel, and that Matlock on his own volition made the deliberate choice to conduct his own defense. This defendant was not without experience in courtroom proceedings. See, e. g., United States v. Burkeen and United States v. Matlock, 350 F.2d 261 (C.A.6). We hold that Matlock’s right to the effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment has not been violated under the facts and circumstances of this case.
