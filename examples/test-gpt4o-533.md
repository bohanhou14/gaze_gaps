The ambiguity surrounding our jurisdiction is further elucidated by examining similar cases. In *Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. EPA*, 538 F.2d 513 (2d Cir. 1976), the court held that the specificity of section 1369 suggests that not all EPA actions are reviewable in the courts of appeals. The exclusion of section 1313 from the review statute indicates a legislative intent to preclude jurisdiction over total maximum daily loads under that section. Similarly, in *U.S. Steel Corp. v. EPA*, 556 F.2d 822 (7th Cir. 1977), the court emphasized the importance of not interrupting administrative processes without clear statutory authorization, underscoring the principle that judicial review must abide by explicit statutory confines. These precedents reinforce our conclusion that we lack jurisdiction under 33 U.S.C. § 1369(b)(1) to review the EPA's total maximum daily load determination, as section 1313 is conspicuously absent from the enumerated statutes. Accordingly, EPA's motion to dismiss is granted, affirming that any review must proceed in the district court.

We are persuaded that congress and the president decided to leave section 1313 out of the list of statutes in section 1369 for direct appeal from the EPA to the Court of Appeals. Our confidence in this construction is bolstered by the Second Circuit decision, which, though on a distinguishable rationale, reaches the same conclusion. Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Environmental Protection Agency, 538 F.2d 513, 518 (2d Cir.1976); see David Currie, Judicial Review Under Federal Pollution Laws, 62 Iowa L.Rev. 1221, 1244 (1977). Our decision is consistent with that of the Seventh Circuit, that EPA determinations under section 1313(d)(2) “are reviewable in an action in the district court under the judicial review provisions of the APA.” United States Steel Corp. v. Train, 556 F.2d 822, 836 (7th Cir.1977) (emphasis added).
