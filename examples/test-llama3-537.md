In the case of Hawkins v. Ceco Corporation, the plaintiff, Hawkins, alleged that he was illegally discharged because of his race. The district court found that Hawkins proved a prima facie case of racial discrimination by establishing that he was black, qualified for his position, fired by a white, and replaced by a black. However, the court's finding of intentional discrimination was based on an incorrect assumption that Hawkins was replaced by a white employee.

In reviewing the case, it is clear that Hawkins did not meet the fourth requirement of the Prattco formulation of a prima facie case, which requires that the plaintiff be replaced by a non-minority. As stated in Prattco Construction Corporation v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567 (1978), the fourth element of a prima facie case is the "replacement" of the plaintiff by a non-minority. In this case, Hawkins was replaced by a black employee, Daryl Bennet, who was hired shortly after Hawkins was discharged.

Furthermore, the district court's finding of intentional discrimination was based on a flawed analysis of the evidence. As stated in McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), the plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory intent. However, the district court's finding of intentional discrimination was based on a finding that Hawkins was replaced by a white employee, which is not supported by the evidence.

In conclusion, the district court's finding of intentional discrimination in Hawkins v. Ceco Corporation was based on an incorrect assumption that Hawkins was replaced by a white employee. The plaintiff did not meet the fourth requirement of the Prattco formulation of a prima facie case, and the district court's analysis of the evidence was flawed. Therefore, the finding of intentional discrimination was clearly erroneous and should be reversed.

gold_text: None of this evidence adequately supports a claim of racial discrimination or establishes a prima facie case. Substantial statistical proof alone may establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination. James v. Stockham Valves & Fittings Co., 559 F.2d 310, 328-29 (11th Cir.1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1034, 98 S.Ct. 767, 54 L.Ed.2d 781 (1978). But this evidence is not complete nor compelling. Without comparative evidence regarding the number of salaried positions at Ceco, it is difficult to assess the importance of the fact that Huntley was the only black employee on salary for ten years. The record also shows that, before assuming the Birmingham position, Rascoe had been a supervisor at another Ceco facility. When that facility closed, he was moved into the vacancy at the Birmingham plant. Although Huntley had been at the Birmingham facility earlier and was qualified, he did not have as much experience as Rascoe. Huntley did supervise the evening shift, although he reported to Rascoe, who supervised the day shift. Evidence that Greg Hogland was promoted is not indicative of discrimination unless there is a showing that he was less qualified than the senior employees who were bypassed. The statistical evidence regarding discipline in 1984 does not establish or necessarily imply racially discriminatory practices. Thompson v. Leland Police Dept., 633 F.2d 1111, 1114 (5th Cir.1980). It compares discipline imposed on collective bargaining employees with the total number of employees in the entire workforce, not just collective bargaining employees. Comparative evidence derived from more than one year would be more indicative of illicit practices. None of this evidence is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.
