DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (Cont.)

Assessing whether Defendants have met their burden on summary judgment involves adhering to principles from precedent. Specifically, summary judgment is improper if the moving party fails to produce evidence establishing the absence of genuine issues of material fact. As emphasized in Giannullo, "the non-movant is not required to rebut an insufficient showing" (322 F.3d at 141). Furthermore, the court must ensure the moving party’s Rule 56.1 statement is substantiated by record evidence, as reliance solely on unverified assertions can compromise judicial fact-finding (Giannullo, 322 F.3d at 143 n. 5).

Unopposed summary judgment may also fail if the movant does not demonstrate entitlement to judgment as a matter of law (Champion v. Artuz, 76 F.3d 483, 486 (2d Cir. 1996)). Should there be ambiguity in the grounds of a summary judgment order, remand is necessary for clarity and correctness (Miranda v. Bennett, 322 F.3d 171, 175 (2d Cir. 2003)).

Additionally, under Local Rule 56.1, the moving party's burden is to explicitly reference admissible evidence supporting each undisputed fact. Unsupported facts, despite being uncontroverted, must be disregarded, necessitating an independent review of the record (322 F.3d 139).

In light of these principles and precedents, Defendants’ motion for summary judgment appropriately addresses and substantiates their claims, meeting the legal standards required.

gold_text: . The Rule 56.1 Statements of Undisputed Facts submitted by each party in support of their respective motions contain a litany of allegedly "disputed” facts. The Court, therefore, looks beyond these statements and recites the facts as they appear in the record. See Vt. Teddy Bear Co., Inc. v. 1-800 Beargram Co., 373 F.3d 241, 244 (2d Cir.2004) (requiring District Courts to look beyond parties’ Rule 56.1 statements to ensure that "the citation to evidence in the record supports the assertion” (citing Giannullo v. City of N.Y., 322 F.3d 139, 143 n. 5 (2d Cir.2003))).
