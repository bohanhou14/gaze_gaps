The court must consider the language, structure, and legislative history of § 1985(3) to determine whether a conspiracy to deprive a person of rights, privileges, or immunities under state law or those protected against private action by the Federal Constitution or federal statutory law exists. In the case of Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971), the Supreme Court emphasized that § 1985(3) was intended to reach private conspiracies that did not involve the State.

In this case, the court must examine whether the alleged conspiracy to deprive plaintiffs of a certificate of location approval was motivated by racial, political, or otherwise class-based discriminatory animus. Hampton v. Hanrahan, 600 F.2d 600, 623 & n. 22 (7th Cir.1979), modified on other grounds, 446 U.S. 754, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980), held that § 1985(3) reaches discrimination based on political affiliation with racial overtones.

The court finds that the alleged conspiracy was motivated by political affiliation and not racial or other class-based discriminatory animus. As a result, the court grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismisses the § 1985(3) claim. The court also dismisses the pendent state law claims.

In summary, the court finds that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under § 1985(3) and pendent state law claims. The court grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismisses the case.

gold_text: Without necessarily adhering to plaintiffs’ view that the majority in United Brotherhood of Carpenters v. Scott, 463 U.S. 825, 103 S.Ct. 3352, 77 L.Ed.2d 1049 (1983), tilted toward finding that § 1985(3) could encompass politically-based discrimination, the complaint fails to satisfy the earlier and clear ruling of Keating v. Carey, 706 F.2d 377, 386-88 (2d Cir.1983). There, our Court of Appeals held that the allegations of a New York civil servant, active in Republican party affairs, (a) that he was informed that he would be removed from his tenured post once the Democratic administration of Governor Carey took office, (b) that he was so removed, and (c) that he was subsequently and wrongly misled to believe that he enjoyed no tenure rights in the first place, satisfied the Griffin requirement under § 1985(3) of a proscribed discriminatory animus based on his affiliation as a Republican. The court held:
