In this case, the district court granted Ferland's request for attorneys' fees, but reduced the award by a significant amount. Ferland appeals the fee award, arguing that the district court abused its discretion in calculating the fee award. The court held that the district court's calculation of the fee award was unclear and failed to provide a concise explanation for its decision.

The court first addressed the issue of time attributed to the Michel claim. Ferland's attorney had requested compensation for 290 hours of time, but the district court reduced this figure to 261.2 hours. The court found that the district court's calculation was unclear and remanded the matter for further proceedings.

The court also addressed the issue of the percentage reduction of the fee award. The district court reduced the fee award by more than half, citing the relative lack of complexity of the case, the lack of jury trial experience of counsel, and the attorney's inefficiency in prioritizing time. The court found that the district court's explanation was inadequate and remanded the matter for further proceedings.

In reaching its decision, the court relied on several cases, including Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), Gates v. Deukmejian, 987 F.2d 1392 (9th Cir. 1992), and McGrath v. County of Nevada, 67 F.3d 248 (9th Cir. 1995). The court held that the district court's calculation of the fee award was unclear and failed to provide a concise explanation for its decision, and therefore remanded the matter for further proceedings.

In conclusion, the court's decision highlights the importance of providing a clear and concise explanation for the calculation of attorneys' fees. The court's reliance on cases such as Hensley v. Eckerhart and Gates v. Deukmejian emphasizes the need for district courts to provide a thorough and well-reasoned explanation for their decisions. The court's remand of the matter for further proceedings ensures that the district court will have the opportunity to provide a clear and concise explanation for its decision. <answer>

gold_text: . District courts must calculate awards for attorneys' fees using the "lodestar” method. See Caudle v. Bristow Optical Co., Inc., 224 F.3d 1014, 1028 (9th Cir.2000); Morales v. City of San Rafael, 96 F.3d 359, 363 (9th Cir.1996). "The lodestar’ is calculated by multiplying the number of hours the prevailing parly reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate.” Morales, 96 F.3d at 363. Although in most cases, the lodestar figure is presumptively a reasonable fee award, the district court may, if circumstances warrant, adjust the lodestar to account for other factors which are not subsumed within it. See, e.g., Van Gerwen v. Guarantee Mut. Life Co., 214 F.3d 1041, 1046 (9th Cir.2000); see also Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., 526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir.1975) (enumerating factors district courts may consider in determining fee awards).
