In this case, the court is faced with a motion to dismiss and/or for sanctions due to the plaintiff's failure to preserve certain cassette recordings. The recordings were crucial to the defendants' defenses, but they were lost or destroyed by the plaintiff's investigator, Mesis. The defendants are seeking sanctions, including dismissal of the case, because of the plaintiff's alleged intentional destruction of evidence.

In determining whether to grant the defendants' motion, the court must consider the factors outlined in Reference case 747 F.2d 863. Specifically, the court must weigh the extent of the plaintiff's dilatory behavior, the importance of the missing evidence, and the potential prejudice to the defendants.

In this case, the plaintiff's failure to preserve the recordings is seen as a deliberate act, as Mesis admitted to not keeping the recordings after they were transcribed. This suggests that the plaintiff may have intentionally destroyed the evidence to avoid disclosing it to the defendants. Additionally, the court notes that the plaintiff's counsel failed to brief the concern about what the jury might learn from Mesis' notes, which further supports the inference of intentional destruction.

Therefore, the court cannot say that the plaintiff's actions were not willful or intentional, as required by Reference case 850 F.2d 152. In light of this, the court denies the defendants' motion for sanctions, as the plaintiff's actions do not rise to the level of intentional destruction of evidence.

The court's decision is guided by the principles outlined in Reference case 747 F.2d 863, which emphasize the importance of considering the extent of the plaintiff's dilatory behavior, the importance of the missing evidence, and the potential prejudice to the defendants. In this case, the court finds that the plaintiff's actions do not justify the imposition of sanctions, and the case will proceed as scheduled.
