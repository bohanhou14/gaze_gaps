Plaintiff’s contention that his procedural due process rights were violated because he could not be present during the Review Committee’s deliberations and because the Committee did not make detailed findings of fact must fail. In Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334-35 (1976), the Supreme Court outlined three factors to consider in determining what process is due: the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation through the procedures used, and the government's interest. Applying these factors, the value of additional procedural safeguards, such as allowing the presence during deliberations or requiring detailed findings, is marginal. The university's interest in maintaining administrative efficiency and preventing disruptions to its nonresident tuition program outweighs these minimal procedural enhancements.

Furthermore, Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943), underscores the necessity of respecting the administrative procedures tailored to specific regulatory schemes. Just as the state courts in Burford were deemed adequate to address statutory interpretations and related disputes, the university's internal processes are sufficient to adjudicate tuition classification. Analogously, judicial interference in the absence of a clear constitutional transgression disrupts established administrative protocols, as indicated in Carriers Assn. v. MacMullan, 424 U.S. 800.

Therefore, the procedural framework established by the university, which provides multiple opportunities for review and appeal, aligns with constitutional mandates and respects the administrative autonomy underscored in the referenced cases.

gold_text: It is not the function of this Court, as a Court of the United States, to become embroiled in the day-to-day administration of the University of Iowa’s nonresident fee program. The University has important financial interests in the program. It has promulgated rules and adopted a procedure for administering the program. Mr. Osmundson, by his own lack of actions, prevented the Review Committee from taking any action on his alleged application, and the Court does not know what the Committee’s decision would have been. The Court is asked in effect to decide whether a decision that was never made was arbitrary and capricious. The issue is a constitutional one and was not clearly presented to the Court on an unambiguous record. Under these circumstances, the Court would abstain from ruling on Mr. Osmundson’s claim even if a case or controversy existed. Cf. Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 814-16, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976); Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943). The Court sees no need to order a remand of Mr. Osmundson’s case to the Review Committee in view of the fact that he has the right under the Board of Regents’ rules to make a new application for resident classification during each semester or session he attends the University.
