In the case at hand, the district court submitted the question of obviousness to the jury, who found that the Ebelings' patent was obvious. The district court then held that the patent was invalid as a matter of law. The Ebelings appealed, arguing that the district court abused its discretion in submitting the question of obviousness to the jury.

The Court of Appeals noted that the question of obviousness is a mixed question of law and fact, and that the district court's decision in this regard is subject to de novo review. The Court cited Tuttle v. Fouche, 502 F.2d 9, which held that the district court's decision on the issue of obviousness is not entitled to deference. The Court also cited Vance v. Irvin, 594 F.2d 499, which held that the district court's decision on the issue of obviousness is subject to de novo review.

The Court then analyzed the evidence presented by the Ebelings and concluded that it was not sufficient to support a finding of non-obviousness. The Court noted that the prior art presented by Pak-Mor's expert witness was more pertinent than that considered by the Patent Office when it issued the Ebelings' patent, and that the differences between the prior art and the Ebelings' invention were such that the subject matter of the invention would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art. The Court cited Whitley v. Road Corp., 624 F.2d 698, which held that the question of obviousness is one of law and that the district court's decision on this issue is subject to de novo review.

The Court therefore affirmed the district court's decision, holding that the Ebelings' patent was invalid as a matter of law. The Court noted that the decision was consistent with the principles of patent law, as set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, which held that the question of obviousness is one of law and that the district court's decision on this issue is subject to de novo review.

In conclusion, the Court's decision in this case is consistent with the principles of patent law and the case law in this area. The Court's analysis of the evidence presented by the Ebelings and Pak-Mor's expert witness was thorough and well-reasoned, and the Court's decision to affirm the district court's decision was
