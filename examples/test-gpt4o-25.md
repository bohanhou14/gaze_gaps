F. PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS AGAINST THE PARENT CORPORATION, HOME DEPOT, ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE OF CONTROL OVER EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

In addition to the above findings, a significant point of consideration is whether Defendant Home Depot, as the parent company, can be held liable for the alleged discriminatory actions of its subsidiary, National Blinds & Wallpaper, Inc., where Plaintiff Chris Jenkins was employed. Under well-established precedent, a parent company is typically not liable for the discriminatory practices of its wholly-owned subsidiary unless there is evidence of pervasive control over the subsidiary’s employment decisions.

In reference case 650 F.2d 990, it was held that a parent corporation is not liable for Title VII violations of its wholly owned subsidiary in the absence of special circumstances indicating direct involvement or control over the subsidiary’s employment practices. Similarly, the ruling in 3 F.3d 1357 affirmed that plaintiffs failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact to dispute the presumption that the parent company was not the employer of the subsidiary's employees when there was no evidence of undercapitalization or ignorance of corporate formalities.

Moreover, as pointed out in 162 F.3d 1062, significant factors such as the handling of payroll, approval of employment applications, and direct control over labor relations can establish such liability. Here, plaintiffs have provided no evidence to demonstrate that Home Depot exercised such control over National Blinds & Wallpaper’s employment practices. Consequently, the Court finds no basis to hold Home Depot liable under Title VII for the actions of its subsidiary.

For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendant Home Depot based on the theory of parent-subsidiary liability must be dismissed.

CONCLUSION
For all of the foregoing reasons,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED and Plaintiffs’ Complaint is dismissed in its entirety, with prejudice.
Let Judgment be entered accordingly.

gold_text: It is well-settled that, in the absence of special circumstances, a parent corporation is not liable for the Title VII violations of its wholly owned subsidiary. See Watson v. Gulf & W. Indus., 650 F.2d 990, 993 (9th Cir.1981). See also, Frank v. U.S. West, Inc., 3 F.3d 1357, 1362 (10th Cir.1993) (the "doctrine of limited liability creates a strong presumption that a parent company is not the employer of its subsidiary's employees, and the courts have found otherwise only in extraordinary circumstances.”) Such "exceptional circumstances” exist where the parent corporation exercises a degree of control that exceeds that normally exercised by a parent corporation. See id. at 1363. See also, Lock-ard v. Pizza Hut, Inc., 162 F.3d 1062, 1071 n. 2 (10th Cir.1998).
