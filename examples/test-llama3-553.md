The court's decision in the case of Universal Pictures Company, Inc. and Universal Film Exchanges, Inc. v. T.C. Theatre Corporation (75-213) is to disqualify Mr. Cooke from acting as counsel for the plaintiff in any capacity so long as Universal is a party defendant. This decision is based on the principle that a lawyer's duty of absolute loyalty to his client's interests does not end with his retainer, and that where any substantial relationship can be shown between the subject matter of a former representation and that of a subsequent adverse representation, the latter will be prohibited.

The court cites Canon 6 of the Canons of Professional Ethics adopted by the American Bar Association, which provides that the obligation to represent the client with undivided fidelity and not to divulge his secrets or confidences forbids also the subsequent acceptance of retainers or employment from others in matters adversely affecting any interest of the client with respect to which confidence has been reposed.

The court also notes that the government's success in the Paramount case against Universal and others was made possible in part by the confidential information and documents that were made available to the government through the attorney-client relationship between Universal and its counsel. The court finds that Mr. Cooke's former representation of Universal in the Paramount case is substantially related to the present representation of the plaintiff, and that Mr. Cooke may have acquired information related to the subject of his subsequent representation.

The court further notes that the decree obtained in the Paramount case would prima facie establish that Universal and other defendants were engaged in a nation-wide conspiracy which in enumerated ways affected the local independent exhibitor, and that Mr. Cooke's services on behalf of Universal in the Paramount case included the preparation, drafting, presentation and argument in support of the findings of fact, conclusions of law and decree proposed by Universal, as well as opposition to those offered by the government and some of the other defendants.

In addition, the court finds that Mr. Kahan's representation of Cooke in the suit to recover the balance of fees does not depend upon the disclosure of confidential communications, and that there is no direct evidence that Cooke has passed on any confidential information to Kahan.

The court also denies the motion to disqualify Messrs. Gorfinkle & Adler, finding that there is no basis for the claim that they must have retained Cooke in order to make use of confidential information he received in the course of his former employment.

In conclusion, the court's decision
