**Generation:**

The discrepancy between Ms. Daley’s deposition and her subsequent affidavit raises significant issues under the well-settled principle in this circuit that a party cannot create a genuine issue of fact by submitting an affidavit that contradicts prior deposition testimony without a satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy. See Mack v. United States, 814 F.2d 120, 124 (2d Cir.1987); 125 F.3d 55. In Mack, the court found that affidavits conflicting with earlier deposition testimony should be disregarded when considering summary judgment motions. This rule is intended to ensure the utility of summary judgment as a method to eliminate sham issues of fact. Similarly, in Hayes v. New York City Dep’t of Corrections, the court emphasized that affidavits contradicting previous deposition testimony serve to eliminate genuine issues of fact that would otherwise not exist. Hayes v. New York City Dep’t of Corrections, 84 F.3d 614, 619 (2d Cir.1996).

In this case, Ms. Daley’s affidavit, which asserts new details regarding her telephone conversation with the McNeil representative, directly contradicts her earlier deposition testimony. Applying the principles from Mack and Hayes, the court should disregard these conflicting statements in deciding the motion for summary judgment. Admitting such discrepancies would undermine the purpose of Rule 56. Therefore, the representation by McNeil through the "800" number cannot be deemed an actionable express warranty based solely on the plaintiff's conflicting accounts.

gold_text: Under the law in this Circuit, a Court considering a motion for summary judgment may not rely on an affidavit that contradicts a party’s deposition testimony. Mack v. United States, 814 F.2d 120, 124 (2d Cir.1987) (“It is well settled in this circuit that a party’s affidavit which contradicts his own prior deposition testimony should be disregarded on a motion for summary judgment”); Raskin v. The Wyatt Company, 125 F.3d 55, 63 (2d Cir.1997) (“[W]e follow the rule that a party may not create an issue of fact by submitting an affidavit in opposition to a summary judgment motion that, by omission or addition, contradicts the affiant’s previous deposition testimony.”). In the present case, there is a conflict between the plaintiffs sworn testimony and her affidavit. The former indicates that plaintiff did not advise McNeil of her specific symptoms in 1997, while the affidavit drafted for this motion avers the contrary. I must treat plaintiffs deposition testimony as true for purposes of this motion.
