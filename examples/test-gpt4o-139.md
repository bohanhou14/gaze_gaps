**Generation:**

Defendant Raether's reliance on the “exculpatory no” doctrine as elucidated in United States v. Taylor is misplaced due to significant subsequent legal developments. The Supreme Court's decision in Hubbard v. United States, which overruled United States v. Bramblett, fundamentally changed the application of § 1001, undermining the bases upon which Taylor was decided. The en banc Fifth Circuit in United States v. Rodriguez-Rios explicitly discarded the "exculpatory no" exception, and similarly, the Second Circuit rejected the doctrine in United States v. Wiener.

Moreover, supporting cases cited in Taylor have either been vacated or overruled, such as United States v. Steele, where the Sixth Circuit criticized and declined to adopt the Ninth Circuit’s five-factor test and revisited the viability of the “exculpatory no” doctrine. The supposed applicability of this doctrine in marginal circumstances raises material concerns. 

In United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, the court held that choosing to file a fraudulent form to evade other legal consequences constituted a violation of § 1001. This applies here because Raether’s statement, “I don’t know anything about that okay? All I do is acquire the stuff for the Seminoles, okay?” is not merely a simple exculpatory denial but an active misrepresentation, which is outside the narrow exceptions accepted. Reinforcing this, the Supreme Court in Dennis (396 U.S. 64) highlighted that § 1001 covers intentional falsehoods regardless of the context, aligning with the broader statutory intent.

Therefore, Raether’s assertion that his statement falls within the "exculpatory no" exception is unpersuasive, as his actions align more closely with affirmative misstatements than mere denials. Hence, his motion to dismiss Count II is properly denied.

Our legal system provides methods for challenging the Government’s right to ask questions — lying is not one of them.” Bryson v. United States, 396 U.S. 64, 72, 90 S.Ct. 355, 360, 24 L.Ed.2d 264 (1969) (footnote omitted). See also United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 90 S.Ct. 363, 24 L.Ed.2d 275 (1969). [The defendant] could have refused to answer the incriminating question. Or, if he reasonably believed that he would lose his job for refusing to answer, he could have answered without waiving his fifth amendment privilege, [cited case omitted] Instead, he chose a third, unprotected response: He lied. He cannot now avail himself of the fifth amendment.
