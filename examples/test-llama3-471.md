The case before us raises the question of whether the Secretary of War can alter the privilege or authority given by the acts of 1862 and 1865 to the Louisville Bridge Company, and enforce against the company the provisions of section 18 of the act of 1899, without giving the company compensation to be measured by the increased cost. In Union Bridge Co. v. United States, 204 U. S. 364 (51 L. Ed. 523), the Supreme Court held that requiring alterations in a bridge was not a taking of private property for public use.

In Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States, 216 U. S. 177 (54 L. Ed. 435), the court held that the mere silence of Congress and its failure to directly interfere and prevent the original construction of the bridge, under the authority of Pennsylvania, imposed no constitutional obligation on the United States to make compensation for subsequent changes or alterations, which the public good, in its judgment, required to be made.

The court also cited the case of United States v. Cincinnati, etc., Co., 134 Fed. 353 (67 C. C. A. 335), where it was held that the replacement of a wooden bridge by an iron one was not the erection of a new bridge. In United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 229 U. S. 244 (57 L. Ed. 1169), the court said that it did not feel free to follow the rulings in the Parkersburg Bridge Case, as they did not support the grant of the right to build the bridge under the terms specified in the act of 1862.

In conclusion, the Secretary of War can alter the privilege or authority given by the acts of 1862 and 1865 to the Louisville Bridge Company, and enforce against the company the provisions of section 18 of the act of 1899, without giving the company compensation to be measured by the increased cost. This is because requiring alterations in a bridge is not a taking of private property for public use, and the company is only entitled to the privilege or authority given to it by the acts, without any reservation of the right to amend or alter.

gold_text: In the case of Union Bridge Co. v. United States, 204 U. S. at page 400, 27 Sup. Ct. 367, 51 L. Ed. 523, and in Hannibal Bridge Co. Case, 221 U. S. at page 207, 31 Sup. Ct. 603, 55 L. Ed. 699, the court used language in substance the same as that we have extracted from 216 U. S. 193, 194, 30 Sup. Ct. 356, 54 L. Ed. 435. The lesson we take from this is that the general principle thus stated will ultimately be applied indiscriminately to cases where there was such reservation and to those where there was none, and that the question reserved in United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 229 U. S. 254, 33 Sup. Ct. 850, 57 L. Ed. 1169, and in Bridge Co. v. United States, 105 U. S. 476, 26 L. Ed. 1143, will be so determined as definitely to support the paramount authority of Congress over the navigable waters of the United States, regardless of the apparent injustice and hardship which the courts may be compelled to inflict, in the absence of an exercise by Congress of its exclusive power to. provide for compensation to owners of bridges situated as is the defendant in this case. Hard as this result may be, it cannot be harder than that of nullifying contracts of great importance between individuals, as was done in the Mottley Case and many others.
