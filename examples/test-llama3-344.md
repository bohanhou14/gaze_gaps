In the case of Wood v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that the sentencing guidelines are advisory, not mandatory. The Court held that the guidelines are designed to provide a starting point for sentencing, but that the judge has the discretion to consider other factors and impose a sentence that is more or less severe than the guideline range.

In this case, the defendant, Jaymie Mount, was sentenced to 100 months in prison for possession of a gun by a felon. Mount argued that the district court erred by denying his request for an additional one-level reduction under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), which provides for a one-level reduction if the defendant “has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently.”

The government contended that the decision to award the reduction is discretionary with the court, citing cases such as United States v. Anderson, 604 F.3d 997 (7th Cir. 2010), and United States v. Leahy, 464 F.3d 773 (7th Cir.2006). However, the Supreme Court has held that the guidelines are advisory, not mandatory, and that the judge has the discretion to consider other factors and impose a sentence that is more or less severe than the guideline range (see 543 U.S. 220).

In this case, the district court denied Mount's request for the additional reduction, citing the fact that Mount had fled from the residential facility where he was supposed to be staying and had to be apprehended by the Marshals Service. However, the Supreme Court held that the district court erred by denying the reduction, citing the language of U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b) which provides for a one-level reduction if the defendant "has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently." (see 552 U.S. 85).

In conclusion, the Supreme Court held that the district court erred by denying Mount's request for an additional one-level reduction under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), and that

gold_text: We are not persuaded by the reasoning in Williamson. As we have explained at length, § 3El.l(b) uses mandatory language in instructing the district court how to calculate the offense level when the government has made the necessary motion. This, in our view, is a textual argument that cuts against the Fifth Circuit’s approach. Although we are not charged with maintaining consistency in the Fifth Circuit’s law, we note that Williamson is in considerable tension with other cases from that circuit, including Tello, 9 F.3d at 1124, and Velgar-Vivero, 8 F.3d at 242. We have already explained why we do not regard Application Notes 5 and 6 as a source of support for the Williamson result; there is no need to repeat that discussion here. Finally, Williamson seems to proceed from the mistaken premise that if the district court is directed by the guidelines to compute a certain offense level, then that is the level within which the defendant must be sentenced. We would have thought that seven years after United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was decided, this fallacy would have been put to rest. Over and over, the Supreme Court has emphasized that district courts have discretion over sentences, so long as they begin with a proper calculation of the recommended sentencing range under the guidelines and they then take proper account of the sentencing considerations outlined in § 3553(a). See, e.g., Spears v. United States, 555 U.S. 261, 263, 129 S.Ct. 840, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009); Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U.S. 85, 91, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007); Gall, supra. Even within the more limited context of guidelines computations, the district judge is responsible for the most important input into the acceptance of responsibility decision: whether the defendant is entitled to the first two levels pursuant to § 3El.l(a).
