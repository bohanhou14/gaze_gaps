In this case, the court's decision to award punitive damages must be evaluated in light of the jury's answers to the special verdict form. The court found that the jury's answers to interrogatories 1, 5, and 8 did not support an award of punitive damages, citing Stancill v. McKenzie Tank Lines, Inc., 497 F.2d 529, 534-35 (5th Cir.1974). However, the court also noted that the jury's answer to interrogatory 11, which asked whether Gant acted with malice or reckless disregard, was inconsistent with the previous answers.

In Morrison v. Frito-Lay, Inc., the court held that a court may return a jury for further deliberation to clarify their verdict where their special verdict answers are inconsistent. 823 F.2d 1366. In this case, the court did not allow the jury to reconsider their verdict, and instead, the court annexed Gant's stipulation into the verdict and accepted the amalgam as consistent.

The court's decision to award punitive damages was based on the jury's answer to interrogatory 11, which was found to be inconsistent with the previous answers. The court cited Griffin v. United Airlines, Inc., which held that a verdict is not inconsistent merely because it is difficult to reconcile with other answers. 707 F.2d 1253. However, in this case, the court's finding of inconsistency was based on the jury's answer to interrogatory 11, which was not supported by the evidence.

In conclusion, the court's decision to award punitive damages was based on the jury's answer to interrogatory 11, which was inconsistent with the previous answers. The court's finding of inconsistency was based on the jury's answer to interrogatory 11, which was not supported by the evidence. Therefore, the court's decision to award punitive damages was error. 671 F.2d 946.

gold_text: Even if construed as a challenge to the verdict’s consistency, however, Gant’s appeal is waived. In this circuit, all challenges to the consistency of special verdicts must be raised before the jury is excused. ITEL Capital Corp. v. Cups Coal Co., Inc., 707 F.2d 1253, 1261 (11th Cir.1983) ("[Ajppellants waived their objection to alleged inconsistencies in the jury’s answers to the special interrogatories [propounded pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(a) ] by failing to object at the time the verdict was rendered.”); Stancill v. McKenzie Tank Lines, Inc., 497 F.2d 529, 534 (5th Cir.1974) (same; Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b)). But see Pierce v. Southern Pacific Trans. Co., 823 F.2d 1366, 1370 (9th Cir.1987) (failure to object constitutes waiver only under Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b) and not under 49(a)); Mercer v. Long Mfg. N.C., Inc., 671 F.2d 946, 947-48 (5th Cir. Unit A 1982) (same). As the proper remedy for an inconsistent verdict is resubmission of the case to the jury, Gant's rejection of Judge Castagna’s offer to do so constitutes waiver of any later challenge to the consistency of the verdict.
