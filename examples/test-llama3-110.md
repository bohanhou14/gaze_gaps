Here is the analysis of the case:

The court is considering the motion for attorney's fees and costs. The court applies the factors in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.1974) to determine the reasonable hourly rate and the reasonable hours spent on the case.

The court finds that the case involved new and complex questions of copyright law, including the copyrightability of taxidermy forms, for which no precedent existed in the Fourth Circuit. This factor favors the reasonableness of the requested hourly rates.

The court also considers the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys. Mr. Giordano enjoys a good reputation, and his ability is respected in the community. Mr. Butler maintains an established practice in intellectual property law both in Northern Virginia and in Tidewater.

The court awards a fee of $68,400.75, based on billable hours and for the reasons set forth above. The court also awards costs, as the parties have agreed to deduct the sum of $262.50 from the attorney's fees request. The court finds that the award of costs is reasonable and just, as the parties have agreed to the deduction and there is no evidence to suggest that the deduction is unreasonable.

In conclusion, the court grants the motion for attorney's fees and costs, and awards a fee of $68,400.75 and costs of $262.50. The award is based on the factors set forth in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., and is reasonable and just.

gold_text: In determining an award of attorney’s fees, “[l]itigation expenses, such as supplemental secretarial costs, copying, telephone costs, and necessary travel, are integrally related to the work of an attorney ...” and, thus, are compensable. Wheeler v. Durham City Bd. of Educ., 585 F.2d 618, 623-24 (4th Cir.1978) (attorney’s fees awarded as a part of costs in 20 U.S.C. § 1617 action); Daly, 790 F.2d at 1083 (attorney’s fees awarded as a part of costs in 42 U.S.C. § 1988 action). This rule extends to awards of attorneys fees in copyright cases. See 17 U.S.C. § 505 (providing for “a reasonable attorney’s fee to the prevailing party as a part of the costs.”). In addition, because computer assisted research will reduce the number of hours an attorney must dedicate to a case, those charges comprise part of the costs. Wehr v.
