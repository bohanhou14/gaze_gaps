gold_text: “Placing limits on contributions which in turn limit expenditures plainly impairs freedom of expression.” Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290, 299, 102 S.Ct. 434, 70 L.Ed.2d 492 (1981). It is well-settled that “[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976). FFLF’s “ability to speak is undoubtedly limited when it cannot raise money to pay for speech.” See Texans for Free Enter., 732 F.3d at 539. The relief FFLF seeks would fill the gap that exists in the state campaign finance law, which pre-dates Citizens United and its progeny and does not define, or exclude from the law’s reach, independent expenditure-only committees. FFLF has established irreparable injury that cannot be compensated with post-election relief or after-the-fact money damages.
