To review the case, I will analyze the evidence presented and consider the legal standards set forth in reference cases 474 U.S. 214 and 976 F.2d 791.

The plaintiff, Marie Powell, alleges that she was discriminated against by the University of Connecticut School of Medicine (UConn) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (National Board) due to her alleged disability, which was diagnosed as dyslexia and attention deficit disorder (ADD). Powell claims that UConn required her to pass Step I of the medical licensing examination, which she was unable to do, and therefore discriminated against her. She also claims that the National Board denied her request for an accommodation, which was an extended time to take the exam, and therefore discriminated against her.

In reviewing the evidence, I find that Powell failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act. First, Powell failed to demonstrate that she was a qualified individual with a disability. Although she was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADD, she presented no evidence that these conditions substantially limited her major life activities. Second, Powell failed to establish that she was otherwise qualified to continue as a medical student at UConn. Her academic record, including her undergraduate GPA and MCAT scores, suggests that she was not qualified to participate in the medical program.

Furthermore, I find that the National Board did not discriminate against Powell by denying her request for an accommodation. The Board's decision was based on the fact that Powell's documentation failed to establish that she was disabled and that her documentation did not include objective evidence of difficulties she experienced before entering medical school.

In conclusion, based on the evidence presented, I find that Powell failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. The University of Connecticut School of Medicine and the National Board of Medical Examiners did not discriminate against Powell by requiring her to pass Step I of the medical licensing examination and denying her request for an accommodation. The district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants was appropriate.

gold_text: When reviewing the substance of a genuinely academic decision, courts should accord the facultyâ€™s professional judgment great deference. See Regents of Univ. of Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 225, 106 S.Ct. 507, 88 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985). A sister circuit facing a similar issue observed that the medical school had diligently assessed the available options and then made an academic judgment that a reasonable accommodation was not available and, that to accommodate the student would work a change in the substance of its medical program, and impose an undue hardship on its academic program. Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of Med., 976 F.2d 791, 795 (1st Cir.1992). In the pending case, after diligent review, UConn made a similar rational decision.
