**Generation:**

In the context of determining fraud under § 523(a)(2)(A), it is essential to demonstrate fraudulent intent or a reckless disregard for the truth, tantamount to willful misrepresentation (515 F.2d 260). The precedent cases underscore that mere false representations, without the element of intent, fail to meet the threshold of actionable fraud under the bankruptcy code. As seen in Wright's scenario (515 F.2d 260), material misrepresentations alone do not equate to fraudulent behavior unless coupled with a fraudulent intent.

Similarly, in Abbott's case (516 F.2d 830), the court affirmed the necessity of intent to deceive, establishing that failure to disclose prior obligations on a loan application is a materially false representation when done with the intent to deceive. The court's findings, based on observing Abbott's demeanor and intent, mirrored the requirement of demonstrating a clear fraudulent intent.

Applying these standards to the present case, the plaintiff’s evidence notably lacks any indication of fraudulent intent or moral turpitude on the part of the defendant debtor when the post-dated checks were issued. The honoring of the initial three checks further mitigates against a finding of fraudulent intent. Therefore, as no proof of positive fraud is evidenced, the debt is dischargeable under § 523(a)(2)(A).

In conclusion, based on the aforementioned references and the plaintiff’s failure to provide evidence of intentional fraud or false pretenses, the court rightly grants the defendant’s motion for dismissal and awards attorney's fees of $100 as requested.
