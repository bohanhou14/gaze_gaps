Expert analysis of the legal cases provided reveals that the rights of creditors Nelson and Elizabeth Torres to the payment of interest on Claim # 13 should be determined according to applicable state law. In this case, the Civil Code of Puerto Rico is relevant.

As stated in Article 1138 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, "In obligations to do, the debtor shall also be released when the prestation appears to be legally or physically impossible." However, as mentioned in Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48 (1979), the legal and physical impossibility contemplated by law are not present in this contested matter.

Furthermore, Article 1061 of the P.R.Civil Code provides that when the obligation consists in the payment of a sum of money, and the person incurs in default, the creditor is entitled to be indemnified for damages and losses suffered, which will consist in the payment of interest. In the absence of an agreed-upon interest rate, the legal interest rate at 6% per annum shall be applied, as stated in 11 U.S.C. Section 502(b)(2).

In reference to Bankruptcy Judge James F. Queenan, Jr.'s opinion in In re Prichard Plaza Associates Limited Partnership, 84 B.R. 289 (Bkrtcy.D.Mass.1988), the Court finds that Mr. Bonilla must reimburse the full amount of the option contract paid by Mr. Torres, plus interest at the legal rate of 6% per year, from the date the option contract expired to the date this petition was filed.

Also, considering the reference case 114 B.R. 326, U.S.C. ยง 363(b)(1), "Property of the estate" includes "all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case." However, in this case, the option contract was signed before the bankruptcy petition was filed, and the plot of land was sold after the filing with the authority of the Court.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of the legal cases provided, the Court concludes that the creditors Nelson and Elizabeth Torres are entitled to the payment of interest on Claim # 13, and the applicable interest rate is 6% per annum, as stated in 11 U.S.C. Section 502(b)(2).
