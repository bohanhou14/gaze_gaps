We find that the application of law as set forth in various precedents supports our conclusion. Most notably, the basic principle that a criminal statute must give fair warning of the conduct that it makes a crime has often been recognized by this Court, as evidenced by United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612 (1954). In this case, the fundamental fairness in prosecution and clarity of statutory prohibition are paramount, aligning with the ruling in Connolly v. General Const. Co., 269 U.S. 385, reinforcing the necessity for explicit statutory terms (378 U.S. 347).

Relating to appellant's assertion under multiple theories of guilt, it is necessary to highlight Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347 (1964), which underscores that a defendant cannot be convicted of a crime without fair notice if such notice was insufficient at the time of action. Similarly, as elucidated in United States v. Roa, 12 M.J. 210, 212-13 (CMA 1982), and corroborated by the case 30 M.J. 195, even where a statute or specification may cause incongruous results, the law as explicitly stated by Congress or prevailing rules must be upheld to avoid judicial legislation and ensure due process.

In sum, the evidence and statutory provisions, when viewed collectively, affirm the adequacy of appellant's conviction under Article 118(3). Therefore, the findings of guilty and the sentence are sustained accordingly, bolstered by fair statutory notice and supported by consistent case law jurisprudence.
