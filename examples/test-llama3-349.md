The district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Miller and Aerotek is affirmed. Keen's argument that Mississippi law imposes a duty on employers to conduct criminal background checks, at least within the factual circumstances of this case, is unavailing. The unanimous rule from around the country is that there is no generalized duty on employers to conduct pre-employment background checks on all new hires, irrespective of the particular circumstances of their prospective employments. (Refer to 953 F.2d 909)

Furthermore, the court's non-compliance with internal corporate hiring policies is not dispositive evidence of negligence under Mississippi law. Non-compliance with internal policies is evidence that is probative of, but not dispositive of, breach of duty. (Refer to Steele v. Inn of Vicksburg, Inc., 697 So.2d 373)

In addition, the report of Keen's expert and the testimony of Miller's corporate representative do not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Miller and Aerotek should have known of Robertson's violent propensity. The district court's conclusions of law are supported by the evidence and are therefore affirmed.

In summary, the court's grant of summary judgment is affirmed because there is no genuine issue of material fact and one party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law. (Refer to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a))
