The case at hand involves a claim of securities fraud and unsuitability against defendants, LifeMark Securities Corporation and Jeffrey Morrison. The plaintiff, Alan Fox, alleges that Morrison made knowing recommendations of unsuitable securities, failed to disclose material information, and made misrepresentations about the investments. To succeed on his claim, Fox must prove that the securities purchased were unsuited to his needs, that Morrison knew or reasonably believed the securities were unsuited, and that Morrison made material misrepresentations or failed to disclose material information.

The court must draw all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party, and view the factual assertions in materials such as affidavits, exhibits, and depositions in the light most favorable to Fox. However, a non-moving party benefits from such factual inferences only if there is a genuine dispute as to those facts. (Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).

In determining the suitability of the investments, courts consider factors such as the investor's financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. (First Nationwide Bank v. Gelt Funding Corp., 27 F.3d 763, 769-70 (2d Cir.1994)).

Here, the court finds that Morrison's recommendations were based on Fox's financial goals and risk tolerance, and that Morrison disclosed the risks associated with each investment. Although Fox disputes receiving or reviewing the prospectuses of the investments, the court finds that Morrison's recommendations were reasonable in light of Fox's financial situation and goals.

In conclusion, the court grants summary judgment in favor of defendants, finding that Fox failed to raise a triable issue of fact on his claim of securities fraud and unsuitability. The court relies on the cases of Suez Equity Investors v. Toronto-Dominion Bank, 250 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir.2001) and Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 243-44 (1988), which establish the requirements for a securities fraud claim.

gold_text: Only materially misleading statements or material omissions give rise to liability. See In re Hardinge, Inc. Sec. Litig., 696 F.Supp.2d 309, 320 (W.D.N.Y.2010). “For an undisclosed fact to be material, there must be a ‘substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available.’ ” Castellano v. Young & Rubicam, Inc., 257 F.3d 171, 180 (2d Cir.2001), quoting Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-232, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988). While not required to disclose all known information, a defendant must “disclose any information that is necessary to make [his] other statements not misleading.” In re Alliance Pharm. Corp. Sec. Litig., 279 F.Supp.2d 171, 182 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (emphasis added).
