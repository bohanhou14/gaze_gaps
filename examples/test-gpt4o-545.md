III.
Fuller asserts that the detectives' search of his backyard was unlawful because the principle of "hot pursuit" did not justify the intrusion. However, as established in precedent, the hot pursuit doctrine permits warrantless entry when a suspect, fleeing from a public place, seeks refuge in a private area (427 U.S. 38). In that case, the Court determined that the short duration of a chase does not negate its classification as a hot pursuit.

Although Fuller argues a 12-minute pursuit had become "cold," the hot pursuit doctrine does not require an extended chase; it necessitates the continuity of an immediate pursuit (427 U.S. 38). Moreover, similar to the precedent concerning minor offenses (466 U.S. 740), the pursuit involved a serious matter—apprehending suspects of a stolen vehicle. Importantly, upon visualizing Detective LaGrasta, Fuller attempted to discard a firearm, which heightened immediate safety concerns and justified the warrantless entry under exigent circumstances (466 U.S. 740).

Therefore, based on the exigent nature of the situation and applicable legal precedents, the detectives' actions were justified. Consequently, the District Court did not err in denying Fuller’s motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search and subsequent statements. 

Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the District Court.
