E. Burden of Proof in Sentencing

Olis also challenges the district court's use of a preponderance of the evidence standard for finding facts that significantly increased his sentencing range. Citing reference cases, Olis asserts that a higher standard of proof should have been applied. In Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 477 U.S. 79, the Supreme Court noted that sentencing courts traditionally rely on a preponderance of the evidence standard, and heightened proof burdens are not typically constitutionally required for sentencing determinations (477 U.S. 79). However, in Kikumura v. United States, 918 F.2d 1084, the court highlighted that certain extreme sentencing enhancements might warrant clear and convincing evidence due to the significant liberty interests at stake (918 F.2d 1084).

Given that Olisâ€™s sentence was significantly lengthened based on judge-found facts, revisiting the standard of proof applied may be necessary during resentencing. Sentencing courts must carefully balance the need for procedural protections against established judicial practices. Therefore, to align with both historical practices and protect substantial liberty interests, the district court should reconsider the appropriateness of the preponderance standard for the enhancements at Olis's resentencing.

Kikumura, 918 F.2d 1084 (3d Cir. 1990) supported his contention that a standard higher than preponderance of the evidence should be used for enhancements that dramatically increase a sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines.
