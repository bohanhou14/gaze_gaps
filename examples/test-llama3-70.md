The court must now determine whether Schulze's obligation to contribute to the Plan ceased prior to April 14, 1980, or if it continued beyond that date. The parties agree that Schulze's obligation to contribute under its collective bargaining agreement with the IAM ceased on April 14, 1980. However, the question remains whether Schulze's obligation to contribute continued after that date "as a result of a duty under applicable labor-management relations law." 29 U.S.C. § 1383.

In Republic Industries, Inc. v. Central Pennsylvania Teamsters Pension Fund, 693 F.2d 290 (3d Cir. 1982), the court held that an employer's obligation to contribute to a multiemployer plan continued after the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement where the parties continued to bargain in good faith. In this case, however, the parties did not reach an impasse until April 15, 1980, which is a significant date in determining Schulze's obligation to contribute.

As stated in Peckham v. I.A.M. National Pension Fund, Benefit Plan C, 641 F.2d 734 (9th Cir. 1981), an employer's duty to bargain in good faith continues even after the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement. Therefore, Schulze's obligation to contribute to the Plan continued after April 14, 1980, until the parties reached an impasse on April 15, 1980.

In conclusion, Schulze's obligation to contribute to the Plan ceased on April 15, 1980, when the parties reached an impasse and the employer withdrew from the bargaining process. The court finds that the date of Schulze's withdrawal from the Plan was April 15

When the employer and the union have bargained to impasse, the employer is then free to institute unilateral changes in terms and conditions of employment that were reasonably comprehended by the employer’s pre-impasse bargaining proposals. Clear Pine Mouldings, Inc. v. NLRB, 632 F.2d 721, 729 (9th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 984,101 S.Ct. 2317, 68 L.Ed.2d 841 (1981); NLRB v. Skywolf Sales, 470 F.2d 827, 830 (9th Cir. 1972). If Schulze and the union wer-e at impasse on April 15, 1980, if Schulze then implemented its own pension plan and ceased contributing to the IAM Plan, and if there was no other source of duty requiring Schulze to continue making contributions, then Schulze “ceased to have an obligation to contribute,” i.e. withdrew from the Plan as of that date.
