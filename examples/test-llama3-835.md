In the context of legal cases, a prompt identification of a suspect close to the time and place of an offense is considered a fair and reliable method of identification, as seen in Wise v. United States, 127 U.S.App.D.C. 279, 383 F.2d 206 (1967). The court held that a witness's identification of a suspect shortly after the crime was not impermissibly suggestive, as the witness had a clear opportunity to observe the suspect's features.

In another case, Russell v. United States, 133 U.S.App.D.C. -, 408 F.2d 1280 (1969), the court affirmed the conviction of a defendant who was identified by a witness shortly after the crime. The court held that the identification was not obtained in impermissibly suggestive circumstances and was therefore reliable.

In the case of Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967 (1967), the court held that the absence of counsel from an identification conducted immediately after the crime did not foreclose the government from using that identification. The court found that the circumstances of the identification were not impermissibly suggestive and that the witness's identification was based on an independent source.

In conclusion, the courts have consistently held that a prompt identification of a suspect close to the time and place of an offense is a fair and reliable method of identification. The cases of Wise v. United States, Russell v. United States, and Stovall v. Denno support this conclusion and demonstrate the importance of considering the circumstances of the identification in determining its reliability.
