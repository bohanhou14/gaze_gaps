In determining whether the additional one-level reduction under § 3E1.1(b) is mandatory upon the government's motion, the court's task is to ensure that the sentencing process remains consistent with Sixth Amendment principles, as emphasized in Booker, 543 U.S. 220. The court’s focus must be to preserve the substantive guarantees of the Sixth Amendment rather than adhering strictly to procedural formalism.

In the instant case, the district court's refusal to grant the additional one-level reduction based on Mount's flight disregards the principles established in Booker and other precedents. A proper application of § 3E1.1(b) should align with the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines while ensuring uniform national sentencing standards. As noted in Gall, 552 U.S. 38, courts must use the Guidelines as a starting point and an initial benchmark.

Moreover, the efficient allocation of resources, including the government's and the court’s, is a key factor underpinning § 3E1.1(b), as noted in subsequent rejections of mandatory disparities in crack versus powder cocaine sentencing disparities (see 555 U.S. 261 and 552 U.S. 85). Therefore, once the government makes the required motion, the additional one-level reduction should generally follow, with limited exceptions based on specific and justifiable grounds relating to sentencing goals under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). 

Given these principles, we conclude that Mount's case warrants the additional reduction, subject to remand for resentencing to properly reflect the advisory Guidelines’ framework while ensuring a just and appropriate sentence.

gold_text: We are not persuaded by the reasoning in Williamson. As we have explained at length, § 3El.l(b) uses mandatory language in instructing the district court how to calculate the offense level when the government has made the necessary motion. This, in our view, is a textual argument that cuts against the Fifth Circuit’s approach. Although we are not charged with maintaining consistency in the Fifth Circuit’s law, we note that Williamson is in considerable tension with other cases from that circuit, including Tello, 9 F.3d at 1124, and Velgar-Vivero, 8 F.3d at 242. We have already explained why we do not regard Application Notes 5 and 6 as a source of support for the Williamson result; there is no need to repeat that discussion here. Finally, Williamson seems to proceed from the mistaken premise that if the district court is directed by the guidelines to compute a certain offense level, then that is the level within which the defendant must be sentenced. We would have thought that seven years after United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was decided, this fallacy would have been put to rest. Over and over, the Supreme Court has emphasized that district courts have discretion over sentences, so long as they begin with a proper calculation of the recommended sentencing range under the guidelines and they then take proper account of the sentencing considerations outlined in § 3553(a). See, e.g., Spears v. United States, 555 U.S. 261, 263, 129 S.Ct. 840, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009); Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U.S. 85, 91, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007); Gall, supra. Even within the more limited context of guidelines computations, the district judge is responsible for the most important input into the acceptance of responsibility decision: whether the defendant is entitled to the first two levels pursuant to § 3El.l(a).
