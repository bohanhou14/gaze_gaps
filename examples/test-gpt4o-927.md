The Inmates further argue that § 3626(b)(2) offends the Due Process Clause by retroactively altering their rights under the consent decree, akin to the issues raised in reference case 467 U.S. 717, where the retroactive application of a statute was challenged on constitutional grounds. In 467 U.S. 717, the court upheld the retroactive application, noting that legislation must be evaluated through a rational basis test, focusing on whether it is arbitrary or irrational. Similarly, § 3626(b)(2) aims to streamline judicial oversight and is not arbitrary or irrational, thus passing constitutional muster.

Finally, the Inmates argue that § 3626(b)(2) violates the principle of non-interference with final judgments, akin to the situation in 428 U.S. 1. In 428 U.S. 1, the legislation in question did not require reopening of final judgments but provided a structural guideline for future cases. Here, § 3626(b)(2) acts similarly, by setting standards for ongoing and future prison condition litigations, rather than reopening settled matters. This alignment with 428 U.S. 1 further validates the provision's constitutionality.

In summation, considering the references to 467 U.S. 717 and 428 U.S. 1, § 3626(b)(2) does not infringe upon the Due Process Clause through retroactive application or by violating principles of final judgment non-interference.

gold_text: The Inmates next raise a due process challenge to § 3626(b)(2) on the basis that it operates retroactively. The Inmates rely on the rule set forth in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. RA. Gray & Co., 467 U.S. 717, 104 S.Ct. 2709, 81 L.Ed.2d 601 (1984), that retroactive application of legislation must pass a due process test not required for legislation having only future effects, namely, “that the retroactive application of the legislation [must be] justified by a rational legislative purpose.” Id. at 730, 104 S.Ct. at 2718 (citing Usery v. Turner Elkhom Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 16-17, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2892-93, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976)). The Inmates assert that, regardless of whether the prospective application of § 3626(b)(2) passes constitutional muster, there is no rational legislative purpose justifying the'retroactive application of § 3626(b)(2).
