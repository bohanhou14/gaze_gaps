**Generation:**

In the context of judicial errors under Rule 60(b)(1), this court adopts the reasoning elucidated in Gila River Ranch, Inc. v. United States, 368 F.2d 354 (9th Cir. 1966), which supports correction of mistakes by the trial court within a reasonable time to avoid the inconvenience and expense of an appeal. Rule 60(b) allows flexibility for the court to address judicial errors, an interpretation bolstered by academic commentary emphasizing the trial court's power for self-correction (Gila River Ranch, Inc., 368 F.2d at 356).

The law within this circuit is that errors of law are indeed cognizable under Rule 60(b), as reiterated in other cases. As per the principle expounded in Conway v. Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., 644 F.2d 1059, 1062 (5th Cir. 1981), lower courts are free to decide issues on remand unless previously decided explicitly or by necessary implication, reflecting the "law of the case" doctrine (691 F.2d 438).

Thus, this court concurs that Allstate's motion for relief fails procedurally and substantively, considering the exclusionary provision's invalidity under Montana's statutory framework. This determination aligns with the court’s obligation to correct judicial errors for legal soundness and procedural correctness.
