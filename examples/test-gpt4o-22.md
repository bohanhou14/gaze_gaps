In this case, the question arises whether Kaufman was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. This issue is closely related to the principles laid out in the reference cases. 

According to 377 U.S. 201 (Massiah v. United States), the Sixth Amendment provides a specific guarantee that government agents cannot elicit incriminating statements from an indicted individual in the absence of counsel. Kaufman's situation bears some similarity; after counsel was appointed, Agent Peet interviewed him without his lawyer present. 

Furthermore, in 360 U.S. 315 (Spano v. New York), the Court highlighted the conflict between efficient law enforcement and protecting individual rights. Spano’s case underscored the necessity for law enforcement to observe constitutional protections, a principle applicable to Kaufman’s context regarding the admissibility of statements obtained without counsel.

Referencing 335 F.2d 176 (Massiah Appeal), we note the exclusion of evidence obtained through surreptitious interrogation after indictment due to the Sixth Amendment violation. Kaufman’s post-appointment interviews should similarly be scrutinized for potential breaches of constitutional rights.

Thus, the propriety of these interviews and their impact on effective assistance of counsel should be examined in light of the referenced precedents, potentially calling for reconsideration of the admissibility of such evidence and ensuring Kaufman's rights were fully upheld.
