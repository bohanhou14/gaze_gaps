The relevant case law reinforces the stance that Brumbaugh’s rights under USERRA are unequivocally protectable. In the precedent set by case reference 600 F.2d 1070, courts upheld the application of legislation to state and local governments despite potential conflicts with the Tenth Amendment, emphasizing the broad scope of congressional power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Furthermore, the principle from case reference 167 F.2d 175 underscores that no practice of employers can curtail benefits guaranteed to veterans by Congress, encouraging a liberal construction of the Act in favor of returning servicemembers.

Additionally, case reference 804 F.2d 821 supports the interpretation that the rights and benefits provided by USERRA are not limited by semantic definitions or employer practices, emphasizing that returning servicemembers should be granted equitable treatment akin to their peers. Based on Brumbaugh’s established seniority and the legal precedent, the court finds the arguments favoring his due compensation and employment benefits, as well as the proration of his clothing allowance, compelling. This ruling aligns with the holistic and generous reading of veteran reemployment rights mandated by USERRA.

Therefore, the court affirms its stance on awarding Brumbaugh the disputed clothing allowance and denies liquidated damages due to the absence of willful noncompliance by the Plaintiff, aligning with the benchmarks set in the referenced cases.
