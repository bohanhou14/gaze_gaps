Plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to retaliation for filing a complaint. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that (1) she participated in a protected activity, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action as established in Aryain v. Watt-Mart Stores Tex. LP, 534 F.3d 473, 484 (5th Cir.2008). Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not demonstrated the requisite elements to support her claim.

Plaintiff claims that she was subject to retaliatory actions, including negative performance evaluations and termination, after filing her complaint. However, actionable retaliation under Title VII must involve a "materially adverse" action that would dissuade a reasonable employee from making a charge of discrimination, as defined by Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006). The adverse actions cited by Plaintiff do not rise to this standard. 

Additionally, according to Fifth Circuit precedent, retaliatory conduct must amount to an "ultimate employment decision" such as termination or demotion to be actionable (Mattern v. Eastman Kodak Co., 104 F.3d 702, 707 (5th Cir.1997)). In this case, while negative performance evaluations and questioning of health conditions could be viewed as adverse, they do not satisfy the requirement of being "materially adverse" workplace alterations that would dissuade a reasonable employee from pursuing a discrimination claim.

Based on the lack of materially adverse actions that meet the stringent requirements set forth in 586 F.3d 321, no plausible Title VII retaliation claim is stated. Consequently, Defendants' motion to dismiss the retaliation claim should be granted.

gold_text: The final claim asserted in the Complaint is retaliation. Plaintiff alleges that she filed a complaint with the OIG and then feared for her job. No other facts are provided concerning this claim. A plaintiff alleging retaliation must show that: (1) she participated in a Title VII protected activity, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action by her employer, and (3) that there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. Stewart v. Mississippi Transportation Commission, 586 F.3d 321, 331 (5th Cir.2009). While not limited to ultimate employment decisions, “[t]he antiretaliation provisions protect an individual not from all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm.” Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co., 548 U.S. 53, 67, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2414, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). To be an adverse employment action for purposes of establishing retaliation, the action must be “materially adverse.” Id. at 68, 126 S.Ct. at 2415. A plaintiff must show “that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.” Id. “[P]etty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience,” which may include personality conflicts and “snubbing,” are not actionable.
