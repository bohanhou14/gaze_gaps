However, it should be noted that the issue of a confession's voluntariness cannot be lightly disregarded. In reference to case 373 U.S. 503, the Supreme Court has emphasized that when a Fifth Amendment violation, such as a coerced confession, is alleged, it must be the subject of an independent determination. This means that state court determinations regarding the voluntariness of confessions must be critically examined to ensure adherence to constitutional protections. 

Additionally, as demonstrated in case 378 U.S. 368, the resolution of disputes concerning the conditions under which a confession was obtained is crucial. The facts surrounding Tucker’s alleged waiver and subsequent confession require a reliable adjudication to ascertain whether undue coercion or threats influenced his statements, thus questioning the voluntariness of the confession.

Moreover, drawing from case 361 U.S. 199, we understand that mental coercion, akin to physical coercion, can render a confession involuntary. The claims of threats and deception raised by Tucker's counsel necessitate thorough scrutiny. If indeed his confession was influenced by such coercive tactics, it would grievously breach the Fourteenth Amendment, necessitating exclusion from evidence.

Thus, while the overwhelming evidence against Tucker potentially renders any constitutional error harmless, a rigorous examination of the circumstances surrounding his confession remains essential to uphold the integrity of constitutional rights.

Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 205-208, 80 S.Ct. 274, 4 L.Ed.2d 242 (1960) Neither the physical or mental coercion nor the trickery that was practiced in the cited cases occurred here; this record does not support such a claim. Consequently, the general statement in Payne v. Arkansas which we have quoted, supra, applicable there, is obviously inapplicable here. Even if Tucker’s allegations of improper officer conduct could be substantiated and his confession were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights, a reversal of the conviction and a remand for a new trial would be an act of complete futility. Without the evidence of the confession and of the recovered loot appellant’s guilt was overwhelmingly proved by other clearly constitutionally admissible evidence.
