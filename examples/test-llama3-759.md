Based on the case, it is evident that there was an unauthorized settlement between the United States and the landowners. The Assistant U.S. Attorney, Robert Greene, agreed to the stipulation without the proper authority or approval from the National Park Service or the Department of Justice. This is in violation of the regulations and directives issued by the government, which require that settlements or compromises be approved in writing by the authorized field representative of the acquiring agency if the amount exceeds the amount deposited with the declaration of taking.

The court has consistently held that a district attorney of the United States has no power to agree upon a compromise of a claim in suit except under circumstances not present in this case. (United States v. Beebe, 180 U.S. 343, 21 S.Ct. 371, 45 L.Ed. 563 (1901)). This is further supported by the regulation that states that no district attorney shall agree to take a judgment or decree for a less amount than is claimed by the United States without express instructions from the Solicitor of the Treasury. (United States v. Stewart, 311 U.S. 60, 70).

Given the unauthorized settlement and the lack of proper approval, the judgment should be set aside. The court should not enforce the settlement against the United States, as it was not made in accordance with the regulations and directives issued by the government. (United States v. Stewart, 311 U.S. 60, 70).

The estoppel arguments advanced by the defendants-appellees are not applicable in this case, as we deal with a compromise and settlement of a federal case which settlement was unauthorized under federal law. (Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, 243 U.S. 389).

In conclusion, the judgment should be set aside due to the unauthorized settlement and the lack of proper approval. The court should not enforce the settlement against the United States, as it was not made in accordance with the regulations and directives issued by the government. (United States v. Beebe, 180 U.S. 343, 21 S.Ct. 371, 45 L.Ed. 563 (1901)).
