Plaintiff argues that summary judgment was inappropriate due to unresolved factual issues, particularly concerning the alleged bad faith of the defendant. Rule 56(e) mandates that an adverse party must set forth "concrete particulars" and cannot rely on mere allegations or promises of future evidence, as elucidated in Donnelly v. Guion, 467 F.2d 290, 293 (2d Cir. 1972) and Dressler v. The MV Sandpiper, 331 F.2d 130, 133 (2d Cir. 1964). Here, the plaintiff failed to present concrete evidence essential to establish material facts in opposition (585 F.2d 31; 523 F.2d 461).

Furthermore, plaintiff's allegations of bad faith and slander of title lack the requisite specificity. The standard for malice in slander of title cases requires a clear and convincing demonstration of the defendant’s malicious intent, beyond mere conjecture (619 F.2d 932). The district court's finding that defendant’s actions were consistent with the contractual terms negates the presence of malice, as there was no failure to cooperate unjustifiably (594 F.2d 923).

In Herrmann v. Brooklyn Law School, 576 F.2d 453, plaintiff’s similar failure to offer specific evidence precluded recovery. As this Court consistently requires concrete evidence over speculative claims, summary judgment was properly granted in this case, affirming Judge Motley's decision.

However, when a motion for summary judgment is made and supported, as it was in this case, the opposing party may not rest upon mere conclusory allegations or denials. SEC v. Research Automation Corp., 585 F.2d 31, 33 (2d Cir. 1978). A plaintiff does not become entitled to a jury trial simply by asserting a cause of action in which the defendant’s state of mind is a material element. Hahn v. Sargent, 523 F.2d 461, 468 (1st Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 1495, 47 L.Ed.2d 54 (1976). Some facts must be asserted to support the claim that the state of mind existed.
