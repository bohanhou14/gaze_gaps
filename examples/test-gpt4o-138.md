The district court's approach also contrasts with precedents such as United Airlines, Inc., 432 U.S. 385, reinforcing that attempting to join the case at a late stage doesn't automatically justify outright denying intervention if it serves a limited and specific purpose (712 F.3d 925 at 932). Moreover, the argument that extensive progress in litigation before intervention is sufficient for denial (226 F.3d 467 at 472) does not hold, as Mason and Ivy sought to ensure their interests post-class denial and filed timely after final judgment, aligning precisely with the principles set forth in McDonald and supported by Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 462 U.S. 385, 398 (1982), thus making the district court's stance an abuse of discretion.

Hence, we conclude the district court improperly applied procedural expectations set by precedents, resulting in an abuse of discretion. We REVERSE the decision and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

gold_text: In addition, Baptist and Methodist argue that the district court did not err in applying McDonald because this court previously considered the decision in determining that Bachelder’s motion to intervene was untimely, and Mason’s and Ivy’s attempt to distinguish their purpose in intervening from Bachelder’s “gets them nowhere.” The defendants contend that Ivy and Mason cannot avoid the same analysis “by narrowly defining their interest as limited to appealing the denial of class certification.” Neither McDonald nor subsequent decisions from this circuit bear this principle out. McDonald explicitly recognized that unnamed plaintiffs may intervene “for the purpose of appeal,” including for the purpose of appealing a denial of class certification. 432 U.S. at 395, 97 S.Ct. 2464 (emphasis added); see also Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U.S. 301, 303-04, 108 S.Ct. 586, 98 L.Ed.2d 629 (1988) (per curiam) (recognizing that a non-party may intervene for the limited purpose of taking an appeal); Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345, 348 n. 1, 103 S.Ct. 2392, 76 L.Ed.2d 628 (1983) (same). We have also recently reaffirmed that Rule 24 permits “limited-in-scope intervention,” including intervention “for the limited purpose of appeal.” United States v. City of Detroit, 712 F.3d 925, 931-32 (4th Cir.2013) (citing McDonald, 432 U.S. at 394, 97 S.Ct. 2464). The purpose of intervention is a substantial factor to consider in making a timeliness determination, and an individual’s limited purpose in intervening may make an otherwise inexcusable delay reasonable under the circumstances. See Stupak-Thrall v. Glickman, 226 F.3d 467, 479 n. 15 (6th Cir.2000) (noting that courts should consider “whether the lack of an earlier motion to intervene should be excused, given the proposed intervenor’s purpose,” as “when [a] proposed intervenor seeks to intervene late in the litigation to ensure an appeal” (emphasis added)).
