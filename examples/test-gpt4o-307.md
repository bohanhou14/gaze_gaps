To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Dollis must show: (1) she engaged in a protected activity under Title VII; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the activity and the adverse employment action (10 F.3d 292; 970 F.2d 39). The district court found Dollis failed to demonstrate these elements adequately.

Firstly, Dollis engaged in protected activity by filing administrative complaints alleging discrimination. Secondly, Dollis asserts the denial of a desk audit, promotion, and attendance at a training conference as adverse actions. However, the magistrate found these do not constitute "adverse personnel actions" under Title VII.

Further, Dollis cannot establish a causal connection. The evidence indicated the denial of the desk audit and other alleged retaliatory actions were due to nondiscriminatory reasons relating to the agency's administrative procedures and not her filing of complaints (10 F.3d 292). The protection under Title VII doesn't extend to actions that are not directly tied to tangible job benefits or significant workplace changes (970 F.2d 39), and Dollis' claims fall short here.

Thus, the magistrate properly granted summary judgment to the Secretary on Dollis' retaliation claims, lacking the requisite evidence to support all elements of a prima facie case of retaliation.

gold_text: A showing of three elements is required in order to make out a prima facie case of retaliation: (1) the plaintiff engaged in activity protected by Title VII; (2) an adverse employment action occurred; and (3) there was a causal connection between the participation in the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Barrow v. New Orleans S.S. Ass’n, 10 F.3d 292, 298 (5th Cir.1994) (citing Shirley v. Chrysler First, Inc., 970 F.2d 39, 42 (5th Cir.1992)). There can be no question that Dollis’ retaliation claims satisfy the first element of the analysis, filing an administrative complaint is clearly protected activity. However, we agree with the magistrate’s finding that none of Dollis’ retaliation complaints involved adverse personnel actions.
