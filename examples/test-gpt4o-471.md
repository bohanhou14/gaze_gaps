The rulings in the Union Bridge Co. v. United States (51 L. Ed. 523) and Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States (54 L. Ed. 435) cases have firmly established that requiring alterations to bridges over navigable waters does not constitute a taking of private property within the meaning of the Constitution. Furthermore, the Hannibal Bridge Co. v. United States (55 L. Ed. 699) case reinforced this notion, confirming that such alterations, mandated by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of War, do not necessitate compensation. Additionally, the precedent set in United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. (57 L. Ed. 1169) suggests that any compensation claims stemming from necessary alterations of a bridge under federal authority are unlikely to have merit. Finally, referencing the foundational principles laid out in Bridge Co. v. United States (26 L. Ed. 1143), it is evident that Congressâ€™s paramount power to regulate commerce justifies its actions concerning bridge modifications without the requirement of just compensation for the owners. In summary, the Secretary of War's order stands constitutionally and does not obligate compensation.

gold_text: In the case of Union Bridge Co. v. United States, 204 U. S. at page 400, 27 Sup. Ct. 367, 51 L. Ed. 523, and in Hannibal Bridge Co. Case, 221 U. S. at page 207, 31 Sup. Ct. 603, 55 L. Ed. 699, the court used language in substance the same as that we have extracted from 216 U. S. 193, 194, 30 Sup. Ct. 356, 54 L. Ed. 435. The lesson we take from this is that the general principle thus stated will ultimately be applied indiscriminately to cases where there was such reservation and to those where there was none, and that the question reserved in United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 229 U. S. 254, 33 Sup. Ct. 850, 57 L. Ed. 1169, and in Bridge Co. v. United States, 105 U. S. 476, 26 L. Ed. 1143, will be so determined as definitely to support the paramount authority of Congress over the navigable waters of the United States, regardless of the apparent injustice and hardship which the courts may be compelled to inflict, in the absence of an exercise by Congress of its exclusive power to. provide for compensation to owners of bridges situated as is the defendant in this case. Hard as this result may be, it cannot be harder than that of nullifying contracts of great importance between individuals, as was done in the Mottley Case and many others.
