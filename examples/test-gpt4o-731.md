B. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS (continued)

In determining the proper statute of limitations for Section 1983 actions, federal courts customarily borrow the state statute of limitations for analogous causes of action (446 U.S. 478). However, the characterization of Section 1983 claims for statute of limitations purposes is inherently a matter of federal law, influenced primarily by the elements of the cause of action and Congress' intent (471 U.S. 261). Although the district court applied the two-year limitations period consistent with Georgia law (O.C.G.A. § 9-3-33), it overlooked the federal doctrine that a Section 1983 claim accrues when the plaintiff knows or should know of the injury and its cause (794 F.2d 624).

Applying this principle, Mullinax’s claims arising from the entrapment efforts did not accrue until she became aware of the harm and the involvement of Keller and Sticher. Given her arrest on August 12, 1982, which revealed the full extent of her injury and the responsible parties, her action filed on August 9, 1984, falls within the statutory period as mandated by federal law. Hence, the district court’s decision to dismiss the entrapment, conspiracy, and harassment claims as time-barred was incorrect.

Accordingly, we reiterate our affirmation of the district court’s summary judgment on the false accusation and malicious prosecution claims. Yet, we reverse the summary judgment on the remaining claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion (468 U.S. 42).

AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.

Although Section 1983 does not contain a specific statute of limitations, 42 U.S. C.A. § 1988 directs courts in Section 1983 actions to apply the most appropriate and analogous state statute of limitations. Burnett v. Grattan, 468 U.S. 42, 47-48, 104 S.Ct. 2924, 2928, 82 L.Ed.2d 36 (1984); Board of Regents v. Tomanio, 446 U.S. 478, 483-86, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 1794-96, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980). In Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 276-79, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1947-49, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985), the Supreme Court interpreted the dictates of Section 1988 as requiring in all Section 1983 actions the application of the state limitations statute governing "personal injury” claims. Thus, under Wilson, the proper limitations period for all Section 1983 actions in Georgia is the two-year limitations period set forth in O.C.G.A. § 9-3-33. Williams v. City of Atlanta, 794 F.2d 624, 626 (11th Cir.1986). Furthermore, in Williams, this Court determined that Wilson is to be applied retroactively, at least in Section 1983 cases arising out of Georgia. Id. at 625-28. See abo Jones v. Preuit & Mauldin, 763 F.2d 1250, 1253 n. 2 (11th Cir.1985), cert. denied, _ U.S. _, 106 S.Ct. 893, 88 L.Ed.2d 926 (1986) (applying Wibon retroactively in Alabama Section 1983 case where parties did not dispute its retroactivity). Therefore, this action is barred unless commenced within two years of its accrual.
