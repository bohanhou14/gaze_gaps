gold_text: The applicable standard for imposition of Rule 38 sanctions in this Circuit is slightly unclear. In several instances we have stated that Rule 38, like § 1927, requires a showing that the appeal is frivolous as well as “a clear showing of bad faith.” In re Hartford Textile Corp., 659 F.2d 299, 305 (2d Cir.1981) (per curiam), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1018, 102 S.Ct. 1714, 72 L.Ed.2d 136 (1982); see also Hirschfeld v. Spanakos, 104 F.3d 16, 20 (2d Cir.1997) (“The standard for sanctioning a party for bringing an appeal or motion is whether the sanctioned party acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, etc.”); Schiff v. United States, 919 F.2d 830, 834 (2d Cir.1990) (per curiam) (concluding that the situation before the Court “is one of those highly unusual instances which permit the imposition of sanctions under Rule 38 because of a clear showing of bad faith”) (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1238, 111 S.Ct. 2871, 115 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1991). We have at other times also stated that a showing of bad faith is not required for an imposition of sanctions under Rule 38. See In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, Inc., 995 F.2d 1138, 1147 (2d Cir.1993) (“The standard for the imposition of [sanctions under Rule 38] is where the appeal taken is found to be groundless, without foundation, and without merit, even though appellant did not bring it in bad faith.”); S.R. Mercantile Corp. v. Maloney, 909 F.2d 79, 82-83 (2d Cir.1990) (regarding the Tenth Circuit’s articulation in Braley v. Campbell, 832 F.2d 1504, 1512 (10th Cir.1987), as “defining the standard for imposition of sanctions on an attorney under Rule 38,” which requires only “reckless disregard of the attorney’s duties to the' court”). In addition, the Sixth Circuit has recently noted that a split exists among the circuits as to whether “bad faith” or “intentional misconduct” is a requirement for Rule 38 sanctions, although it noted that the majority of circuits have not imposed such a requirement. See Wilton Corp. v. Ashland Castings Corp., 188 F.3d 670, 676-77 (6th Cir.1999) (collecting cases and deciding that the Sixth Circuit does not require a showing of bad faith). We do not find it necessary to choose between these standards in deciding whether to impose sanctions under Rule 38, because Papapanayo-tou’s conduct on appeal rises even to the level of bad faith.
