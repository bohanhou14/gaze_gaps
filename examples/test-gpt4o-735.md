Regarding bid preparation and proposal costs, Geo-Seis is entitled to recover costs that are deemed reasonable and allocable under the regulations. Part XV of the regulations defines such costs as including “the development of engineering data and cost data necessary to support the contractor’s bids or proposals.” 41 C.F.R. § 1-15.205-3 (1983). These costs are recoverable to the extent they are both reasonable and allocable. See 961 F.2d 951, 961 F.2d 951. The Claims Court further clarified that in a negotiated procurement, costs incurred due to ongoing negotiations with the government and in support of a revised proposal can also be considered proposal preparation costs. 41 C.F.R. § 1-3.805-1 (1984).

In this case, the government has conceded a total award to Geo-Seis of $61,954.46 for bid preparation and proposal costs. This acceptance indicates that the costs incurred by Geo-Seis fall within the parameters established by the regulations and precedent as noted in 961 F.2d 951. Given this clarity, Geo-Seis’ application for these costs is reasonable and thus warranted.

gold_text: Bid preparation and proposal costs are defined by regulation as “costs incurred in preparing, submitting, and supporting bids and proposals (whether or not solicited) on potential [government or non-[g]overnment contracts.” FAR § 31.205-18(a). These costs are allowed to the extent that they are both allocable and reasonable. FAR § 31.205-18(c); see Coflexip & Servs., Inc. v. United States, 961 F.2d 951, 953 (Fed.Cir. 1992) (discussing provisions identical to those of the current FAR, which then existed in a regulation that has since been repealed). A claimed cost is generally viewed as reasonable “if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business.” FAR § 31.201-3(a). A claimed cost is generally viewed as allocable if it “is incurred specifically for the contract.” FAR § 31.201-4(a). Expenses compensable as bid preparation costs are those in the nature of researching specifications, reviewing bid forms, examining cost factors, and preparing draft and actual bids. Lion Raisins v. United States, 52 Fed.Cl. 629, 631 (2002). GeoSeis bears the burden of proving that it is entitled to recover its costs. Id.
