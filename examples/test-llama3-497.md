gold_text: Pineiro argues that the district court erred in applying the enhancement because the evidence showed only that he sold a substantial amount of drugs to his accomplices, not that he acted as a leader of the enterprise. As he points out, several circuits have held that a buyer-supplier relationship is insufficient to qualify for the “organizer or leader” sentence enhancement. See United States v. Sayles, 296 F.3d 219, 225 (4th Cir.2002) (citing cases). This record, however, discloses evidence that goes well beyond a mere buyer-seller relationship between Pineiro and his co-conspirators. The evidence permits the conclusion, for instance, that Pineiro directed and paid several couriers, including a courier who acted for a co-eonspirator. The general character of the evidence, as a fact-finder could view it, is that Pineiro oversaw the logistics of a drug-distribution scheme in which he had drugs delivered from Mexico to his property in Texas and then acted as the exclusive supplier to several co-conspirators in Louisiana over the course of several years. The evidence here is thus not unlike that in past cases in which we have upheld the organizer enhancement. See United States v. Cooper, 274 F.3d 230, 246-47 (5th Cir.2001); United States v. Castillo, 77 F.3d 1480, 1493 (5th Cir.1996). Further, our precedents permit the district judge to consider the quantity of drugs supplied as one factor among others in considering the organizer enhancement, see United States v. Valencia, 44 F.3d 269, 273 (5th Cir.1995), and, on the basis of the district court’s factual findings, a substantial amount of drugs was indeed involved. The evidence was conflicting on many issues, but we cannot say that we are left with a firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Therefore, there was no clear error in imposing the enhancement.
