In the case of Biggs v. Edwin L. Wiegand Company, we are considering whether the defendant's employment practices were discriminatory towards women, specifically married women. The plaintiffs, Mrs. Jurinko and Mrs. Seibert, alleged that they were not hired by the company because of their marital status, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The district court found that the company did not have a general policy of discriminating against married women, but rather, the discrimination was against the specific plaintiffs. The court concluded that the company's failure to hire the plaintiffs was due to a "bona fide occupational qualification" (BFOQ) based on sex, as the company believed that women were physically unable to perform certain jobs in the production department.

On appeal, we find that the district court's conclusions are correct. As stated in Richardson v. United Steel Corp., 424 F.2d 331 (3 Cir. 1970), a BFOQ must be based on individual capacities, not stereotyped characterizations. The company's assumption that women are physically unable to perform certain jobs is not a valid BFOQ, and therefore, the discrimination is unlawful.

Furthermore, the court's conclusion that the company did not have a general policy of discriminating against married women is supported by the evidence. As stated in Cox v. United States Gypsum Co., 409 F.2d 289 (C.A. 7, 1969), the burden is on the defendant to prove that the failure to hire
