In assessing whether the defendants' conduct impacted interstate commerce, we can draw parallels from the ruling in 493 F.2d 1124, which determined that the minimal use of interstate facilities did not constitute a substantial impact on interstate commerce. Here, the payments made by Zutler and the attempts to extort payments from Elder-as-Johnson similarly show an insubstantial link to interstate commerce. The funds were primarily personal, and the extortion acts did not deplete business assets in a manner affecting interstate commerce. As in 742 F.2d 340, where compelling prejudice was not demonstrated, this minimal impact on interstate commerce does not meet the threshold to uphold the Hobbs Act charges. Accordingly, the insufficient demonstration of an actual or attempted impact on "commerce" necessitates acquittal on Counts Two through Eight.

gold_text: Once again our Court of Appeals has addressed a closely-related concept only last week in United States v. Vanichromanee, 742 F.2d 340 (7th Cir.1984). In the course of upholding a conviction on charges of interstate racketeering, the Court found interstate travel — a necessary ingredient of that offense, like interstate commerce in a Hobbs Act case — had been “designed to promote, carry on, or further that illegal purpose” (id. at 349). It distinguished other cases where convictions had been reversed because the travel or other necessary federal elements of the crimes charged had been merely “fortuitous or isolated and incidental” (id.). By coincidence one of those cases had also involved one of the early “intangible rights” convictions, that of former Governor and Judge Otto Kerner and former Illinois Director of Revenue Theodore Isaacs, United States v. Isaacs, 493 F.2d 1124, 1146-49 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 976, 94 S.Ct. 3184, 41 L.Ed.2d 1146 (1974). In exactly the sense used by Isaacs and by the other cases cited in Vanichromanee, the government’s invocation of claimed interstate commerce effects here refers to items wholly “fortuitous or isolated and incidental,” and thus insufficient to sustain a conviction.
