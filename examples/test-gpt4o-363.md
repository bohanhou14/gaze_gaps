III. Admission of Evidence Under Rule 403

Mendoza challenges the district court’s admission of certain evidence under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, arguing that its prejudicial impact substantially outweighed its probative value. In particular, Mendoza contends that the introduction of images and symbols associated with drug cartels unfairly prejudiced the jury. 

The review for the proper admission of evidence under Rule 403 is generally for abuse of discretion (976 F.2d 1226). Even if the admission were an abuse of discretion, a defendant must also establish that the evidentiary ruling constituted more than harmless error and that it affected his substantial rights (Id.). The critical question is whether the probative value was “substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice” or “needless presentation of cumulative evidence” (Id.).

In this case, the district court carefully considered the probative value versus the potential for unfair prejudice. The court found that the introduced evidence was highly probative of Mendoza's involvement in a larger criminal enterprise, a central issue to the charges. Just as in the case of Mclnnis, where symbols associated with Nazi imagery were contextually relevant (Id.), here, the cartel imagery was similarly pertinent to the context of Mendoza’s alleged offenses. Mendoza's contention that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial does not demonstrate that the trial court’s admission constituted more than harmless error affecting his substantial rights. Hence, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.

IV. Sentencing Enhancement

Mendoza also argues that the sentencing enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) was improperly applied. In this regard, reference can be made to precedent in which an error of law by the district court concerning sentencing enhancements under the ACCA would relieve the need to address other related arguments (226 F.3d 1075). However, given that the district court did not err in its legal reasoning or application of the sentencing enhancement in Mendoza’s case, his arguments concerning the improper reliance on the Pre-Sentence Investigation (PSI) report and violations of separation of powers are rendered moot. The enhancement, accordingly, stands valid and enforceable.

Thus, having addressed Mendoza’s principal claims in accordance with pertinent legal precedents, his conviction and sentence are affirmed.

gold_text: Nor has Mendoza demonstrated plain error in the district court’s refusal to exclude the evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. See United States v. Matthews, 226 F.3d 1075, 1081-82 (9th Cir. 2000). Balancing under Rule 403 requires consideration of whether the danger of unfair prejudice “substantially outweighed” the probative value of the evidence. United States v. McInnis, 976 F.2d 1226, 1231 (9th Cir.1992). Although the evidence was undoubtedly somewhat prejudicial inasmuch as it revealed that Mendoza was capable of violence, we see no reason to believe that any prejudice was unfair — that is, that the evidence had “an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis.” Id. (quoting Fed. R.Evid. 403 advisory committee notes). Moreover, the potential prejudice did not “substantially outweigh” the clear probative value of the evidence. Id. Thus, it was not plain error to admit the testimony.
