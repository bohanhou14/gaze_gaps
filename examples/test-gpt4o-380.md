We also find support for our decision in Smith v. Evening News Association, 371 U.S. 195, 199 (1962), where the Supreme Court emphasized that Section 301 is to be interpreted broadly to encompass a wide range of disputes arising out of collective bargaining agreements. The Court in Smith clarified that the provision does not narrowly confine jurisdiction to suits directly between unions and employers but extends to any action concerning the interpretation or enforcement of such contracts.

Additionally, in Stelling v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, 587 F.2d 1379, 1383 (9th Cir. 1978), the Ninth Circuit recognized that individual employees could assert claims under collective bargaining agreements, further underscoring the expansive scope of § 301 jurisdiction. This precedent indicates that jurisdiction is not exclusively reserved for formal signatories to the agreement but includes relevant parties whose actions are fundamentally linked to the contract’s provisions.

Given these precedents, the inclusion of the Joint Committee in the present action is consistent with the broader legislative intent to allow federal courts to adjudicate disputes that impact the interpretation and implementation of labor agreements uniformly. This approach aligns with the policy goals expressed in Lucas Flour Co., 369 U.S. 95, by ensuring that collective agreements are enforced cohesively to maintain industrial stability and avoid conflicting interpretations between state and federal courts.

Therefore, we reaffirm that the district court’s exercise of jurisdiction over the Joint Committee under § 301(a) is appropriate and essential for the uniform enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement at issue.

The findings and order of the district court are AFFIRMED.

gold_text: . The Joint Committee probably is not an employer or a labor organization under the Labor Management Relations Act either. We need not rule on that point, however, because it is well settled that parties in a § 301 action do not necessarily have to be employers or labor organizations. The word “between” in § 301(a) refers to “contracts” between an employer and a labor organization, not to “suits” between them. Smith v.
