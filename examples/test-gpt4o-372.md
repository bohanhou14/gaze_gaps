**Generation:**

This Court now addresses the question of whether it should retain supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims following the dismissal of the federal ERISA claim. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), a federal court with original jurisdiction shall exercise supplemental jurisdiction over all related state law claims forming part of the same case or controversy.

In this instance, precedence supports the discretionary nature of retaining jurisdiction over state claims once the foundational federal claim is dismissed. For instance, in the case referenced as 81 F.3d 249, the court exercised informed discretion over whether to adjudicate remaining state law claims after a § 1983 claim was dismissed.

Consistent with the holdings in 221 F.3d 41, where the court declined supplemental jurisdiction following the dismissal of federal claims, this Court, having dismissed the ERISA claims, opts to remand the remaining state law breach of contract claims to Providence County Superior Court. This decision supports the principle that state courts are better suited to resolve purely state law issues. 

Therefore, the Court remands the case for adjudication of plaintiffs' breach of contract claims (Counts I and II) to Providence County Superior Court.

So ordered.

gold_text: This Court concludes that both severance plans in question are not ERISA plans. Therefore, defendant’s motion for summary judgement on plaintiffs ERISA claim (Count III) is granted. The only claims remaining (Count I and II) are for breach of contract implicating state law only. This Court could consider and decide the plaintiffs state law claims only under the supplemental jurisdiction doctrine. The applicable statute states that “in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action ... that they form part of the same case or controversy.” 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a) (1994). However, the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction is discretionary. The Lares Group, II v. Tobin, 47 F.Supp.2d 223, 235 (D.R.I. 1999), aff'd by, Lares Group, II v. Tobin, 221 F.3d 41 (1st Cir.2000). In making its decision the Court should “take into account concerns of comity, judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and the like.” Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 257 (1st Cir.1996). In the past, this Court has been mindful of the concerns of federalism and cautious of wasting federal judicial resources, declining the opportunity to interpret state law in matters devoid of any federal interest. Lares Group II, 47 F.Supp.2d at 235. Plaintiffs breach of contract claims relating to the company stock options and severance pay implicate Rhode Island law and should be decided by the Rhode Island Court where plaintiff originally brought this action.
