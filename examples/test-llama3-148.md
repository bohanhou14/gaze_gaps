Based on the analysis of the reference cases, it is clear that the court's decision to terminate the lease was incorrect. The court relied on the provision in the lease that the lessor could terminate the lease if the lessee failed to make timely payments. However, the lessee made timely payments and the lessor failed to return the deposit of $8,000 as required by the lease. In Reference case 25 L. Ed. 188, the court held that a court of equity is reluctant to make a decree that would effect a forfeiture and that a bank that parted with its money in good faith should not be held to have acted ultra vires.

Similarly, in Reference case 26 L. Ed. 443, the court held that a loan made on real-estate security was not invalid because the deed of trust was not executed to the bank. The court also held that a corporation's ultra vires action could only be raised by the state and not by the parties involved.

In this case, the lessee made timely payments and the lessor failed to return the deposit as required by the lease. The lessee's actions were therefore not in violation of the lease and the lessor's attempts to terminate the lease were invalid. The court's decision to terminate the lease was therefore incorrect and should be reversed.

Furthermore, the court's decision was also in violation of the public policy of Illinois, which is to deny corporations the power to hold real estate. The lessee's actions were therefore not ultra vires and the court's decision was not supported by the law. In conclusion, the court's decision to terminate the lease was incorrect and should be reversed. The lessee's actions were not in violation of the lease and the lessor's attempts to terminate the lease were invalid. The court's decision was also in violation of the public policy of Illinois and was not supported by the law.

gold_text: Whether the Supreme Court of Illi nois will hold contracts made in violation of section 8 to be absolutely void or merely nonenforeeable, or adopt the rule finally accepted and announced in the two cases heretofore cited (National Bank v. Matthews, 98 U. S. 621, 25 L. Ed. 188; National Bank v. Whitney, 103 U. S. 99, 26 L. Ed. 443), we need not conjecture, for an examination of the record justifies the conclusion that lessee had dissolved in fact, at least in equity, prior to Hoolâ€™s transfer of his interest in the property (and in the so-called corporation) to the lessee. It is true lessee had not proceeded in the manner permitted it under the Illinois statutes to dissolve, but corporations may dissolve in numerous ways. Lessee had ceased to function. It held no corporate meetings. It was without officers and without directors. There were no stockholders available to serve as directors or officers.
