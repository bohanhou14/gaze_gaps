The court's jurisdiction is discretionary, as stated in 285 U.S. 413 and 308 U.S. 1. The court must exercise its discretion wisely, considering factors such as convenience, efficiency, and justice. In this case, the court declines to exercise its jurisdiction over the subject matter, as the controversy has only a slight connection to the United States.

The court's analysis focuses on the substantiality of the contacts of the controversy with the United States. The place of the wrongful act, the allegiance or domicile of the injured party, the allegiance or base of operations of the shipowner, and the law of the forum all have some significance. However, the court gives more weight to the allegiance of the parties and the shipowner's base of operations. In this case, the shipowner's principal place of business is in Greece, and none of the crew members are American citizens. Therefore, the court concludes that the Jones Act does not apply.

The court also considers the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Although the plaintiff has an arguable claim under the Jones Act, the court believes that justice would not be served by exercising jurisdiction over the subject matter. The court declines to exercise its discretion to decline jurisdiction, as the foreign forum is readily accessible and the defendant is willing to defend the action in Greece.

In conclusion, the court declines to exercise its jurisdiction over the subject matter, as the controversy has only a slight connection to the United States. The court also declines to exercise its discretion to decline jurisdiction, as the foreign forum is readily accessible and the defendant is willing to defend the action in Greece. The court's decision is based on the principles stated in 285 U.S. 413 and 308 U.S. 1.
