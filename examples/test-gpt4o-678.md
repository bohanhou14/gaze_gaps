However, as established in the precedent set by Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, the government's authority to deport aliens, particularly those engaged in activities deemed detrimental to national interests, is well within the bounds of constitutional parameters. The Court noted that the United States maintains sovereign power to determine the admissibility and deportability of non-citizens. This principle also resonates in Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, where the Court emphasized that matters of immigration and alien status are firmly within the exclusive domain of Congress.

The Shaars' contention of due process and equal protection violations mirrors an argument that aliens possess a fundamental right to remain in the U.S., a claim which has been consistently refuted. As upheld in Fiallo, 430 U.S. at 806, the legislative power allows for classifications and restrictions that may not accord the same rights to aliens as to citizens. Thus, the IJ and BIA's decisions align with the statutory framework and established legal precedents, demonstrating no abuse of discretion nor constitutional infringement.

Therefore, based on the clear statutory mandate and existing legitimized precedents, we affirm that the BIA's interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(e)(2)(A) was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and the Shaars' failure to depart as required justifies the denial of their reopening petition.

Moreover, Congress has exceedingly broad power over the admission and expulsion of aliens. See Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792, 97 S.Ct. 1473, 1478, 52 L.Ed.2d 50 (1977). In fact, “ ‘over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over’ ” the subject of the admission and expulsion of aliens. Id. at 792, 97 S.Ct. at 1478. Of course, the Shaars were only admitted for a temporary pleasure visit in the first place.
