In considering the dismissal of a lawsuit on grounds of forum non conveniens, courts must weigh the private and public interests involved. In this case, the private interests of the parties include the relative ease of access to sources of proof, the availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses, and other matters affecting the cost, speed, and ease of litigating the suit in a particular forum. Additionally, the public interests to be considered include the administrative burdens imposed on already congested courts by suits that are properly centered elsewhere, and the burden of jury duty on members of a community with no real relation to the dispute.

As noted in reference case 660 F.2d 712, the court must evaluate the enforceability of a judgment rendered by it, weigh relative advantages and obstacles to a fair trial, and determine whether the plaintiff has instituted suit in a particular forum with the intent to vex or harass the defendant. Similarly, in reference case 684 F.2d 232, the court must consider the private and public interests involved, including the relative ease of access to sources of proof, the availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses, and other matters affecting the cost, speed, and ease of litigating the suit in a particular forum.

In this case, the court concludes that the balance of convenience weighs so heavily against trial of the claims in Missouri that the action should be dismissed. The court recognizes that the witnesses are largely in Mexico and that it would be impossible or prohibitively expensive to obtain their attendance in Missouri. Furthermore, the court notes that issues of Mexican law would predominate in the trial, and that the Missouri court's unfamiliarity with Mexican law would present another obstacle to a fair and expeditious trial in Missouri.

Finally, in reference case 701 F.2d 408, the court emphasizes that the doctrine of forum non conveniens leaves much to the discretion of the court. Unless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant, the plaintiff's choice of forum should rarely be disturbed. In this case, the court finds that the defendant has not carried its burden of showing that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to dismiss the suit on forum non conveniens grounds.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the lawsuit on grounds of forum non conveniens is supported by the private and public interests involved, including the relative ease of access to sources of proof, the availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses, and

gold_text: While this Court might dismiss this action subject to conditions that would assure the plaintiff of a fair hearing, Mizokami Bros. of Ariz v. Mobay Chemical Corp., 660 F.2d 712, 719 (8th Cir.1981), neither plaintiff nor defendant has demonstrated the relative advantage in convenience that another forum, compared to this one, would provide. Overseas Programming Companies v. Cinematographische Commerz-Anstalt, 684 F.2d 232, 235 (2d Cir.1982). The selection of a South American country as an alternative forum, although it would afford greater expertise in applying relevant legal principles, would seem to involve considerable hardship and inconvenience for both parties. A British forum might similarly provide some advantages in the construction of relevant law, however, it would impose additional hardships upon defendant, and would raise questions, as would the South American forum, regarding enforceability of a resulting judgment. See American Rice, Inc. v. Arkansas Rice Growers Co-op. Ass’n., 701 F.2d 408, 417 (5th Cir.1983). Where the balance does not tip strongly in favor of an alternative forum it is well-established that the plaintiff’s choice of forum should not be disturbed.
