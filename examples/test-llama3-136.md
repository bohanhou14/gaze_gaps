In the case of Lay v. Amtrak, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the continuing violation doctrine can be applied to a series of related acts of discrimination, including those that occurred outside the statutory limitations period. The court found that the plaintiff, Morgan, had presented sufficient evidence to show that the discriminatory conduct was part of a pattern or practice that continued throughout his employment, including incidents dating back to the beginning of his employment. The court noted that the incidents were not isolated or sporadic, but rather were part of a larger pattern of discriminatory behavior.

The court relied on the precedent set in Fielder v. UAL Corp., 218 F.3d 973 (9th Cir. 2000), which held that the continuing violation doctrine can be applied to a series of related acts of discrimination that occurred over a period of time. The court also cited Draper v. Coeur Rochester, Inc., 147 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir. 1998), which held that a plaintiff can establish a continuing violation by showing a series of related acts of discrimination that occurred over a period of time.

The court further noted that the incidents of discrimination were not discrete or isolated, but rather were part of a larger pattern of discriminatory behavior that included the use of racial slurs, the denial of career opportunities, and the creation of a hostile work environment. The court held that these incidents were sufficiently related to the alleged incidents of discrimination that occurred within the limitations period to trigger the operation of the continuing violation doctrine.

In conclusion, the Lay v. Amtrak case illustrates the application of the continuing violation doctrine in a case involving a series of related acts of discrimination. The court's decision is consistent with the precedent set in Fielder and Draper, and highlights the importance of considering the totality of the circumstances when evaluating a claim of discrimination.

gold_text: In light of our ruling, we need not specifically rule on the evidentiary issues raised by Morgan; however, because these issues may arise again on retrial, we voice a general comment. We note that one of the main issues in a hostile environment or discrimination case is the pervasiveness of the conduct at issue. In this case, the district court excluded significant pieces of information regarding such environment, specifically, portions of Morgan and Fontaine’s testimony and the whole of George’s testimony. This evidence went to the overall environment of the Yard. ' This court has previously recognized that an employer’s conduct tending to demonstrate its general hostility towards a group is both relevant and admissible. See Heyne v. Caruso, 69 F.3d 1475, 1479 (9th Cir.1995). See also Spulak v. K Mart Corp., 894 F.2d 1150, 1156 (10th Cir.1990) (noting that “[a]s a general rule, the testimony of other employees about their treatment by the defendant [employer] is relevant to the issue of the employer’s discriminatory intent.”) We further note that, in returning the verdict, the jury expressed concern about the overall environment at the Yard. The jury commented:
