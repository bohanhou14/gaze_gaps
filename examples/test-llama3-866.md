The case OPINION by Judge Goettel deals with the issue of subject matter jurisdiction and forum non conveniens in a transnational commodities dispute. The plaintiff, Alpa, a Paraguayan corporation, claims that the defendant, ACLI International Commodity Services, Inc., a New York corporation, breached its contract and fiduciary duties, which led to the loss of $850,000. The dispute involves allegations of unauthorized speculative trading, misdirection of trading reports, and conversion of funds from Alpa's account.

The court holds that it has subject matter jurisdiction over the Commodity Exchange Act claims, citing cases such as Fidenas AG v. Compagnie Internationale Pour L'Informatique CII Honeywell Bull S.A. (606 F.2d 5, 2d Cir. 1979) and IIT v. Cornfeld (619 F.2d 909, 2d Cir. 1980). The court finds that the United States is the site of all the activities essential to Alpa's claims, including the opening of the hedge account, the execution of trades, and the maintenance of records.

Regarding the forum non conveniens motion, the court notes that defendant ACLI has not demonstrated the availability of an alternative forum in which the defendant is amenable to process. The court also finds that the private and public interest factors do not favor ACLI's motion, citing cases such as Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert (330 U.S. 501, 67 S.Ct. 839, 91 L.Ed. 1055, 1947) and Full-Sight Contact Lens Corp. v. Soft Lenses, Inc. (466 F.Supp. 71, S.D.N.Y. 1978). The court concludes that the forum selection clause in the contract between Alpa and ACLI does not favor transfer to a foreign forum.

In conclusion, the court denies the defendant's motion to dismiss the federal commodities causes of action and denies the motion to dismiss the entire action on the ground of forum non conveniens. The court finds that it has subject matter jurisdiction over the claims and that the public interest factors favor retention of the case in the United States. The court's decision is consistent with the principles of federal jurisdiction and the doctrine of forum non conveniens, as established in cases such as 407 U.S. 1 and 338 F.2d 759. <answer
