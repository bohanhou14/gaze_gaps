gold_text: The bankruptcy judge’s decision was not in error. The law as to a recusal based upon bias as set forth by defendants is that “[t]he alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.” United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 1710, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966); see also, Berger v. United States, 255 U.S. 22, 41 S.Ct. 230, 65 L.Ed. 481 (1921); In re International Business Machines Corp., 618 F.2d 923 (2d Cir. 1980); United States v. Wolfson, 558 F.2d 59 (2d Cir. 1977); Mitchell v. Sirica, 502 F.2d 375 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 418 U.S. 955, 94 S.Ct. 3232, 41 L.Ed.2d 1177 (1974); Coyne v. Houss, No. 81 Civ. 2198 (E.D.N.Y.1981); Hill v. Town of Islip, No. 80 Civ. 1835 (E.D.N.Y.1981); Lazofsky v. Sommerset Bus Co., 389 F.Supp. 1041 (E.D.N.Y.1975). It is clear from a reading of this record that “[n]one of [the bankruptcy judge’s comments] appear to have arisen from an extrajudicial source or ‘resulted in the formulation of an opinion on the merits not based upon what the judge has learned by [her] participation in the proceedings.’ ” United States v. Bernstein, 533 F.2d 775, 785 (2d Cir. 1976) quoting United States v. Sclafani, 487 F.2d 245, 255 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1023, 94 S.Ct. 445, 38 L.Ed.2d 313 (1973).
