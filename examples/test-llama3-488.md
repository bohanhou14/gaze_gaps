In the case at hand, the court is faced with the issue of whether the defendant's counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal despite the defendant's request. The court must apply the standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), which requires the defendant to show that counsel's acts or omissions "were outside the range of professionally competent assistance." Id. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052.

In this case, the defendant requested his counsel to file a notice of appeal, but the counsel failed to do so. The court finds that this failure was per se ineffective assistance of counsel, citing United States v. Poindexter, 492 F.3d 263, 273 (4th Cir.2007), which held that a criminal defense attorney's failure to file a notice of appeal when requested by his client deprives the defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel.

The court also notes that the defendant's counsel, Mr. Lambert, was not terminated by the defendant at the time of the sentencing hearing, as the Government claimed. Instead, the court finds that Mr. Lambert should have filed the notice of appeal and informed the Court that he had not been retained for the appeal, or determined conclusively that the defendant did not want an appeal to be filed.

The court recommends that the defendant's ยง 2255 motion be granted on the issue that the defendant requested his attorney to file an appeal and counsel ignored or refused this instruction, citing United States v. Peak, 992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir.1993), which held that a criminal defense attorney's failure to file a notice of appeal when requested by his client deprives the defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel.

Furthermore, the court notes that the case at hand is similar to United States v. Schronce, 727 F.2d 91 (4th Cir.1984), which also involved a defendant's request for an appeal that was ignored by his counsel. In that case, the court held that the defendant's counsel was ineffective for failing to file an appeal despite the defendant's request.

In conclusion, the court finds that the defendant's counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal despite
