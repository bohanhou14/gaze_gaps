Based on the cases provided, it is clear that the Supreme Court has established a cumulative effect rule for assessing the duty of the prosecution to disclose evidence favorable to the defense. In Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), the Court held that the prosecution has a duty to disclose evidence that is both favorable to the defense and material to the defense's case.

In the case at hand, the United States has disclosed that officials from the Bureau of Prisons questioned the defendants regarding a bomb threat against a plane departing from the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The defendants deny possessing any knowledge of explosives, and no questions were asked regarding the offenses charged in the indictment.

Given the cumulative effect rule, it is unlikely that the United States' failure to disclose this information would have resulted in a different outcome. The defendants' motion to compel discovery is therefore denied.

The reference case of Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), is also relevant in this context. In Giglio, the Court held that the prosecution's failure to disclose evidence that is favorable to the defense and material to the defense's case can result in a new trial.

In the case at hand, the United States has disclosed that the questioning of the defendants was unrelated to the offenses charged in the indictment. Therefore, the defendants' motion to compel discovery based on Giglio is also denied.

The case of Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995), is also relevant in this context. In Kyles, the Court held that the prosecution has a duty to disclose evidence that is both favorable to the defense and material to the defense's case.

In the case at hand, the United States has disclosed that officials from the Bureau of Prisons questioned the defendants regarding a bomb threat against a plane departing from the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The defendants deny possessing any knowledge of explosives, and no questions were asked regarding the offenses charged in the indictment.

Given the cumulative effect rule, it is unlikely that the United States' failure to disclose this information would have resulted in a different outcome. The defendants' motion to compel discovery is therefore denied.

In conclusion, based on the cases provided, it is clear that the United States has a duty to disclose evidence that is both favorable to the defense and material to the defense's case. However, in this case, the United States has disclosed that the questioning

gold_text: In his motion to compel, Rivera argues in a perfunctory manner that he is entitled to the requested discovery pursuant to Rule 16, Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972), and Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). Rivera fails to establish how information concerning uncharged conduct that has no bearing on the charges the defendants face in this criminal action, and which remains under investigation, is material to the defense pursuant to Rule 16. Because the argument is undeveloped, the Court need not consider its merits. United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).
