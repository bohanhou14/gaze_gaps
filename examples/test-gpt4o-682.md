Unlike the court in *Estate of Finkel v. Donovan*, which upheld the Department of Labor's findings based on the limited impact of imports on the domestic producer’s decline, this case necessitates a more thorough investigation due to the significant role of the foreign customer in Advanced Electronics' sales decline. Thus, merely relying on communications with former representatives without contacting the foreign customer directly leaves questions unanswered. The Department’s conclusion that increased imports did not “contribute importantly” lacks the necessary substantial evidence, as mandated by *Abbott v. Donovan* and established in *Woodrum v. Donovan*, to support a negative determination.

Additionally, as in *389 U.S. 332*, where the Supreme Court disagreed with the Court of Appeals' interpretation of statutory provisions, this court finds Labor’s investigation inadequate in ensuring proper adherence to the statutory requirement of thorough fact-finding. Furthermore, *506 F.2d 174* emphasizes that causation must be direct and substantial. However, failure to explore the interactions with the foreign customer makes it impossible to conclusively affirm that increased imports were not a contributing factor.

For these reasons, the court remands the case back to the Department to conduct a comprehensive investigation that includes contacting the foreign customer to determine if imports of like articles influenced the loss of business experienced by Advanced Electronics.

gold_text: Estate of Finkel does not support defendant’s argument that “Labor was not obligated to investigate the American supplier’s imports because such imports, if they existed, would be insufficient to show the required connection between imports and AEI’s workers’ separation.” See Def.’s Mem. in Opp’n 6. Labor’s valid findings in this case (ie., those supported by substantial evidence), taken together, are not sufficient to rule out imports as an important causative factor. In Estate of Finkel, the Court of International Trade was not persuaded by plaintiffs’ argument that Labor should have considered (1) those customers who decreased purchases from the domestic producer and switched to imports, or to other domestic sources who had lowered their prices to compete with imports, and (2) the domestic producer’s inability to attract new customers due to increasing import penetration. Estate of Finkel, 9 CIT at 382-83, 614 F.Supp. at 1251-52. Plaintiffs argument in Estate of Finkel concerning customers who switched to imports was refuted by Labor’s finding that such switching was relatively insignificant. See id. at 383, 614 F.Supp. at 1252. The effect of domestic sources who lowered their prices to compete with imports and the effect of import penetration on the producer’s inability to attract new customers, both of which were characterized as indirect effects in the opinion in Estate of Finkel, are not analogous to what plaintiffs are alleging in this case. See id. at 382-83, 614 F.Supp. at 1251-52. Plaintiffs are alleging, in essence, that imports into the United States, after re-exportation, could have displaced the printed circuit boards the Company previously supplied to the foreign customer and that Labor’s investigation was inadequate because it did not consider this possibility. Pis.’ Remand Resp. 2-3. The court declines to adopt a construction of the Act under which Labor need never consider, in any circumstances, whether increased imports of a like or directly competitive article contributed importantly to a plaintiffs separation by causing the employer to lose business from a customer outside of the United States. Moreover, the Department has not indicated that it based its own decision on such a construction. Any construction of the Act must consider the remedial purpose of this statute and interpret its provisions so as to effectuate the statutory purpose. Woodrum, 5 CIT at 198, 564 F.Supp. at 832 (“It is true ... that the remedial nature of the [TAA] statute requires a liberal construction.”) (citing United Shoe Workers of Am. v. Bedell, 506 F.2d 174, 187 (D.C.Cir.1974)), af'd sub nom. Woodrum v. United States, 737 F.2d at 1576; see also Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336, 88 S.Ct. 548, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967) (stating that the Supreme Court is “guided by the familiar canon of statutory construction that remedial legislation should be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes”).
