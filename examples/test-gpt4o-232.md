In arguing the Fourth Amendment violation, appellants' lack of standing is similar to the situation in Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128. In Rakas, the petitioners lacked a proprietary interest in the vehicle and therefore could not claim an expectation of privacy. Similarly, Shabazz and Parker did not own the car or assert ownership of the contraband. Thus, their claim to suppress the evidence fails on the same standing grounds.

Regarding the consent to search, a parallel can be drawn to the decision in United States v. Lee, 898 F.2d 1034, where consent given by those in control of the rented truck was deemed valid. Here, Parker, who represented himself as the car's owner, voluntarily gave both oral and written consent. The district court correctly analyzed the voluntariness under the standards set by Lee, finding no coercive police procedures and determining that Parker believed no incriminating evidence would be found, thus upholding the search's legality.

The conviction’s sufficiency parallels rulings where knowing possession can be inferred from inconsistent statements and suspicious behavior during a traffic stop, adequately supported by the fresh concealment of drugs in the car’s air conditioning vent and the presence of the tools used.

Consequently, based on a thorough comparison with the referenced cases, the trial court rightly denied the motion to suppress evidence.

gold_text: . The government initially challenged the standing of Shabazz, who was driving the car but made no claim to be its owner, to challenge the search as violative of the Fourth Amendment. The district court ruled that Shabazz had the requisite standing. As the government does not raise the issue of standing on appeal, and in light of our affirmance of the district court's denial of the motion to suppress, we do not address the district court's ruling in this respect. Cf. Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978) (passengers in a car driven by its owner did not have standing to raise the Fourth Amendment); United States v. Lee, 898 F.2d 1034 (5th Cir.1990), cert. denied, - U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1057, 122 L.Ed.2d 363 (1993) (driver of and passenger in a truck rented by a third party and being operated at third party’s behest have standing to raise the Fourth Amendment).
