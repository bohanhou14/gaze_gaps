IV.

Given that the district court’s order did not address the merits of the inmates' remaining claims or the officials' defense of qualified immunity for those claims, we must remand for further proceedings. In doing so, we emphasize that summary judgment is appropriate when there is no dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986) (see also 991 F.2d 435).

This court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal of issues not decided by the district court, such as those involving qualified immunity for claims other than due process (see 992 F.2d 791). This principle further necessitates a remand for the district court to determine whether any genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the inmates' claims of denial of access to law libraries, courts, religious services, educational programs, and work opportunities, as well as the allegations of racial motivation and failure to protect.

Therefore, we affirm the denial of summary judgment regarding Payne and Moore's due process claims but reverse and remand the case for consideration of the remaining claims and associated qualified immunity defenses.

In conclusion, we reverse the partial summary judgment in favor of Payne, Moore, and McGee on their due process claims and grant summary judgment in favor of the officials concerning McGee's due process claims. We remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion, particularly to address the unresolved claims of the inmates.

gold_text: When the order appealed from does not decide the issue of qualified immunity, this court lacks jurisdiction to decide it. Moutray v. Butts, 985 F.2d 426, 427 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 69, 126 L.Ed.2d 38 (1993); Shannon v. White, 992 F.2d 791, 792-93 (8th Cir.1993). In Moutray, we held that we lacked jurisdiction because the district court’s order dealt with summary judgment only as to the merits and did not discuss qualified immunity. 985 F.2d at 427. Similarly, in Shannon, we held that we lacked jurisdiction where the district court adopted two magistrate judge’s reports without comment and neither report discussed qualified immunity. 992 F.2d at 792-93. Although we determined that we had jurisdiction in Krueger v. Fuhr, 991 F.2d 435, 438 n. 2 (8th Cir.1993), the district court there denied the motion for summary judgment, but at least noted that the qualified immunity defense had been argued. Here, the district court did not discuss the qualified immunity defense as to the inmates’ additional claims. As there is no ruling as to qualified immunity on these issues, we have no basis for reaching the merits. We must, therefore, remand to the district court for further proceedings.
