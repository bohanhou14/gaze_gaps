In this case, the United States brought a civil action against M.C.C. of Florida, Inc. and Michael Construction Co. for violating the River and Harbor Act of 1899 and the Clean Water Act. M.C.C. argued that it was entitled to a jury trial, citing the Seventh Amendment's right to trial by jury. However, the district court held that M.C.C. was not entitled to a jury trial because the case involved both legal and equitable claims.

The Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to trial by jury for cases at common law, but it does not apply to cases that involve equitable claims. In Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 369 U.S. 469 (1962), the Supreme Court held that where both legal and equitable issues are presented in a single case, a jury trial is not available for the legal issues unless "under the most imperative circumstances, circumstances which in view of the flexible procedures of the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate, can the right to a jury-trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims." Id. at 477.

In this case, the district court found that M.C.C. had violated the River and Harbor Act and the Clean Water Act, and it issued a cease and desist order. M.C.C. argued that the cease and desist order was an equitable remedy, and therefore, it was not entitled to a jury trial. The district court agreed, holding that the case involved both legal and equitable claims and that a jury trial was not available.

The court's decision was consistent with the Supreme Court's holding in Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, which emphasized the importance of considering the flexible procedures of the Federal Rules in determining whether a jury trial is available in a case that involves both legal and equitable claims. See also Fleitmann v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co., 240 U.S. 27, 29 (1916).

The decision in this case was also consistent with the Supreme Court's holding in Walter E. Hoffman, 359 U.S. 500 (1959), which emphasized the importance of considering the legislative history of the Clean Water Act in determining whether a particular activity constitutes a "discharge of a pollutant" under the Act.

In conclusion, the district court's decision denying M.C.C.'s request for a jury trial was consistent with the Supreme Court's holdings in Beacon Theat

gold_text: M.C.C. contends that it was entitled to a jury trial and that the district court therefore erred in striking its demand for one. The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution provides that in “Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.” U.S. Const. Amend. VII. The Supreme Court has held that it is “the nature of the issue to be tried rather than the character of the overall action” that is determinative. Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 538, 90 S.Ct. 733, 738, 24 L.Ed.2d 729 (1970). When there are both legal and equitable issues present, then the right to a jury trial as to the legal issues remains. Dairy Queen v. Wood, 369 U.S. 469, 82 S.Ct. 894, 8 L.Ed.2d 44 (1962); Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959). Therefore, we must examine whether any of the issues were legal in nature.
