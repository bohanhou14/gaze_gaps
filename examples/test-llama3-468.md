The case at hand concerns the denial of a Franks hearing by the district court. The defendant, Richard Lee Cone, argued that a report submitted with a search warrant application omitted facts that would have affected the determination of probable cause. The report failed to mention that the informant, Avery Hollrah, was motivated by a promise of favorable treatment in exchange for his cooperation.

In evaluating whether the district court abused its discretion, we must consider whether the omitted facts were material and whether the affidavit, if supplemented by the omitted information, could not support a finding of probable cause. See United States v. Reinholz, 245 F.3d 765, 774 (8th Cir.2001). In this case, the omitted facts were not material, as the affidavit, even with the omitted information, would still have supported a finding of probable cause. See United States v. Wajda, 810 F.2d 754, 759 (8th Cir.1987).

The court correctly concluded that the affidavit, considered as a whole, was sufficient to support a finding of probable cause. See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). The informant's information was at least partially corroborated, and attacks upon credibility and reliability were not crucial to the finding of probable cause. See United States v. Humphreys, 982 F.2d 254, 258-59 (8th Cir.1992).

In conclusion, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Franks hearing. The case is consistent with the principles outlined in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), and the reference cases cited above. The affidavit, considered as a whole, was sufficient to support a finding of probable cause, and the omitted facts were not material.

gold_text: That the affidavit omitted the promise of favorable treatment for Avery did not obscure a defect in the officer’s probable-cause submission. Informants may be motivated to lie when charges are pending against them, United States v. Ketzeback, 358 F.3d 987, 991 (8th Cir.2004), and we may assume that the prospect of charges against the child of an informant could have a similar effect. But we have “repeatedly rejected any blanket conclusion” that pending charges or cooperation with investigators make an informant’s statements “so suspect that it necessarily viti ates probable cause.” Id. The magistrate was informed that Hollrah received favorable consideration for his cooperation against Cone, and additional information about consideration for Avery would have been largely cumulative. That Hollrah was reluctant to include his admission about seeing additional marijuana at Cone’s home also does not fatally undermine the credibility of the submission, for Hollrah hesitated because he was concerned about implicating himself in additional criminal activity. Statements against interest typically support an inference of reliability, United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 583, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971); United States v. Reivich, 793 F.2d 957, 959 (8th Cir.1986), so Hollrah’s reticence under the circumstances suggests reliability. Nor does Zane’s writing of the affidavit weaken its substance, especially given video evidence that Zane accepted Hollrah’s direction and made corrections when requested.
