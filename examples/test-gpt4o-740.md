The principles established in relevant case law further support this Court's findings. In reference to 389 F.2d 159, it is clear that the General Insurance Company's failure to act in good faith and continued issuance of bonds despite defaults prejudiced the rights of the involved parties, akin to the shipowner and stevedore's negligence herein.

Moreover, the substantial breach versus insubstantial breach doctrine as articulated in 333 F.2d 89 aligns with this case. The shipowner’s and stevedore’s breaches, although contributory, were pivotal in causing the injury to Jackson; nonetheless, the stevedore’s breach rose to the level of substantial, invoking their duty to indemnify.

Additionally, the concept of misrepresentation and reliance in forming contracts from 262 F.2d 526 underscores the necessity for truthful communication impacting obligations, relevant to the shipowner and stevedore's duties to provide safe equipment and working conditions, respectively.

Furthermore, as noted in 161 F.2d 152 with the principle of de minimis non curat lex, minor discrepancies do not void overall contractual obligations; similarly, minor beneficial adjustments in winch operations do not alleviate the fundamental breach by failing to remediate unsafe conditions adequately.

In sum, both parties' negligence and breach of implied warranties necessitate the conclusion of indemnification by the stevedore, with no substantial contributory negligence by the plaintiff, as their primary duty to ensure safety was paramount.
