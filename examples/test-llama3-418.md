The legal case presented in the reference article is a class action lawsuit filed by Jeffrey Gammon against GC Services Limited Partnership (GC Services) under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Gammon claims that GC Services’ standard debt collection letter violates the FDCPA by implying that the company is affiliated with the government. The court is asked to determine whether the case can be certified as a class action under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

In order to certify a class action, the court must determine whether the requirements of Rule 23(a) are met. The requirements include numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. The court finds that these requirements are satisfied, as the class is numerous, the claims have common issues, the claims are typical of the class, and the named plaintiff is an adequate representative. (Reference: 102 F.R.D. 944)

The court must also determine whether the case satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). The court finds that GC Services has acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, and thus, declaratory relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate. The court notes that declaratory judgment is an integral part of the relief for the entire class, and if GC Services prevails on the issue of liability, statutory damages would flow directly from the declaratory judgment. (Reference: 713 F.2d 225)

The court also addresses GC Services’ argument that the class should not be certified because individual class members would forego up to $1,000 in statutory damages available to individual litigants under the FDCPA. The court finds that the FDCPA contemplates class actions for statutory damages, and even absent such a provision, the fact that class members would receive only minimal damages does not necessarily suffice to render an action inappropriate for class certification. (Reference: 963 F.2d 1013)

In conclusion, the court certifies the class action under Rule 23(b)(2) and grants Gammon’s motion for class certification. The certified class consists of all persons from whom GC Services has attempted to collect debts since August 31, 1992. (Reference: 713 F.2d 225)

gold_text: . The Court's own independent review of these criteria also finds the numerosity, commonality and typicality prerequisites to be satisfied by the plaintiff class. First, the proposed class consists of four million individuals, and thus is clearly "so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable." Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(1). Second, the fact that GC Services sent the same standard debt collection letter to all members of the proposed class suffices to provide a "common nucleus of operative fact,” see Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir.1992) (citing Franklin v. City of Chicago, 102 F.R.D. 944, 949-50 (N.D.Ill. 1984)), thereby satisfying Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality requirement. Third, the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3) is satisfied because Gammon’s claim rests on the theory that GC Services' standard debt collection letter violates the FDCPA, and thus arises "from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and [is] based on the same legal theory.” De La Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir.1983) (quoting H. Newberg, Class Actions § 115(b) at 185 (1977)).
