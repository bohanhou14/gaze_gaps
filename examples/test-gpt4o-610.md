To establish a deprivation of a liberty interest, plaintiffs must meet specific criteria. According to Roth, a liberty interest is implicated when stigmatizing statements are made in conjunction with the plaintiff's termination from employment (123 F.3d 404). Additionally, a mere charge of inadequate performance or general absenteeism does not equate to a liberty deprivation (882 F.2d 200). In this case, DPS’s statements about absenteeism did not identify any specific individuals nor make public accusations against named plaintiffs that might seriously damage their standing in the community or foreclose future employment opportunities (Roth, 408 U.S. at 573).

The plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer’s statements imposed a "stigma or other disability that [would] foreclose[ ] his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities" (123 F.3d 404). Here, plaintiffs have not shown DPS’s asserted absenteeism accusations reached such a level of stigmatization. Therefore, the district court was correct in determining plaintiffs' allegations did not rise to a level that necessitated a name-clearing hearing (882 F.2d 200).

Accordingly, plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege a constitutional deprivation of their liberty interests as required under established precedents. Thus, the claims under Count II fail as a matter of law.

Boris, 882 F.2d 200, 205 n. 8 (6th Cir.1989).(3) The statements must be made public. Ludwig, 123 F.3d at 410.(4) The plaintiff must claim that the charges made against him were false. Id.
