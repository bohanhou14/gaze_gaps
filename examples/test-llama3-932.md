ORDER GRANTING “MOTION FOR ALLOWANCE AND PAYMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIM" OF DUN-HILL OF SOUTH TULSA, INC.

This is a core proceeding under 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(A), (B), 11 U.S.C. § 503(b). The facts and issues may be summarized as follows. Dunhill of South Tulsa, Inc. ("Dunhill") is an employment agency which located a "loan closer" who was hired by First Security Mortgage Company ("First Security"). First Security filed a voluntary petition for relief under 11 U.S.C. Chapter 11 in this Court. The Trustee, Patrick J. Malloy III, was appointed to oversee First Security's case and estate.

The issue before this Court is whether Dunhill's fee for locating the loan closer is an administrative expense entitled to priority under 11 U.S.C. § 503(b)(1)(A). The Trustee argues that since the loan closer did not complete her four-month term, the fee should be reduced in proportion to the actual time spent by the loan closer. However, this Court finds that Dunhill's services conferred a signal benefit on this estate, prospectively at least, and there is no evidence that the fee charged for such services is excessive.

In relevant case law, the Court notes that "administrative priority is granted to post-petition expenses so that third parties will be moved to provide the goods and services necessary for a successful reorganization," In re Jartran, Inc., 732 F.2d 584, 588 (7th Circ.1984). The Court also recognizes that "the policy of the priority [is] to further the success of the reorganization," In re Mammoth Mart, Inc., 536 F.2d 950, 954 (1st Circ.1976).

As stated in In re Amarex, Inc., 853 F.2d 1526, 1531 (10th Circ.1988), "the court may award compensation different from the compensation provided under [11 U.S.C.] § 327(a)... if such terms and conditions prove to have been improvident in light of developments not capable of being anticipated at the time of the fixing of such terms and conditions." The Court finds that Dunhill's fee is reasonable and that the services performed by Dunhill were necessary for the successful

gold_text: Some courts have purported to deny all compensation, no matter how valuable the services rendered or how innocent the infraction, when court approval was not obtained before the employment commenced or the services were rendered; see In re Windsor Communications Group, Inc., 54 B.R. 844 (B.C., E.D.Penn.1985). 11 U.S.C. § 330(a), read literally, indicates that compensation is owing only to one who is “employed” under § 327; and § 327(a) makes it clear that employment must be approved at some time by the Court; but none of the statutes here involved provide in so many words that compensation is owing only where the Court’s approval has been given in advance of employment. Automatic disallowance of any fee no matter what the circumstances is not only uncalled-for by the statutory language but unjustifiable in equity and insupportable as a matter of policy. In equity, it is apparent that such a rule tends to confer an unjust enrichment on the estate which has received valuable services without having to pay anything for them, and inflicts a substantial penalty for a “wrong” that may be merely technical in nature, innocent in intention, and otherwise harmless in effect. A court of equity is seldom justified in disregarding quantum meruit. As a matter of policy, it is apparent that so ferocious a penalty goes beyond what is needed to guard against the occasional “officious intermeddler or ... gratuitous volunteer,” 2 Collier on Bankruptcy (15th ed. 1990) ¶ 327.02 p. 327-7, and see In re King Electric Co., Inc., 19 B.R. 660 (E.D.Va.1982); and will make a discreet provider of services avoid a bankruptcy case as he would avoid a minefield, thereby defeating the underlying policy of encouraging post-petition support for entities attempting to reorganize. The rule of automatic, invariable and total forfeiture of fee is made all the more inappropriate in cases such as the present one by the difficulty of deciding who is or is not a “professional person” subject to § 327(a) — this is a terrible thing to do to one who has given good service in good faith merely because his opinion on an obscure and difficult point of law differs from that of the judge,. This Court is under the impression that bankruptcy is essentially an exercise in intelligent equity, albeit regularized by Congressional enactments, Bank of Marin v. England, 385 U.S. 99, 87 S.Ct. 274, 17 L.Ed.2d 197 (1966); Securities & Exchange Comm. v. United States Realty & Improvement Co., 310 U.S. 434, 60 S.Ct. 1044, 84 L.Ed. 1293 (1940); Pepper v. Litton, 308 U.S. 295, 60 S.Ct. 238, 84 L.Ed. 281 (1939). There is no place in such a scheme for so savage a rule.
