The issue of whether a civil forfeiture of drug proceeds constitutes punishment for double jeopardy purposes has been a topic of debate among the circuit courts. The Supreme Court has not explicitly addressed this issue, leaving it to the circuit courts to develop their own approaches.

The Ninth Circuit has taken the approach that a civil forfeiture of drug proceeds under 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(6) constitutes punishment for double jeopardy purposes, citing United States v. $405,089.23 United States Currency, 33 F.3d 1210 (9th Cir.1994). This approach is based on the reasoning that the forfeiture of drug proceeds is a form of punishment, as it deprives the owner of the property and can be used to fund government programs.

On the other hand, the Fifth Circuit has taken a more narrow approach, holding that the forfeiture of drug proceeds is not punishment, but rather a remedial sanction. This approach is based on the reasoning that the forfeiture of drug proceeds is a means of recovering the proceeds of illegal activity, and is not intended to punish the owner of the property.

The Sixth Circuit has also taken a similar approach, holding that the forfeiture of drug proceeds is not punishment, but rather a remedial sanction. This approach is based on the reasoning that the forfeiture of drug proceeds is a means of recovering the proceeds of illegal activity, and is not intended to punish the owner of the property.

In United States v. Escobar, 59 F.3d 974 (1st Cir.1995), the court held that the civil forfeiture of drug proceeds is a remedial sanction, and not punishment. The court reasoned that the forfeiture of drug proceeds is a means of recovering the proceeds of illegal activity, and is not intended to punish the owner of the property.

In United States v. One Parcel of Real Property, Located at 9638 Chicago Heights, St. Louis, Mo., 27 F.3d 327, 330 (8th Cir.1994), the court held that the government’s failure to provide notice and hearing before seizing the property violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

In United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, et al., — U.S. — 114 S.Ct. 492, 126 L.Ed.2d 490 (1993), the Supreme Court held that absent exigent circumstances, the government could not seize real property in a civil forfeiture proceeding without aff

gold_text: On the other hand, the Second, Third, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuits are of the view that the illegal seizure does not, standing alone, require that the property be immune from forfeiture. See United States v. Real Property Located In El Dorado, 59 F.3d 974 (9th Cir.1995); United States v. All Assets and Equip. of West Side Bldg., 58 F.3d 1181, 1193 (7th Cir.1995); United States v. 51 Pieces of Real Property Roswell, N.M., 17 F.3d 1306 (10th Cir.1994); United States v. Premises Known as RR # 1, 14 F.3d 864, 869 n. 5 (3rd Cir.1994); United States v. Premises and Real Property at 4492 South Livonia Rd., 889 F.2d 1258, 1265-66 (2nd Cir.1989). Under this view, the government must remit any rents or profits accrued during the illegal seizure of the property. The recent Ninth Circuit Court case adds that an award of rent may not be the sole relief available, that claimants might also be entitled to damages for loss of use and enjoyment of the properties caused by the illegal seizure. United States v. Real Property Located In El Dorado, supra. The Tenth Circuit also concluded that any constitutional harm could be remedied by the suppression of any evidence gained through the illegal seizure. 51 Pieces of Real Property, 17 F.3d at 1316.
