The case at hand presents a complex scenario where the plaintiff is seeking damages for the alleged breach of a contract of agency and open account. The plaintiff claims that the defendants, John S. Aldehoff & Co., wrongfully terminated the contract and caused the plaintiff to lose business in the states of Texas and Oklahoma. The defendants, on the other hand, argue that the plaintiff breached the contract by failing to provide them with necessary information and by directing the local agents to report to Hines Bros. instead of them.

The court must consider the instructions given to the jury, including the instruction that "if the jury find from the evidence that the plaintiffs were in good faith endeavoring to carry out and perform said contract according to its terms, and the defendant wantonly or carelessly and negligently interfered with and hindered and prevented the plaintiffs in such performance to such an extent as to render the performance of it difficult, and greatly decrease the profits which the plaintiffs would otherwise have made, then and in such case such interference was unauthorized and illegal and would have justified the plaintiffs in abandoning the contract, and would have entitled them to recover such damages as they actually suffered by being hindered and prevented from performing such contract." (Reference case 14 S. Ct. 876)

The court must also consider the evidence presented, including the letters and telegrams exchanged between the parties. The defendants' argument that the plaintiff's breach of the contract was a material breach that justified termination of the contract is supported by the evidence. The court must determine whether the plaintiff's failure to provide necessary information and direction to the local agents was a material breach that justified termination of the contract.

In this case, the court may also consider the principle that a party cannot rescind a contract and at the same time recover damages for non-performance, as stated in Reference case 38 L. Ed. 814. The court must carefully consider the evidence and the instructions given to the jury to make a determination on the merits of the case.

In conclusion, the court must carefully consider the evidence and the instructions given to the jury to make a determination on the merits of the case. The court must determine whether the plaintiff's breach of the contract was a material breach that justified termination of the contract and whether the defendants' actions were authorized and legal. The court must also consider the principle that a party cannot rescind a contract and at the same time recover damages for non-performance.
