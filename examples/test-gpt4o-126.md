In recalculating the fees, the district court must follow established guidelines for determining and adjusting attorney’s fees. The calculation of the “lodestar” is central, computed by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by a reasonable hourly rate. As cited in Morales v. City of San Rafael, 96 F.3d 359, 363 (9th Cir. 1996) and Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), the court must ensure that any adjustments to the lodestar figure are not arbitrary but rather based on recognized factors such as the complexity of the case and the results obtained.

Moreover, any percentage reductions, such as those applied to Ferland’s fee request, require clear reasoning and explanation. The district court must avoid the impermissible “double-counting” of inefficiencies, as emphasized in Cunningham v. County of Los Angeles, 879 F.2d 481 (9th Cir. 1988) and maintain transparency in its rationale. The decision should also incorporate applicable factors from Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., 526 F.2d 67, ensuring that all relevant considerations are balanced appropriately.

Thus, the district court should carefully reevaluate the hours compensable, justifying any reductions clearly, as seen in Van Gerwen v. Guarantee Mutual Life, 214 F.3d 1041, to avoid an abuse of discretion. This ensures that the determination of the fee award is both fair and adequately supported by the record.

City of San Rafael, 96 F.3d 359, 363 (9th Cir.1996). "The lodestar’ is calculated by multiplying the number of hours the prevailing parly reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate.” Morales, 96 F.3d at 363. Although in most cases, the lodestar figure is presumptively a reasonable fee award, the district court may, if circumstances warrant, adjust the lodestar to account for other factors which are not subsumed within it. See, e.g., Van Gerwen v. Guarantee Mut. Life Co., 214 F.3d 1041, 1046 (9th Cir.2000); see also Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., 526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir.1975) (enumerating factors district courts may consider in determining fee awards).
