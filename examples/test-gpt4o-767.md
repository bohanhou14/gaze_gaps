In this case, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant misappropriated their trade secrets, which consist of the proprietary information regarding their IP addresses and email system configurations. Defendant contends that Plaintiffs have failed to describe their trade secrets with sufficient particularity, thereby failing to differentiate them from general knowledge within the industry.

Under California law, as referenced in Cal. Civil Code § 3426.1(d), a trade secret must derive independent economic value from not being generally known and must be subject to efforts to maintain its secrecy. This principle was underscored in Universal Analytics v. MacNeal-Schwendler Corp., 914 F.2d 1256, where the court emphasized that plaintiffs must clearly identify what constitutes the trade secret and must show that the information is not a matter of general knowledge in the trade.

In this context, the Plaintiffs have failed to meet these criteria. As articulated in MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511, the burden lies with the Plaintiffs to precisely identify their trade secrets. However, the Plaintiffs here provided vague descriptions rather than the precise numerical "dimensions and tolerances" necessary to establish the existence of a trade secret. This parallels the finding in Universal Analytics, 707 F.Supp. 1170, affirmed in 914 F.2d 1256, where the court required a detailed and particular delineation of trade secrets.

Consequently, following the precedent in 152 F.3d 1161, the Plaintiffs' inability to offer specific, separate, and clear descriptions of their trade secrets fails to meet the necessary legal standard. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on the trade secrets claim is GRANTED.

gold_text: The trade secret’s subject matter must be described with “sufficient particularity to separate it from matters of general knowledge in the trade or of special knowledge of those persons ... skilled in the trade.” Imax Corp. v. Cinema Technologies, Inc., 152 F.3d 1161, 1164-1165 (9th Cir.1998) (quoting Universal Analytics v. MacNeal-Schwendler Corp., 707 F.Supp. 1170, 1177 (C.D.Cal.1989), aff'd, 914 F.2d 1256 (9th Cir.1990)). The trade secret also has to be described with sufficient particularity “to permit the defendant to ascertain at least the boundaries within which the secret lies.” Diodes, Inc. v. Franzen, 260 Cal.App.2d 244, 67 Cal.Rptr. 19 (1968), accord Imax Corp., 152 F.3d at 1163-64.
