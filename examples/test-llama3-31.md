The appeal and cross-appeal in this bankruptcy case involve a Chapter 7 trustee’s right to recover allegedly preferential and unauthorized payments made by the debtor in possession under Chapter 11 prior to conversion of the case to a Chapter 7 proceeding. The trustee seeks to recover the pre-petition payments, post-petition payments, and payments made under the confirmed plan.

In this case, the bankruptcy court determined that the trustee failed to show that the bank received more than it would have received if the case were a Chapter 7 case and the transfer had not been made, and thus, the payments were not recoverable under § 547(b). The trustee also sought to recover the post-confirmation payments, but the bankruptcy court determined that these payments were authorized and not recoverable under § 549(a).

On appeal, the trustee argues that the confirmation of a plan that treats a debt as secured provides authorization for so treating it when in fact the security interest for the debt has not been perfected. However, the court holds that the confirmation of a plan has the effect of a judgment by the district court and res judicata principles bar relitigation of any issues raised or that could have been raised in the confirmation proceedings. The court also notes that the parties most affected by the plan — the unsecured creditors — accepted the plan.

Furthermore, the trustee seeks to recover the post-confirmation payments under § 502(j), but the court holds that the trustee is not entitled to recover the post-confirmation payments on the basis of § 502(j), as it was not intended to provide an avenue of attack on the finality of a binding order of confirmation. The court also notes that the trustee’s right to recover is limited to transfers of estate property and that the confirmation of a plan revests the property of the estate in the debtor.

In conclusion, the court affirms the district court’s judgment and holds that the trustee is not entitled to recover the pre-petition payments, post-petition payments, and payments made under the confirmed plan. (Refer to 801 F.2d 819, 801 F.2d 819, 590 F.2d 470)

gold_text: The bankruptcy court also found that this court had clarified the § 547(b)(5) requirement in In re Tenna Corp., 801 F.2d 819 (6th Cir.1986), decided after trial but before the bankruptcy court’s ruling. A change in legal standards is a proper ground for reopening proof. Skehan v. Board of Trustees of Bloomsburg State College, 590 F.2d 470, 479 (3rd Cir.1978). We do not believe it was necessary to rely on In re Tenna in order to reopen the evidence in this case. Our decision in that case merely clarified the time at which the “more than” determination is to be made; the requirement that such a determination must be made was not an issue. Neverthe less, reopening for the purpose of making a more complete record was not an abuse of discretion. We also agree with the district court’s conclusion that the bank was not prejudiced by the reopening.
