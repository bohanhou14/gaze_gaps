**Generation:**

The entire examination of the Tax Court's decision in this case aligns with the principle of administrative finality emphasized in **320 U.S. 489**. As stated, the Tax Court’s decisions are characterized by substantial uniformity and its members are adept in handling complex tax matters due to their continuous exposure and specialized staffing. This backdrop explains why the Tax Court’s finding, that the payments to Mrs. Thomas were not ordinary and necessary business expenses, remains steadfast. 

Similarly, **326 U.S. 521** underscores that the Tax Court's independence and the specialized nature of their function underscore the high degree of deference given to their decisions. This was evident when the Tax Court dismissed the rehearing motion, confirming that the petitioner was under no legal obligation to pay the royalties and acknowledging no exceptional business necessity.

Thus, despite the state court's decision in favor of Mrs. Thomas under Pennsylvania law, the Tax Court's findings, rooted in federal tax law, are not undermined. This distinction ensures that federal tax principles prevail in determining what constitutes allowable business expenses, as reinforced by the precedence noted in **320 U.S. 489** and **326 U.S. 521**.

gold_text: As we see it the pending issue is directly within the scope of the Tower and Lus-thaus opinions. In Tower, the Supreme Court accepted the possibility of the Michigan law upholding the stock transfer and thus validating Mrs. Tower’s title to the stock but the Court said in effect that such final state conclusion could not govern the question of the federal taxability of the stock to the husband. In Lusthaus the cloak of legal respectability under Pennsylvania law could not be recognized for income tax purposes. Here the Tax Court heard and for all practical purposes reheard the matter and decided the mixed questions of law and fact which arose. Later on, in a suit started after the Tax Court opinions had been filed, the state court upheld the royalty contract on facts agreed between the parties. That decision cannot hamper “the effective enforcement of a valid federal tax levied against earned income.” And the decision of the Tax Court under all the circumstances and predicated on the mixed questions of law and fact involved is final. Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U.S. 489, 64 S.Ct. 239, 88 L.Ed. 248; John Kelley v. Commissioner, 326 U.S. 521, 66 S.Ct. 299.
