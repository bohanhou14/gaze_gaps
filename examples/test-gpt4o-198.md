Regarding the district court’s discovery rulings, we review for an abuse of discretion. Pippinger v. Rubin, 129 F.3d 519, 533 (10th Cir.1997). In Case No. 221 F.3d 1160, it was noted that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to compel discovery when it provided ample discovery relevant to the case. Here, the district court denied plaintiff’s motion to compel discovery of all building permits denied over four years due to oppressiveness and lack of relevance. Given the broad discretion courts have over discovery matters, as affirmed in 221 F.3d 1160 and 196 F.3d 1292, we find no abuse of discretion in this denial.

We also review the denial of summary judgment de novo, and upon review, we conclude that plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence of race discrimination. As established in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986), summary judgment is appropriate where the nonmoving party fails to establish an essential element of their case with the requisite evidence. Without concrete evidence corroborating plaintiff’s allegations of differential treatment based on race, the grant of summary judgment by the district court is affirmed.

Therefore, in line with 196 F.3d 1292 and 221 F.3d 1160, we affirm the district court's rulings in their entirety.

gold_text: Plaintiff also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to compel defendants to produce all building permits that had been denied during the previous four years. We review discovery rulings, including the denial of a motion to compel discovery, for an abuse of discretion. Soma Med. Int’l v. Standard Chartered Bank, 196 F.3d 1292, 1300 (10th Cir.1999). In this case, the only building permit denials relevant to plaintiffs claims are those relating to property that had been the subject of three years’ of abatement proceedings before the permit was requested. As plaintiff made no attempt to narrow his discovery request, we conclude the district court did not err in denying his motion to compel. The district court was not required to permit plaintiff to engage in a “fishing expedition” in the hope of supporting his claim. See Munoz v. St. Mary-Corwin Hosp., 221 F.3d 1160, 1169 (10th Cir.2000).
