The cases of Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company v. Mottley (219 U.S. 467, 31 Sup. Ct. 265, 55 L.Ed. -) and Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville Railroad Company v. United States (219 U.S. 486, 31 Sup. Ct. 272, 55 L.Ed. -) support the proposition that exact equality of transportation rates is necessary. In Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fé Railway Company v. United States (C. C. A.) 170 Fed. 256, 95 C. C. A. 452, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a reduction in rate, even if represented by a charge of 5 cents, constitutes a concession prohibited by statute. Similarly, in Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company v. United States (157 Fed. 830, 85 C. C. A. 194), the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit ruled that the want of consciousness of evil intent does not excuse an overt act made criminal by law.

In the instant case, the appellants, as receivers of the Seaboard Air Line Railway Company, were indicted for violating section 1 of the Elkins Act (49 U.S.C.A. § 41) by failing to observe their published tariffs in connection with a shipment of scrap iron from Goldsboro, N. C. to Wilmington, N. C. The evidence showed that the shipment was intended from its inception as a movement in foreign commerce.

The Supreme Court in Texas & N. O. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co. (227 U.S. 111, 33 S.Ct. 229, 57 L.Ed. 442) held that the fact that a foreign destination was intended at the time of shipment was determinative, and that the character of the shipment as being one in foreign commerce was not affected by the fact that it was shipped to the exporter under an order notify bill of lading or that the original shipper had no further control over it after its arrival at the port of Sabine. Similarly, in United States v. Erie R. Co. (280 U.S. 98, 50 S.Ct. 51, 52, 74 L.Ed. 187), the court held that the movement was in fact a part of foreign commerce.
