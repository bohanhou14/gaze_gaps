The case presented involves the question of whether priority in payment shall be accorded to taxes, which are liens against the property of the bankrupt under Pennsylvania laws, over the claims for wages of employees of the bankrupt earned within three months before the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings.

The Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA) provides that taxes shall be paid in advance of dividends to creditors, and "dividend" means partial payment to general creditors. Section 64a directs that taxes be paid in advance of dividends to creditors. In § 66b, the word "dividend" occurs in contrast to payment of debts which have priority. As the local laws gave no superior right to the city's unsecured claim for taxes, we are unable to conclude that Congress intended by § 64a to place it ahead of valid lien holders (New Jersey v. Anderson, 203 U. S. 483).

Section 67d provides that liens given or accepted in good faith and not in contemplation of or in fraud upon this act, shall not be affected by it. Since taxes are liens on the bankrupt's real estate, they are entitled to the protection afforded other classes of liens by section 67d. However, under section 64, taxes shall be paid in advance of dividends to creditors.

In Oliver v. United States, 268 U. S. 1, 45 S. Ct. 386, 69 L. Ed. 817, the Supreme Court held that federal and state taxes are to be paid in full before paying claims for preferred wages, unless it clearly appear that the particular tax in question has been subordinated to such claims by some relevant federal or local law. This decision led to the changes in section 64 by the amendment of 1926.

In conclusion, the court shall follow the amendment of 1926 and prioritize the payment of taxes in advance of dividends to creditors, as taxes are to be paid in full before paying claims for preferred wages (New Jersey v. Anderson, 203 U. S. 483). The referee's decision is affirmed, and the payment of the wage claims in full and the balance of the money in the hands of the trustee prorated among the tax claimants is upheld.

gold_text: In the case of City of Richmond v. Bird, 249 U. S. 174, 39 S. Ct. 186, 188, 63 L. Ed. 543, the Supreme Court, in construing these two sections of the Bankruptcy Act before the passage of the amendment of 1926, said: “Other provisions must, of course, be construed in view of this positive one.” At that, time section 67d was “the positive one”; but since the amendment of 1926 to section 64 makes no distinction between taxes which have become liens and those which have not, section 64 is now the “positive one” and section 67d must be construed in view of section 64 as it now stands.
