A.

Smith contends that the district court's reliance on Boone’s statements was clearly erroneous. To determine whether a factual finding is clearly erroneous, we assess if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, although there is evidence to support it (United States v. Robertson, 493 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2007); 470 U.S. 564). The district court thoroughly reviewed the grand jury testimony, PSR, and addendum, and found Boone’s account credible. Given the conflicting testimonies and absence of corroboration for Smith’s account, the court’s decision to credit Boone’s version does not meet the threshold for clear error.

B.

The appellant further argues ineffective assistance of counsel, pointing out his lawyer's failure to more aggressively counter Boone’s claims. However, review of counsel's performance is generally reserved for collateral proceedings unless the record is sufficiently developed (United States v. Lopez-Vanegas, 493 F.3d 1305, 1309 n. 6 (11th Cir.2007); 572 F.3d 878). Here, the record does not contain enough information to thoroughly evaluate the adequacy of Smith’s representation.

C.

Smith challenges the district court’s application of the sentencing guidelines de novo, asserting misapplication. We review such applications de novo (United States v. Jackson, 276 F.3d 1231, 1233 (11th Cir. 2001); 821 F.3d 1293). The court’s application of the four-level enhancement aligns with USSG § 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) since Smith’s possession of the firearm was connected to another felony offense, namely aggravated assault. Hence, this application was proper and not in error.

In summary, the district court’s findings were adequately supported by substantial evidence, and its decisions were neither clearly erroneous nor improper. The judgment is affirmed.

A finding is clearly erroneous if, after reviewing all the evidence, we are “left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” Id. (quotation omitted). A factfinder’s choice between “two permissible views of the evidence ... cannot be clearly erroneous.” United States v. Smith, 821 F.3d 1293, 1302 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Anderson v.
