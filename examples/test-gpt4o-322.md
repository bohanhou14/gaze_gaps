The legal definition of "significant" in the context of Section 12.05(c) requires close scrutiny. Under 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520(c), an impairment is considered severe if it significantly limits physical or mental abilities to perform basic work activities. The interpretation of "significant" as merely needing to surpass the "slight or minimal" threshold is supported by the Eleventh Circuit in Edwards v. Heckler, 736 F.2d 625. The court concluded that a claimant's impairments, when considered collectively, could meet the criteria of Section 12.05(c) if they impose significant work-related limitations (736 F.2d at 629-630).

Further supporting this, in a subsequent case, 755 F.2d 1513, it was emphasized that additional impairments under Section 12.05(c) need not be independently disabling but must only impose significant limitations. This aligns with the standard adopted by the First, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits, where "significant" is equated with the severity test at step two of the five-step disability analysis (Nieves v. Sec. Health and Human Services, 775 F.2d 12, 14; Warren v. Shalala, 29 F.3d 1287, 1291).

Therefore, under these precedents, an impairment that meets the “severe” criterion set forth in § 404.1520(c) satisfies the second prong of Section 12.05(c). Thus, the Commissioner should explicitly determine whether the plaintiff's lower back pain or other mental impairments meet this "severity" threshold to evaluate eligibility for benefits under Section 12.05(c).

gold_text: The Eleventh Circuit, though adopting the severity test at one point, see Edwards v. Heckler, 736 F.2d 625, 629-31 (11th Cir.1984), since has altered its position. Under Edwards ex rel. Edwards v. Heckler, "significant” requires something less than severe, as that term is understood in 20 C.F.R. Section 404.1520(c), yet something more than de minimis. 755 F.2d 1513, 1514-15 (11th Cir.1985). As the impact of the severity test is simply to weed out de minimis claims, it is arguable that it is not possible for a limitation to be more than a de minimis limitation and yet not be "severe” within the meaning of Section 404.1520(c).
