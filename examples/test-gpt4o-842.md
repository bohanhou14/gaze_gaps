Therefore, considering the above precedents, the district court is permitted but not required to take the non-prevailing party's financial status into account when awarding costs (see 229 F.3d 1012). Plaintiff has not provided substantial documentation to substantiate a true inability to pay, as required by cases like McGill v. Faulkner, 18 F.3d 456, 459 (7th Cir. 1994). Additionally, the precedent in Cherry v. Champion International Corp., 186 F.3d 442, 448 (4th Cir. 1999) prohibits comparison of the parties' relative wealth.

Moreover, given that the Plaintiff initiated extensive deposition practices, it aligns with the rationale in Whitfield v. Scully, 241 F.3d 264, 270 (2d Cir. 2001), where such costs are routinely allowed as taxable. The Plaintiff's objections lack merit, mirroring the reasonings applied in pardazi v. Cullman Med. Ctr., 838 F.2d 1155 (11th Cir. 1988), and McGill v. Faulkner, 18 F.3d 456 (7th Cir.1994).

In conclusion, the taxation of costs aligns with Rule 54(d) and is justified under the circumstances highlighted in previous case laws (231 F.3d 572, 229 F.3d 1012). Consequently, I affirm the Clerk’s decision and see no reason to modify the cost awards. The objections raised by Plaintiff are dismissed as frivolous and unsupported.

If the court in its discretion considers the non-prevailing party’s financial status, it should decline to impose costs only where there is clear proof of the non-prevailing party’s “dire financial circumstances.” Chapman v.
