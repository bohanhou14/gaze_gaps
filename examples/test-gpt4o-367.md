Our conclusion is informed by the established principles regarding the imposition of contempt and sanctions. As elucidated in reference case 971 F.2d 926, sanctions imposed under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 require a finding of bad faith, and procedural due process must be afforded. The due process limitations inherent in sanctioning were also highlighted in reference case 512 U.S. 821, emphasizing the necessity of procedural protections before imposing non-compensatory fines. These cases underscore that any punitive fines constitute a form of criminal contempt, necessitating due process, including notice and an opportunity to be heard (Hathcock v. Navistar Int’l Transportation Corp., 53 F.3d 36).

Moreover, the imposition of noncompensatory fines absent due process contravenes the principles laid down in reference case 80 F.3d 64, which stressed the need for ensuring due process even when sanctions are imposed under Rule 37 without explicit contempt findings. Therefore, in alignment with these precedents, the district court's failure to provide Mo with the requisite procedural safeguards mandates the vacation of his fine and a remand for further proceedings consistent with due process requirements. Thus, we vacate the $10,000 fine and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

gold_text: . Although Mo’s sanction appears to have been a criminal, as opposed to a civil, fine, see, e.g., People of the State of New York v. Operation Rescue Nat’l, 80 F.3d 64, 68 n. 7 (2d Cir.) ("[A] non-compensatory fine is civil, and thus may ordinarily be imposed in the absence of a criminal trial 'only if the contemnor is afforded an opportunity to purge.' ") (quoting International Union, United Mine Workers v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, -, 114 S.Ct. 2552, 2558, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994)), cert. denied, - U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 85, 136 L.Ed.2d 42 (1996), we need not decide which it was here. For even a civil fine cannot stand when it is imposed without basic due process safeguards. "[A] person charged with civil contempt is entitled to notice of the allegations, the right to counsel, and a hearing at which the ... defendant has an opportunity to present a defense.” Schoenberg v. Shapolsky Publishers, Inc., 971 F.2d 926, 934-35 (2d Cir.1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We note, however, that if the district court wishes on remand to impose a criminal fine, it must first provide all of the procedural protections associated with criminal proceedings.
