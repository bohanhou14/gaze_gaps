After analyzing the legal cases, I have identified a few key points that are relevant to the discussion. First, it is important to note that errors of law are cognizable under Rule 60(b). This is supported by the case of Gila River Ranch, Inc. v. United States, 368 F.2d 354, which states that the district court did have power under Rule 60(b)(1) to reconsider its award of costs.

In addition, it is important to consider the law of the case doctrine, which states that lower courts are free to decide issues on remand so long as they were not decided on a prior appeal. This is supported by the case of Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 347 n.18, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 1148 n.18, 59 L.Ed.2d 358, 370 n.18 (1979).

Furthermore, it is important to note that the district court did not err in granting Liberty's Rule 60 motion to deny the state costs. This is supported by the case of Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. et al. v. California, 652 F.2d 63 (9th Cir. 1981) (unpublished).

In conclusion, the legal cases cited above support the conclusion that errors of law are cognizable under Rule 60(b) and that the law of the case doctrine applies to issues decided on remand. Furthermore, the district court did not err in granting Liberty's Rule 60 motion to deny the state costs.
