Rezner’s RICO claim requires a demonstration that HVB’s fraudulent conduct proximately caused his injury. As emphasized in **Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479**, a violation of § 1962(c) necessitates (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity, and the plaintiff must allege each element and show injury to his business or property by the violation's conduct. HVB contends that this proximate causation was not met, asserting Rezner's injury was self-inflicted due to his participation in the tax shelter scheme.

Moreover, in **Holmes v. SIPC, 503 U.S. 258**, the Supreme Court underscored that for a RICO claim, a plaintiff must prove that their injury was directly caused "by reason of" the defendant's violation of § 1962, implying that there must be a direct relationship between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.

In the present case, Rezner’s injury arose from the IRS's disallowance of his claimed tax benefits, which were based on the fraudulent CARDS transactions. While HVB’s scheme defrauded the United States, Rezner’s subsequent action to claim these benefits on his tax return was a pivotal link in the chain of causation. Thus, the district court’s determination that HVB’s actions proximately caused Rezner’s injury, insufficiently considered Rezner’s own participation and consequent tax penalties as an intervening factor that breaks the necessary causation chain under RICO.

Hence, the application of these precedents reveals that the district court erred in finding a direct causal link sufficient to satisfy RICO’s proximate causation requirement.

gold_text: To state a civil claim for a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must show “(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.” Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). To have standing under civil RICO, Rezner is required to show that the racketeering activity was both a but-for cause and a proximate cause of his injury. See Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992). Proximate causation for RICO purposes requires “some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.” Id. Rezner argues that HVB’s defrauding of the United States through the CARDS facility caused his injury. There is no dispute that HVB defrauded the United States through CARDS. We hold, however, that HVB’s fraudulent activity towards the United States did not cause Rezner’s injury.
