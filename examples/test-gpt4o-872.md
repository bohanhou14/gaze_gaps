We must first address the enforceability of the government’s agreement not to seek an enhancement under § 924(e)(1). According to the principle articulated in United States v. Williamsburg Check Cashing Corp., an agreement to withhold pertinent information from the sentencing judge cannot be upheld because a sentencing court must be able to consider any and all information relevant to determining an appropriate sentence (973 F.2d 857, quoting 905 F.2d 25, 28). Once the court determined that the conditions for § 924(e)(1) were met, the enhancement was mandatory and non-discretionary. 

Moreover, Rule 35 allows the court to correct an illegal sentence at any time, and the imposition of an illegal sentence constitutes plain error (United States v. Vance, 938 F.2d 1096, quoting 868 F.2d 1167, 1169). Here, Moyer’s sentence was contrary to the statutory requirement as § 924(e)(1) states that any qualifying defendant "shall be … imprisoned not less than fifteen years," and this mandatory minimum cannot be waived even by the government (973 F.2d 857). 

Given these precedents, the district court erred in not applying the 15-year mandatory minimum under § 924(e)(1). We therefore remand the case for re-sentencing consistent with this statutory mandate.

gold_text: In United, States v. Johnson, this court concluded that the application of § 924(e)(1) is mandatory and “does not require government action to trigger its application nor does it vest discretion in the sentencing court not to apply its mandate.” 973 F.2d 857, 860 (10th Cir.1992). Based on our conclusion, supra, that Moyer’s three Wyoming felony convictions are “violent felonies,” it is clear that Moyer’s sentence should have been calculated by applying § 924(e)(1), not § 924(a)(2). Because the ten-year sentence imposed by the district court does not reflect the mandatory minimum mandated by § 924(e)(1) and Johnson, it is an illegal sentence. See United States v. Wainwright, 938 F.2d 1096, 1098 (10th Cir.1991) (defining an illegal sentence as one which “omits a term required to be imposed by statute”); see also U.S.S.G. § 5Gl.l(b) (“Where a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.”).
