In considering the defendants' burden of proof regarding the fairness of the CAT as a measure of the curriculum taught, it is essential to look at relevant case law. In *Board of Curators of the University of Missouri v. Horowitz*, 435 U.S. 78, the Supreme Court noted that "the due process requirements of notice and hearing" have been cautiously limited to disciplinary decisions, emphasizing that academic evaluations require a different due process approach. Here, the nature of the inquiry is evaluative rather than disciplinary, and the significant interest in maintaining academic standards supports the view that extensive procedural safeguards are not mandated. Similarly, *Greenhill v. Bailey*, 513 F.2d 843, underlined that school authorities only need to inform students of their academic deficiencies. The courts are traditionally reluctant to interfere with academic judgments unless there is clear evidence of bad motive or ill will. Dr. Calfee's objections do not rise to this level of proof required to deem the CAT constitutionally unfair. Thus, considering both the educational discretion acknowledged in Horowitz and Bailey, and the comprehensive evidence provided by the defendants, the Court finds the CAT to be a fair test of the material taught in Tattnall County schools.

The additional testimonies and analyses presented neither convincingly shift the burden of proof away from the defendants nor invalidate the careful curriculum match established. Therefore, based on the principles elucidated in these cases, the Court concludes that the defendants have met their due process obligations.

gold_text: Previous to the decision in Debra P., the Court is unaware of any judicial decision which placed the burden on the school authorities to prove that their academic evaluative decisions were not violative of substantive due process. In the area of procedural due process courts have been careful to distinguish academic as opposed to disciplinary dismissals. Board of Curators, University of Missouri v. Horowitz, 435 U.S. 78, 98 S.Ct. 948, 55 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977); Mahavongsanan v. Hall, 529 F.2d 448 (5th Cir. 1976); Gaspar v. Bruton, 513 F.2d 843 (10th Cir. 1975). This reluctance on the part of the courts to review academic dismissals is based on the courts’ lack of expertise in evaluating academic decisions. In Horowitz, the Supreme Court remarked, “Courts are particularly ill-equipped to evaluate academic performance. The factors discussed in Part II with respect to procedural due process speak a fortiori here and warn against any such judicial intrusion into academic decision-making.” Horowitz, supra, at 92.
