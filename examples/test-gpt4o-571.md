Defendants argue that the district court misconstrued the statute of limitations by allowing the fraud claim to proceed. They assert that the Kubrick rule, as explained in United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, indicates that the statute of limitations begins when the plaintiff "knows both the existence and the cause of his injury" (729 F.2d 818). Defendants claim that Kropinski knew or should have known of the alleged fraud by a much earlier date, hence barring his claim. 

However, just as in Page's case where limitations could not begin until the full extent of malpractice was evident (729 F.2d 818), here too, the unique nature of the alleged brainwashing ('thought reform') potentially altered Kropinski’s perception. This delayed acknowledgment of fraud aligns with the principle from case 662 F.2d 65, where dismissal based on statute of limitations was premature without considering the plaintiff’s circumstances and allegations of fraud and its discovery.

Further, the doctrine laid out in reference case 662 F.2d 65 supports the need for a jury to assess the actual time of fraud discovery, especially under complex and nuanced situations. Therefore, the court's decision to leave the statute of limitations defense to the jury was appropriate, affirming the necessity of jury determination in such nuanced matters.

In conclusion, the district court did not err in allowing the fraud claim to proceed on statute of limitations grounds, as the jury rightly adjudged the complexities involved in discovering the injury and its cause.

gold_text: When one person defrauds another, there will be a delay between the time the fraud is perpetrated and the time the victim awakens to the fact. Accordingly, in a fraud case, the statute of limitations will not begin running until the date the fraud is discovered, or reasonably should have been. King v. Kitchen Magic, Inc., 391 A.2d 1184, 1186 (D.C.1978); see Richards v. Mileski, 662 F.2d 65, 71 (D.C.Cir.1981) (due diligence test applied to reasonableness of claimant’s efforts to uncover existence of a claim). In some cases, most notably medical treatment cases, the running of the statute is tolled beyond the discovery date if the tortfeasor reassures the victim that the negative effects should be expected as part of the treatment, and if a reasonable person would believe such reassurances. See Page v. United States, 729 F.2d 818, 823 & n. 36 (D.C.Cir.1984).
