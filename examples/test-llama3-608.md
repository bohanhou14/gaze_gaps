Based on the reference cases, it is clear that the reservation created by the Act of 1891 includes not only the upland of the islands but also the adjacent waters and submerged land. This is evident from the language used in the Act, which refers to "the body of lands known as Annette Islands" (248 U.S. 78). The court held that the term "body of lands" includes not only the upland but also the waters and submerged land.

In another case, the court held that the RCRA applies to Indian tribes and that they are subject to the same regulations as other governments (532 F.2d 655). The court also held that the BIA and IHS have a duty to clean up the dump sites and that they are responsible for the health and well-being of the Indian people.

In addition, the court referenced several other cases that support the idea that the BIA and IHS have a duty to clean up the dump sites. These cases include United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians, Menominee Tribe v. United States, Seminole Nation v. United States, and United States v. Klamath Indians, among others.

Overall, it is clear that the BIA and IHS have a duty to clean up the dump sites and that they are responsible for the health and well-being of the Indian people. This duty is supported by the RCRA and several other cases that have been referenced in this analysis.

BIA and IHS have not merely violated the RCRA, but, in so doing, they have violated their fiduciary obligation toward the plaintiffs and the Tribe. They are required to insure that the dumps are cleaned up, even if others contributed to the problem and even if the RCRA does not clearly set forth what role BIA and IHS are to play under the statute.
