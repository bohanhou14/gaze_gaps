The case presented is a habeas corpus petition, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict a defendant of manslaughter in the first degree. The petition argues that the evidence presented was insufficient to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, as the only incriminating evidence was the testimony of an eyewitness who had been drinking heavily at the time of the crime. The petition also argues that the trial court erred in excluding a hearsay statement from the defendant's friend, Benny Leon, which could have been used to exculpate the defendant.

In reviewing the petition, the court must consider whether the evidence presented was sufficient to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court must also consider whether the exclusion of the hearsay statement was prejudicial to the defendant, as required by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

In applying the standard set forth in Jackson v. Virginia, the court must determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, the court finds that a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty based on the eyewitness testimony, even considering the potential unreliability of the testimony due to the eyewitness's intoxication.

Regarding the hearsay statement, the court must consider whether its exclusion was prejudicial to the defendant. In this case, the court finds that the exclusion was not prejudicial, as the statement was not corroborated and did not have any indicia of reliability under the New York hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest, as set forth in Settles v. New York.

In conclusion, the petition for habeas corpus is denied, as the evidence presented was sufficient to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and the exclusion of the hearsay statement was not prejudicial to the defendant. The court's decision is supported by the standards set forth in Jackson v. Virginia and Settles v. New York.

gold_text: Exclusion of the “Martin” portion of Benny Leon’s statement in the cab was clearly proper under the New York criteria for admissibility because the statement at least arguably lacked the required element of personal adversity, and surely lacked the corroboration element. To begin with, it seems problematic whether that portion of Benny’s statement referring to Martin’s future crimes was sufficiently adverse to Benny's own penal interest to permit its admission into evidence under Settles or other traditional formulations of this hearsay exception. Conceivably, however, even the “Martin” portion of the conversation was sufficiently adverse to Benny’s own interests to permit admissibility under the penal interest exception. Cf. United States v. Brainard, 690 F.2d 1117, 1124 (4th Cir.1983), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1099, 105 S.Ct. 2320, 85 L.Ed.2d 839 (1985); United States v. Barrett, 539 F.2d 244, 252-253 (1st Cir.1976) (statement of a third party’s lack of criminal involvement may be against declarant’s own penal interest by strengthening the impression of declarant’s insider knowledge and therefore guilt). In any event, the trial judge did not rely on this element of the hearsay exception in his decision to redact the “Martin” portion of Benny’s declaration.
