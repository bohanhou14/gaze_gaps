The case at hand involves a civilian pay dispute, where the plaintiff, Dr. Andrew Dancy, seeks back pay and damages for his separation from his medical position with the government. The defendant, the United States, argues that the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) properly upheld the action of the agency, which was forced to separate plaintiff after balancing the procedural rights of plaintiff to notification and the substantive reemployment rights of plaintiff's predecessor.

In reviewing the MSPB decision, the court must accord wide discretion to the agency in conducting a reduction in force, absent a clear abuse of that discretion. As stated in Summers v. United States, 228 Ct.Cl. -, -, 648 F.2d 1324, 1326-7 (1981), an agency is accorded wide discretion in conducting a reduction in force; absent a clear abuse of that discretion, a substantial departure from applicable procedures, a misconstruction of governing statutes, or the like, we do not upset a final agency decision.

The plaintiff argues that the MSPB erred in finding that the agency's failure to notify him of his predecessor's reemployment rights was "harmless error." However, the court finds that the agency was legally bound by statute to afford Dr. Jones his reemployment rights, and therefore, the agency was compelled to balance the substantive statutory rights of Dr. Jones against plaintiff's procedural right to notification under the permissive language of the Army regulation.

Furthermore, the court notes that the plaintiff's failure to file an administrative claim with the United States Army Claims Service is a jurisdictional prerequisite for filing suit in district court. As stated in 28 C.F.R. ยง 14.2(a) (1980), an administrative tort claim must be filed within two years of the date on which the claim accrues. Since the plaintiff failed to file an administrative claim, the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case.

In conclusion, the court upholds the MSPB decision affirming the separation of the plaintiff, and finds that the plaintiff's failure to file an administrative claim is a jurisdictional prerequisite that cannot be waived. As stated in 449 F.2d 124, the court must strictly construe the waiver of sovereign immunity and cannot predicate liability on a theory of actual or constructive notice.
