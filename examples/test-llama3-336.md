In the context of asylum claims, the issue of corroboration is crucial. In reference case 453 F.3d 151, the court held that an adverse credibility determination must be supported by specific, cogent reasons why the applicant is not credible. Additionally, only inconsistencies going to the heart of a claim will be deemed to compromise an applicant's credibility.

In the present case, the Immigration Judge (IJ) found a number of discrepancies in the record, including inconsistencies in Mbube's testimony and documents. Specifically, Mbube offered contradictory evidence concerning the nature of the beatings following his fourth arrest, and failed to mention his mother's arrest at the merits hearing. The IJ found that these inconsistencies went to the heart of Mbube's claim and compromised his credibility as a whole.

In reference case 239 F.3d 542, the court discussed the BIA's rule requiring corroborating evidence in some cases. The court noted that the BIA's rule contemplates a three-part inquiry: (1) an identification of the facts for which "it is reasonable to expect corroboration;” (2) an inquiry as to whether the applicant has provided information corroborating the relevant facts; and, if he or she has not, (3) an analysis of whether the applicant has adequately explained his or her failure to do so.

In this case, the IJ did not explicitly state that she required corroborating evidence, but her analysis suggests that she considered Mbube's failure to provide corroboration as part of her adverse credibility determination. The IJ's decision was supported by substantial evidence, and we will deny Mbube's petition for review.

gold_text: Mbube argues that the IJ erred in requiring evidence corroborating that Mbube was a member of the SCNC who suffered persecution in Cameroon. We find no error in the IJ’s request for corroboration. The BIA has adopted rules which require corroboration in instances where it is reasonable to expect such proof from a witness and there is no satisfactory explanation for its absence. Obale v. Attorney General, 453 F.3d 151, 163 (3d Cir.2006). These rules, which we approved in Abdulai v. Ashcroft, 239 F.3d 542 (3d Cir.2001), involve a three step analysis: (1) an identification of facts for which it is reasonable to expect corroboration; (2) the presence or absence of such corroboration in the record; and (3) the adequacy of applicant’s explanation for its absence. The third prong presumes that the IJ offers a petitioner an opportunity to explain the absence. Obale, 453 F.3d at 163.
