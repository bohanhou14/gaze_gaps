Under 11 U.S.C. § 362(d)(2), relief from the automatic stay is justified if the debtor lacks equity in the property and the property is not necessary to an effective reorganization. The burden of proof regarding a debtor's equity in the property rests on the moving party, whereas the burden on other issues lies with the debtor (see 357 B.R. 669). Coastal has demonstrated that the Debtor lacks equity in the Property. Coastal's secured claims exceed the value of the Property, making it undersecured by $28,937.42 as per the factual findings.

The Debtor must then establish that the Property is necessary for an effective reorganization. As ruled in United Savings Ass’n v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates Ltd., 484 U.S. 365, 374 (1988), a debtor must show more than a mere possibility of reorganization, but that an effective reorganization is in prospect (see reference case 258 B.R. 278). Given the Debtor's reliance on the Property’s rental income to fund the Chapter 13 plan and the early stage of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Debtor has shown the Property is necessary for an effective reorganization. Therefore, Coastal is not entitled to relief under § 362(d)(2).

In terms of adequate protection under 11 U.S.C. § 362(d)(1), the Plan includes periodic cash payments to Coastal, which sufficiently protect its interest in the Property. Hence, Coastal’s argument for inadequate protection fails. Given these considerations, Coastal’s Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay is due to be denied.

gold_text: The term “equity” is not defined by the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Courts have uniformly held no equity exists in property where the claims secured by the property exceed the value of the property. In re Annicott Excellence, LLC. 258 B.R. 278, 284 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.2001); In re Ramos, 357 B.R. 669, 671 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.2006). Any rental income generated by the Property is not relevant to an equity calculation. See, In re Annicott, 258 B.R. at 284 (finding debt- or, who owned and operated five mobile home parks that generated rental income, had no equity in the properties where the secured debt encumbering the properties exceeded their value).
