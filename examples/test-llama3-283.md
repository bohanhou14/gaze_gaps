Based on the reference cases, I will analyze the classification of the merchandise in question. The court in Reference case 915 F. Supp. 399 noted that "the meaning of a tariff term, a matter of statutory interpretation, is a question of law" (Mead Corp. v. United States, 185 F.3d 1304, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 1999)). In this case, the term "toy" is defined by the court as an object designed for amusement or diversion rather than practical use (Webster's Third New International Dictionary, 1986).

Applying the definition, the court finds that the subject merchandise is a toy, as it is designed to be used for play and amusement. The court also notes that the subject merchandise is not a container for bubble bath, as it is not designed for practical use (Universal Electronics., Inc. v. United States, 112 F.3d 488, 492 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).

In Reference case 78 Cust. Ct. 28, the court held that the classification of merchandise is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs) and the Additional U.S. Rules of Interpretation (ARIs) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).

Applying the GRIs and ARIs, the court finds that the subject merchandise is properly classified under HTSUS heading 9503, which covers "toys representing animals or non-human creatures (for example, robots and monsters) and parts and accessories thereof."

The court also notes that the subject merchandise is not a "stuffed toy" as it is not designed to be filled with material, but rather it is a hollow figure designed for play and amusement. Therefore, it is properly classified under HTSUS subheading 9503.49.00, which covers "other" toys.

In conclusion, based on the reference cases, the court finds that the subject merchandise is properly classified under HTSUS heading 9503 and subheading 9503.49.00. The court's decision is supported by the statutory interpretation of the term "toy" and the application of the GRIs and ARIs of the HTSUS.

gold_text: This conclusion is also consistent with the definition and treatment of the term “toy” under the predecessor to the HTSUS, the Tariff Schedules of the United States (“TSUS”).See, e.g.,J.C. Penney Purchasing Corp. v. United States, 10 CIT 727, 728 (1986) (noting that schedule 7, part 5, subpart E, headnote 2 of the TSUS defined a “toy” as “any article chiefly used for the amusement of children or adults”); Ideal Toy Corp. v. United States, 78 Cust. Ct. 28, 33 (1977) (“When amusement and utility become locked in controversy, the question becomes one of determining whether the amusement is incidental to the utilitarian purpose, or the utility purpose incidental to the amusement.”); see also Pima Western, Inc. v. United States, 20 CIT 110, 116-17, 915 F. Supp. 399, 404-05 (1996) (“[0]n a case-by-case basis prior decisions should be considered instructive in interpreting the HTS, particularly where the nomenclature previously interpreted in those decisions remains unchanged and no dissimilar interpretation is required by the text of the HTS[US].” (quoting H. Conf. R. No. 576, at 549-50)).
