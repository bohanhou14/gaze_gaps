Furthermore, defendants argue that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the admission of evidence obtained through unauthorized surveillance. However, established precedent dictates that even in cases where unauthorized surveillance occurs on the premises, protection against such evidence only extends to instances where the homeowner's conversational privacy is invaded (see 394 U.S. 165). Thus, the evidence gathered from third-party conversations on the premises, in absence of the homeowner's direct participation, does not necessarily invoke Fourth Amendment protections as asserted by the dissent in the referenced case.

Next, the appellants maintain that their constitutional protections against illegal searches and seizures should lead to the suppression of evidence, unless they can demonstrate a significant possessory interest in the premises or the items seized (as iterated in 362 U.S. 257). Since narcotics offenses can be proven solely through possession, a defendant must often disclose incriminating facts to challenge the search, which complicates the standing requirement. In this case, the government’s evidence was lawfully admitted as the appellants did not conclusively prove such a significant interest.

Ultimately, the judgments are affirmed, as the legal standards for evidence suppression under the Fourth Amendment and standing requirements in narcotics cases were appropriately applied in this trial.
