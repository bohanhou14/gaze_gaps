OPINION AND DECISION

POLLACK, Senior District Judge.

The defendants move to dismiss the Second Claim of the Second Consolidated Class Action Complaint, brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO"), 18 U.S.C. § 1961, et seq. The Second Claim alleges that the defendants, Global Minerals and Metals Corp. ("Global") and R. David Campbell ("Campbell"), conducted a RICO enterprise through a pattern of mail fraud and wire fraud.

The court finds that the allegations of the Second Claim are sufficient to state a claim under RICO. The court notes that the allegations of a RICO enterprise are sufficient, citing United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981).

Regarding the sufficiency of the allegations of mail and wire fraud, the court looks to the Second Circuit's decision in Spira v. Nick, 876 F.Supp. 553, 559 (S.D.N.Y.1995), where the court held that mailings in furtherance of a scheme, but not themselves false or misleading, are not "averments of fraud" within the language of Rule 9(b). The court also looks to the Second Circuit's decision in Center Cadillac v. Bank Leumi Trust Co., 808 F.Supp. 213, 229 (S.D.N.Y.1992), where the court held that a detailed description of the underlying scheme and the connection therewith of the mail and/or wire communications is sufficient to satisfy Rule 9(b).

Finally, regarding the sufficiency of the allegations of reliance, the court looks to the Second Circuit's decision in County of Suffolk v. Long Island Lighting Co., 907 F.2d 1295, 1311 (2d Cir.1989), where the court held that a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's misrepresentations were relied upon.

Based on the foregoing, the court denies the defendants' motion to dismiss the Second Claim.
