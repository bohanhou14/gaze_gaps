**Generation:**

The Court's determination that the plaintiff, General, is entitled to enforce Notes 1, 2, and 3, despite their loss, aligns with the principle established in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, where it was held that the burden of proof lies with the non-moving party to show a genuine issue for trial when responding to a well-supported motion for summary judgment. Additionally, the adoption of the federal prescriptive period in this case, as argued successfully by the plaintiff, mirrors the guidance provided in Beck v. Somerset Technologies, Inc., 969 F.2d 1559, 1277, confirming that summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact. Therefore:

IT IS ORDERED that defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the plaintiff shall prepare a proposed judgment in accordance with this ruling, approved by defendants, and submit to the Court within fifteen days of this order.

These rulings apply the established criteria from the reference cases ensuring no genuine issues of material fact are left for trial.
