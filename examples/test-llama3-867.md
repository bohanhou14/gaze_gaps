As discussed in the case Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers v. Anaconda Co., 260 F.Supp. 445, 448 (D.Mont. 1966), the union has framed its issues to claim rights not only "now" but during the term of the collective bargaining agreement. Similarly, in United Steelworkers of America v. American Manufacturing Co., 363 U.S. 564, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960), the Court stated that a court's function is limited when the parties have agreed to submit all questions of contract interpretation to the arbitrator. The court's role is to determine whether the party seeking arbitration is making a claim which on its face is governed by the contract, and not to weigh the merits of the grievance.

In this case, the union is seeking to compel arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement, which provides for arbitration of controversies involving the discharge of employees. The employer has refused to arbitrate, claiming that the controversy was settled. However, as mentioned in United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960), the Court has no business weighing the merits of the grievance or considering whether there is equity in a particular claim. The agreement is to submit all grievances to arbitration, not merely those which the court will deem meritorious.

Accordingly, the court should not grant the employer's request to refuse arbitration based on the claim that the controversy was settled. Instead, the court should compel the employer to arbitrate the controversy, as provided in the collective bargaining agreement. This is consistent with the decision in United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960), which held that a court should not refuse to compel arbitration based on a claim that the controversy was settled.

In conclusion, the court should compel the employer to arbitrate the controversy involving Mildred Perry's termination, as provided in the collective bargaining agreement. The union has framed its issues to claim rights not only "now" but during the term of the collective bargaining agreement, and the employer has refused to arbitrate without a valid reason. The

gold_text: First, it might be said that the settlement agreement implicitly waived plaintiffâ€™s right to proceed to arbitration. In John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U.S. 543, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964), however, the Court enunciated the rule that questions of whether the procedural prerequisites which condition a duty to arbitrate have been met should be for the arbiter to determine. Under this rule the issue of whether arbitration has been waived is one for the arbiter to decide. Transit Union v. Greyhound, Lines, Inc., 323 F.Supp. 219 (D.Mass.1971). See also, Koven & Brother, Inc. v. Steelworkers, 381 F.2d 196 (3d Cir. 1967); General Warehousemen and Employees v. American Hardware Supply Co., 329 F.2d 789 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 829, 85 S.Ct. 57, 13 L.Ed.2d 37 (1964); Automobile, Aircraft, and Agricultural Implement Workers v. Daniel Radiator Corp., 328 F.2d 614 (5th Cir. 1964). Such a result is especially appropriate here, since plaintiff has denied the existence of any settlement agreement, and defendant has not asserted that the agreement included any explicit waiver of arbitration.
