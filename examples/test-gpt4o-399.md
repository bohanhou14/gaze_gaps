DM’s argument regarding the jury instructions parallels challenges addressed in 281 F.3d 487, where the court examined erroneous jury instructions and noted that such errors necessitate a reversal only if the instructions as a whole created substantial doubt about whether the jury was properly guided. In this case, DM's contention is that the district court misdirected the jury by failing to limit the damages award to reflect Bell's fifty percent ownership. 

However, like in the reference case, the failure to object specifically to this instruction during trial may hold weight. According to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 51, objections to jury instructions must typically be made before the jury retires to deliberate. Absent such timely objections, the appellate review is for plain error, and as emphasized in 281 F.3d 487, this court grants considerable deference to the trial court's instructions unless they result in a significant misguidance of the jury's deliberative process.

Furthermore, DM's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence and the court's ruling regarding the interpretation of the Recording Agreement echoes the issues in 631 F.3d 203, where the appellate court upheld the lower court's decision, highlighting that extrinsic evidence and credibility determinations should be assessed by the court unless the evidence is conflicting.

Given that DM did not properly object to the jury instructions nor provide conflicting evidence necessitating jury determination, we find no substantial misguidance impacting the damages award. The district court’s jury instructions did not properly prejudice DM, and thus, the damages award remains affirmed.
