Refund to Hayes

The interplay between the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) and § 406(b)(1) of the Social Security Act has been explicitly addressed in legislative history and supporting case law. Specifically, the legislative history clarifies that an EAJA award in Social Security cases does not preclude a § 406(b) fee award and vice versa, but mandates that the attorney refund the smaller fee to the claimant to avoid dual compensation (see H.R.Rep. No. 120, 99th Cong. 1st Sess. 7 (1985); U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 132, 135-36; reference case 868 F.2d 867).

In the present case, Carpenter is obligated to refund the smaller fee, either the $2,130.84 EAJA award or the $9,231.25 awarded under § 406(b)(1), to Hayes. This requirement prevents double payment for the same work and ensures that the client benefits from the higher fee awarded under § 406(b), a principle upheld in Weakley v. Bowen (803 F.2d 575, 580). Notably, the court in another similar case emphasized the importance of clear records to facilitate meaningful review (Glass v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 822 F.2d 19, 22 (6th Cir.1987); reference case 868 F.2d 867).

Accordingly, the court orders Carpenter to refund the EAJA fee of $2,130.84 to Hayes. This ensures compliance with congressional intent and relevant case law, maintaining fairness in fee allocation.

gold_text: Courts have made clear that the availability of attorney’s fees under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 406, does not preclude an award of fees under the EAJA. See, e.g., Russell [v. Sullivan], 930 F.2d [1443] at 1446 [(9th Cir.1991) ]; Jankovich v. Bowen, 868 F.2d 867, 870-71 (6th Cir.1989); Weakley v. Bowen, 803 F.2d 575, § 80 (10th Cir.1986). An award of fees under the Social Security Act is deducted from the claimant’s disability benefits, whereas an EAJA award is paid separately by the government. Where fees are awarded under both provisions, the EAJA compensation therefore serves as a reimbursement to the claimant for fees paid out of the disability award. See, e.g., Jankovich, 868 F.2d at 870-71. And double recovery is prevented in that the attorney must refund the amount of the smaller fee to the claimant. Id. at 871 n. 1.
