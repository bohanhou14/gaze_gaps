Moreover, as highlighted in First National Fidelity Corp. v. Perry, 945 F.2d 61 (3rd Cir.1991), the intention behind Congress enacting § 1322(b)(2) was to extend special protections to home mortgages, and it is unlikely that Congress intended these protections to vanish upon the issuance of a foreclosure judgment. The Perry court reasoned that a security interest transforming into a judicial lien post-judgment would undermine this congressional intent, and therefore, a security interest does not become a judicial lien upon issuance of a foreclosure judgment.

Similarly, in In re Coleman, 82 B.R. 15 (Bankr.D.N.J.1988), the court found that § 1322(b)(2) does not apply because a foreclosure judgment is not a lien created by an agreement, reinforcing the notion that these classifications remain distinct. The same principles were echoed in In re Brunson, 87 B.R. 304 (Bankr.D.N.J.1988) and In re McKeon, 86 B.R. 350 (Bankr.D.N.J.1988), where the courts differentiated between secured claims and judicial liens.

Thus, aligning with the rationales in Perry and Coleman, the doctrine of merger declared in In re Schlecht, 36 B.R. 236 (Bankr.Alaska 1983), further confirms that the original security interest stands even when the related claim merges into the judgment. Consequently, the Creditors' lien remains a security interest, and the Debtors cannot avoid it under § 522(f)(1)(A). Therefore, the Court denies the Debtors’ motion to avoid the lien and grants the Creditors’ motion for relief from the automatic stay.

Counsel for Creditors is directed to lodge a proposed form of order consistent with this decision.

Perry, 945 F.2d 61, 63 (3rd Cir.1991) (a case cited by the Creditors), the Perry court notes that, in In re Coleman, 82 B.R. 15, 18 (Bankr.D.N.J.1988), a bankruptcy court concluded that § 1322(b)(2) did not apply to a security interest that had been reduced to a foreclosure judgment pre-petition because the foreclosure judgment was not a lien created by an agreement and therefore did not qualify as a "security interest” under the Bankruptcy Code.
