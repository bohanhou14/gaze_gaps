In both cases, the courts have considered the issue of whether the comment rule, which allows the state to tender evidence of an accused's failure to testify, violates the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause.

In the case of 380 U.S. 609, the court held that the comment rule does indeed violate the Fifth Amendment, as it allows the state to comment on the accused's silence, which is equivalent to an offer of evidence and its acceptance. The court noted that the act was framed with a due regard to those who might prefer to rely on the presumption of innocence, but concluded that the comment rule was inconsistent with the Griffin rule, which prohibits comment on the accused's failure to testify.

In the case of 438 F.2d 814, the court considered whether the conduct of the judge and prosecutor at the trial was inconsistent with the Griffin rule. The court noted that the law of the state at the time permitted such comment and charge as the Griffin decision was soon to proscribe, and that the prosecutor's comment and the court's charge were equivalent to an offer of evidence and its acceptance. The court concluded that both the judge and prosecutor did precisely what the Griffin decision holds they may not do without prejudicial violation of a fundamental constitutional privilege of the accused.

In conclusion, the courts have consistently held that the comment rule, which allows the state to tender evidence of an accused's failure to testify, violates the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause. This is because it allows the state to comment on the accused's silence, which is equivalent to an offer of evidence and its acceptance, and is inconsistent with the Griffin rule, which prohibits comment on the accused's failure to testify.
