The case at hand involves an award of attorney’s fees to the State of Wisconsin under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(e), the fee-shifting provision governing improper removal. The principal issue is whether § 1447(c) permits salaried government attorneys to recover at prevailing market rates.

The district court awarded the state $5,583.60 in attorney’s fees, basing its decision on the prevailing rate in Madison, Wisconsin for lawyers specializing in similar work. Hotline Industries, Inc. appeals, arguing that the state did not incur any reimbursable attorney’s fees because its lawyers were salaried employees. However, the court correctly followed the general rule for calculating fee awards made under numerous statutes authorizing a “reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.”

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that “reasonable fees” under fee-shifting statutes such as 42 U.S.C. § 1988 “are to be calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community,” regardless of whether the plaintiff is represented by a private law firm or a legal aid society (Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984)). This rule has been applied even when the victorious party is represented by salaried government counsel (Hamer v. Lake County, 819 F.2d 1362, 1365 n. 9 (7th Cir.1987); Hamilton v. Daley, 777 F.2d 1207, 1213 (7th Cir.1985)).

In contrast, § 1447(c) explicitly limits fee awards to actual outlays, specifically to “any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred” (emphasis added). This limitation is significant, as it restricts the award of fees to the actual costs incurred by the party, rather than a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs. The legislative history of this change reveals that the amendment was intended to ensure that a substantive basis exists for requiring payment of actual expenses incurred in resisting an improper removal.

Therefore, the district court’s award of attorney’s fees to the State of Wisconsin under § 1447(c) is affirmed. The court correctly awarded the state $5,583.60 in attorney’s fees, basing its decision on the prevailing rate in Madison, Wisconsin for lawyers specializing in similar work.

gold_text: Only a few fee-shifting statutes explicitly limit recoveries to actual outlays. For example, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act, 42 U.S.C. § 4654, will “reimburse” prevailing claimants for attorney’s fees “actually incurred” in litigating condemnation proceedings brought by the government. See United States v. 122.00 Acres of Land, 856 F.2d 56, 58 (8th Cir.1988). Similarly, the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), authorizes monetary recovery for attorney’s fees “incurred” as a result of unjustified federal action, see TGS Int’l, Inc. v. United States, 983 F.2d 229, 230 (Fed.Cir.1993); United States v. Paisley, 957 F.2d 1161, 1164 (4th Cir.1992), and an analogous statute contained in the Internal Revenue Code permits recovery of attorney’s fees “paid” or “incurred” in successful challenges to tax related actions, 26 U.S.C. § 7430(c)(1)(B)(iii); see Marre v. United States, 38 F.3d 823, 828-29 (5th Cir.1994). These three statutes, all of which aim to check or deter unjustified governmental conduct, permit parties to be reimbursed for fees actually incurred in achieving victory. But cf. Raney v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 222 F.3d 927, 934 (Fed.Cir.2000) (en banc) (citing the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, and Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(4) as examples in which “the courts have neither interpreted the ‘incurred’ term ... to restrict or limit the payment of fees to those actually incurred, nor prevented market rate fees from being awarded”).
