C.
Beyond the initial arguments, the defense of qualified immunity also warrants dismissal. As noted in the case of Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights (Id. at 815-818). The current allegations fail to show that the individual IRS officials contravened any clearly established legal principles or acted beyond the scope of their duties. Consequently, their actions fall within the protective ambit of qualified immunity.

Regarding plaintiff's claim under 26 U.S.C. ยง 7431(a)(1), the court in Windsor v. The Tennessean, 719 F.2d 155, underscored the necessity of established legal criteria for actionable disclosures (Id. at 160). Herein, the letter in question does not meet the threshold of prohibited disclosure under ยง 6103(a), as it neither divulges sensitive return information nor associates Mid-South with specific taxpayer investigations. The absence of explicit statutory violations or governmental overreach solidifies the individual defendants' immunity from suit.

Given the lack of a viable claim under the presented counts and the applicability of qualified immunity, the motion to dismiss is accordingly well-founded.

Therefore, the motion for dismissal on account of failure to state a claim is GRANTED, and this case is hereby DISMISSED.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
