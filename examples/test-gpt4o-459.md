In examining whether the Annuity qualifies as an "individual retirement annuity" under § 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, we find support from relevant case law. In 544 U.S. 320, the Court interpreted similar retirement instruments to be aligned with the debtor's claimed exemptions if they share the primary purpose of enabling retirement savings, even if the mechanisms differ. Here, the Annuity was purchased via direct rollover from another tax-qualified IRA, thereby retaining its exempt status under § 408 despite having a single, fixed premium.

Furthermore, referencing 930 F.2d 630, where the court held that tax refunds lost their character as earnings when forwarded to the government, it can be inferred that rollover funds would not lose their tax-exempt status when maintaining continuous compliance with § 408 requirements. Thus, the rollover IRA annuity retains its exempt status, as the restrictive provisions on additional payments do not negate the established tax benefits tied to its original structure.

Therefore, given the clear legislative intent and judicial interpretations, we affirm the Bankruptcy Court’s decision that the Annuity complies with § 408 of the Internal Revenue Code and is exempt under § 522(b)(3)(C) of the Bankruptcy Code.
