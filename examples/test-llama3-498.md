In determining the proper venue for a bankruptcy case, courts have considered factors such as the convenience of the parties, the interest of justice, and the desirability of having the suit tried in a court in the state whose law will govern the case. In Reference Case 27 B.R. 871, the court held that venue was proper in the bankruptcy court where the main bankruptcy case was pending, citing 28 U.S.C. ยง 1473(a). However, the court also noted that certain collection suits by a debt-or are excluded from this rule in the interest of fairness to the defendants, citing 28 U.S.C. ยง 1473(b).

In Reference Case 7 B.R. 154, the court considered the application of 28 U.S.C. ยง 1473(d), which provides that a trustee may commence a proceeding arising under title 11 or arising in or related to a case under title 11 based on a claim arising after the commencement of such case from the operation of the business of the debtor only in the bankruptcy court for the district where a State or Federal court sits in which, under applicable nonbankruptcy venue provisions, an action on such claim may have been brought.

In the present case, the court must consider the applicability of this provision to the turnover proceeding brought by the trustee against the defendants. The court notes that the defendants have not filed an appellate brief in this case, and therefore, we infer that they agree to the consideration of subsection (d) only. The court concludes that the turnover proceeding is a "claim arising from the operation of the business" within the meaning of section 1473(d), and therefore, venue is proper in the bankruptcy court for the district where a State or Federal court sits in which, under applicable nonbankruptcy venue provisions, an action on such claim may have been brought.

In conclusion, the court holds that the turnover proceeding is properly before the bankruptcy court for the district where a State or Federal court sits in which, under applicable nonbankruptcy venue provisions, an action on such claim may have been brought, citing 28 U.S.C. ยง 1473(d). The court's decision is consistent with the principles of convenience, justice, and fairness that underlie the bankruptcy venue provisions.

Section 1473(d), on the other hand, reflects a concern that normal post-petition business relations between a debtor and other parties not be unnecessarily disturbed by the fact of the debtor's pending bankruptcy case.
