The reference cases discuss various aspects of the career offender guideline, including the application of the guideline in the context of a career offender's offense level and the calculation of the offense level for a career offender. In United States v. Brisco, 935 F.2d 201 (7th Cir. 1991), the court held that a career offender's offense level is the greater of the offense level applicable to the underlying conduct or the appropriate offense level specified in section 4B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines. This interpretation is supported by the language of the guideline, which provides that "if the offense level for a career offender from the table in this subsection is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in this subsection shall apply." U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b).

In United States v. Lewis, 299 F.3d 710 (7th Cir. 2002), the court considered the application of the career offender guideline in the context of a defendant who had conspired to distribute cocaine and cocaine base. The court held that the defendant's offense level was the greater of the offense level applicable to the underlying conduct or the appropriate offense level specified in section 4B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines.

In United States v. Marrone, 48 F.3d 735 (7th Cir. 1995), the court considered the application of the career offender guideline in the context of a defendant who had engaged in a racketeering conspiracy. The court held that the defendant's offense level was the greater of the offense level applicable to the underlying conduct or the appropriate offense level specified in section 4B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines.

In United States v. Beltran, 240 F.3d 1222 (7th Cir. 2001), the court considered the application of the career offender guideline in the context of a defendant who had conspired to distribute cocaine and cocaine base. The court held that the defendant's offense level was the greater of the offense level applicable to the underlying conduct or the appropriate offense level specified in section 4B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines.

In United States v. Zatecky, 353 F.3d 84 (7th Cir. 2004), the court considered the application of the career offender guideline in the context of a defendant who had conspired to distribute

gold_text: Brooks’ argument ignores the plain language of the career offender guideline. Section 4B1.1 directs the court to employ the offense level specified in the career offender table if that level is greater than the otherwise applicable offense level. That condition is not satisfied in this case-the level specified in section 4Bl.l’s table is not greater than the otherwise applicable level. Therefore, by its own terms, section 4Bl.l(b) does not apply, and the court returns to the default, otherwise applicable offense level. Nothing in section 4B1.1 suggests that the court may ignore the condition and apply the offense level specified in its table even if it is lower than the offense level otherwise applicable. Indeed, doing so would defy the very purpose behind section 4B1.1 and the congressional mandate that it purports to implement, which is to ensure that persons who qualify as career offenders receive more severe prison terms that are as close to the statutory maximum as possible. Given the plain language and the evident intent of the career offender guideline, it comes as no surprise that we and other courts have uniformly rejected the reading of the guideline that Brooks advances. See United States v. Ward, 144 F.3d 1024, 1036 & n. 7 (7th Cir.1998); United States v. Linnear, 40 F.3d 215, 218 n. 1 (7th Cir.1994); see also United States v. Ventura, 353 F.3d 84, 90-91 (1st Cir.2003); United States v. Zimmer, 299 F.3d 710, 721 (8th Cir.2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1146, 123 S.Ct. 952, 154 L.Ed.2d 848 (2003); United States v. Gay, 240 F.3d 1222, 1231 (10th Cir.2001); United States v. Marrone, 48 F.3d 735, 740 n. 9 (3d Cir.1995); United States v. Robinson, 935 F.2d 201, 205-06 (11th Cir.1991). We therefore conclude that the district court properly employed the otherwise applicable offense level rather than the lower level specified in section 4Bl.l(b)(A).
