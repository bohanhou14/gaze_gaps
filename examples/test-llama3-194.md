The defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted. The court finds that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity for the arrests on February 9, 1989, and March 21, 1989. The court concludes that the officers had a reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause to arrest Steiner.

In reaching this conclusion, the court relies on the analysis in Burnett v. Grattan, 468 U.S. 42 (1984), which states that "the predominance of the federal interest" in the borrowing process should be emphasized. Similarly, in Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261 (1985), the court held that a state's personal injury statute of limitations should be applied to all § 1983 claims.

The court also finds that the malicious prosecution claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The court holds that the dismissals in the interest of justice do not constitute a favorable termination, citing Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff, 63 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 1995).

Finally, the court concludes that the defendants did not waive the statute of limitations defense by failing to raise it earlier. The court relies on the analysis in 488 U.S. 235 (1988), which states that a party has a right to raise a statute of limitations defense at any time before judgment.

In conclusion, the defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted. The court finds that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, the malicious prosecution claims are barred by the statute of limitations, and the defendants did not waive the statute of limitations defense.
