The Double Jeopardy clause poses no bar in this case, as the Double Jeopardy clause prohibits a second trial for the same offense after the defendant has been acquitted, and not the other way around. United States v. Garcia, 562 F.2d 411, 416 (7th Cir.1977). Therefore, the Double Jeopardy clause does not preclude this court from entertaining an appeal of the government's conviction.

Regarding the admission of evidence, the district court did not err in admitting the evidence. The evidence was relevant and probative, and the court gave the jury a limiting instruction to prevent any unfair prejudice. United States v. Marks, 816 F.2d 1207 (7th Cir.1987). Additionally, the evidence was admissible under Rule 404(b) as it was directed towards establishing a matter in issue other than the defendant's propensity to commit the crime charged. United States v. Shackleford, 738 F.2d 776, 779 (7th Cir.1984).

Regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, the evidence at trial was sufficient to establish that the defendant Harley Surratt was a member of the conspiracy charged in the indictment. United States v. Douglas, 874 F.2d 1145, 1151 (1989). The evidence was sufficient to support a jury finding that Surratt knowingly and intentionally joined the conspiracy. United States v. Xheka, 704 F.2d 974, 987 (1983).

The motion for severance was properly denied as the joinder was constitutional and the defendants were not prejudiced. United States v. Kendall, 665 F.2d 135, 137 (7th Cir.1981). The defendants' claims of prejudice were unfounded and the court did not err in denying their motion.

In conclusion, the convictions are affirmed. The evidence was sufficient to support the verdict, and the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence or denying the motion for severance. United States v. Darrell, 629 F.2d 1089 (5th Cir.1980).

gold_text: Defendant Penson contends that he was unduly prejudiced by the trial court’s refusal to sever his trial from that of Harley Surratt. He also argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Both of these arguments are based on Penson’s assertion that his activities were unconnected, in time and in manner, to those of Harley Surratt and to the rest of the conspiracy. A decision not to sever the trials of co-defendants is one within the sound discretion of the trial court and should be overturned only if it is found to be a clear abuse of discretion. United States v. Percival, 756 F.2d 600, 610 (7th Cir.1985). The standard of review of a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 is “whether at the time of the motion there was relevant evidence from which the jury could reasonably find [the defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt_” United States v. Blasco, 581 F.2d 681, 684 (7th Cir.1978), certiorari denied, 439 U.S. 966, 99 S.Ct. 456, 58 L.Ed.2d 425.
