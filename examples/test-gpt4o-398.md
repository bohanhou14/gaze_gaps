To resolve whether the jury instructions violated Torres’s due process rights by impermissibly shifting the burden of proof, we follow the AEDPA framework. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), we first assess whether the state court's decision was "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States" (145 F.3d 16). The Supreme Court’s precedents in jury instruction matters, such as in Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510 (1979), establish that due process is violated if jury instructions create a mandatory presumption that shifts the burden of proof to the defendant (471 U.S. 307).

We scrutinize the instructions given by the trial judge to determine if they created such a presumption. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's analysis relied heavily on federal law, specifically examining whether the jury instructions included any elements that could absolve the state of its burden to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

In this case, the state court concluded that the instructions, taken as a whole, did not mislead the jury or relieve the state of its burden. The habeas court must defer to this judgment unless it appears unreasonable in light of the evidence presented (471 U.S. 307). Our independent review confirms that the state court’s decision did not unreasonably apply federal law or rely on determinations inconsistent with Supreme Court precedents.

Therefore, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of Torres’s habeas petition, finding no due process violation in the jury instructions given during his trial.

CONCLUSION
The jury instructions did not shift the burden of proof in violation of Torres’s due process rights. The district court’s dismissal of the habeas petition is affirmed.

gold_text: First, we must determine whether “the Supreme Court has prescribed a rule that governs the petitioner’s claim.” O’Brien v. Dubois, 145 F.3d 16, 24 (1st Cir.1998). If so, we analyze whether the state court decision is “contrary to” that prescribed rule. See id. “To obtain relief ... [the] petitioner must show that Supreme Court precedent requires an outcome contrary to that reached by the relevant state court.” Id. at 24-25. Because we agree with the parties that Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985), provides the governing rule, our discussion centers on that Supreme Court case.
