We next address Alamo’s cross-appeal, challenging the district court’s denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity. Alamo contends it is an arm of the State of Texas and thus entitled to immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. However, the district court, applying the “arm-of-the-state” analysis from Clark v. Tarrant County, 798 F.2d 736 (5th Cir. 1986), concluded that Alamo is not entitled to such immunity. This mirrors the situation in 243 F.3d 936, where the court similarly conducted an “arm-of-the-state” analysis and found that the entity was not immune under the Eleventh Amendment.

We review this determination de novo, as established in Champagne v. Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, 188 F.3d 312 (5th Cir. 1999). The Eleventh Amendment provides immunity to states against suits by citizens of another state or foreign citizens, yet this immunity is not extended to entities that do not qualify as an arm of the state. 

Given that the district court's determination that Alamo is not an arm of the state aligns with precedent, and noting the absence of clear error in applying the relevant legal framework, we dismiss Alamo’s appeal on this ground. Similarly, Alamo’s request for attorney’s fees, arising purely from its claimed immunity, is moot.

In sum, the district court’s denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity to Alamo is affirmed, and their appeal seeking relief based on this ground is dismissed.

gold_text: Alamo cross-appeals the district court’s denial of its motion to dismiss on grounds of Alamo’s Eleventh Amendment immunity. Martin argues that we are precluded from considering the merits of this issue because Alamo did not file a timely notice of appeal. We need not decide whether Alamo’s notice of appeal was timely because Alamo inadequately briefed the issue and, thus, abandoned its Eleventh Amendment arguments. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. City of El Paso, 243 F.3d 936, 940 (5th Cir.2001) (dismissing appeal as abandoned because the Appellant failed to challenge the district court’s application of the applicable test for Eleventh Amendment immunity); Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., 985 F.2d 824, 831 (5th Cir.0993); L & A Contracting Co. v. Southern Concrete Servs., 17 F.3d 106, 113 (5th Cir.1994)(holding appeal to be abandoned because appellant cited no authority in a one-page argument); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (requiring argument to contain “appellant’s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies”). The appeal on this issue is DISMISSED.
