Petitioner also alleges procedural unfairness due to the SEC’s refusal to produce certain documents and statements critical for cross-examining witnesses, thereby impeding their ability to challenge the credibility of the Commission’s evidence. As established in 258 F.2d 403, the refusal to compel the production of a statement in the possession of a witness can significantly prejudice the defense, particularly when it involves the credibility of a crucial witness. In the present case, similar to the cited precedent, the SEC's withholding of these documents constituted a procedural error impacting the fairness of the proceedings against Holman.

Moreover, referring to 353 U.S. 657, the importance of access to reports and statements for impeachment purposes during cross-examination cannot be overstated. The ability to challenge the memory and veracity of key witnesses is central to a fair adjudicatory process. Here, the SEC's denial undermined Holman's opportunity to inspect potentially conflicting or inconsistent witness statements which could have bolstered the defense's argument and strategy.

These procedural deficiencies, as objected by the petitioner, align with recognized standards of fairness and proper examination during legal proceedings, thereby suggesting a significant procedural lapse that may warrant reconsideration of the SEC's adjudicatory actions against Holman.

gold_text: As to the entries made on petitioner’s books by Klapper, a staff witness who was petitioner’s cashier at the time the entries were made, it is hard to see how they were a “statement” which the SEC was required to divulge under the Jencks case, see NLRB v. Adhesive Products Corp., 258 F.2d 403 (2d Cir. 1958). Nor was it prejudicial error for the SEC to rule with respect to a statement of a witness obtained during investigation that petitioner’s counsel could examine the statement only in the presence of the hearing examiner or of a staff member and could not make copies of it, though he could examine it at length and ask for a recess to examine it. This ruling did not unduly impair counsel’s ability to use prior statements of witnesses for purposes of impeachment — the rationale underlying Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957).
