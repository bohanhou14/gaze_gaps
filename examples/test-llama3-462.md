In discussing the jurisdictional issues in the context of legal cases, it is essential to consider the precedents set by the Supreme Court. Two notable cases are 317 U.S. 249 and 281 U.S. 222, which have contributed to the understanding of the twilight zone in which employees must have their rights determined on a case-by-case basis.

In 317 U.S. 249, the Court emphasized the importance of considering the actual administration and the statutory exemptions. The Court held that Congress has accepted the Jensen line of demarcation between state and federal jurisdiction, and that the determination of the margin becomes no simpler because the standard applied is considered to be embedded in a statute rather than in the Constitution.

Similarly, in 281 U.S. 222, the Court acknowledged the existence of a twilight zone where employees must have their rights determined on a case-by-case basis. The Court noted that the Federal Employers’ Liability Act and the Safety Appliance Act are not applicable to employees who are injured while working on navigable waters.

In the context of the present case, it is crucial to consider the precedents set by these cases. The plaintiff, a freight brakeman, was injured while working on a car float moored in navigable waters. The defendant has conceded that the plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a freight brakeman at the Harsimus Cove yards of the defendant at Jersey City, New Jersey, and that the plaintiff’s accident occurred on navigable waters.

In light of these facts, it appears that the present case falls within the twilight zone where employees must have their rights determined on a case-by-case basis. The Court must give great weight to the conclusions of the appropriate federal authorities and the state statutes themselves.

In conclusion, the present case presents a complex jurisdictional issue that requires consideration of the precedents set by the Supreme Court. The cases of 317 U.S. 249 and 281 U.S. 222 highlight the importance of determining the twilight zone in which employees must have their rights determined on a case-by-case basis. The Court must carefully consider the actual administration, statutory exemptions, and precedents set by the Supreme Court to determine the jurisdictional issues in the present case.

gold_text: The brief for the plaintiff suggests that the Nogueira case is capable of being distinguished because the plaintiff there was a freight handler (“longshoreman”), whereas in the case at bar he is a brakeman (“railroader”). I think what plaintiff’s counsel really hints at is that the traditional maritime tort-jurisdiction test (locality) has become outmoded, and that the nature of the employment should be a substitute or perhaps an alternative test. In fact, plaintiff cites Davis v. De partment of Labor and Industries of the State of Washington, 1942, 317 U.S. 249, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246, as pointing the way to a twilight zone in the decisions and a “case by case” technique, 317 U.S. 249, 256, 63 S.Ct. 225, 229, 87 L.Ed. 246. But there is nothing in the 1939 amendment to suggest that Congress was changing the locality test found in the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act. As for the Davis case, the Supreme Court there found itself dealing with another complication arising from the “maritime but local” doctrine by which it had attempted to retreat from the harshness of the Jensen case prior to the enactment of the federal compensation act. Mr. Justice Black cites many of these “maritime but local” decisions in a footrSte in Davis, 317 U.S. 249, 253, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246. But although that footnote mentions Nogueira, as does the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the dissent of Mr. Chief Justice Stone, I find no suggestion in the Nogueira opinion that it was in any way affected by the “maritime but local” exception. Indeed one of the leading decisions, Baizley Iron Works v. Span, 1930, 281 U.S. 222, 50 S.Ct. 306, 74 L.Ed. 819, where the nature of employment (“local”) test was vainly invoked to escape the Jensen decision, came down on the very same day as the Nogueira decision (April 14, 1930). Nowhere in Nogueira is the Baizley decision spoken of; nowhere in Baizley is Nogueira mentioned. Justices Holmes, Stone and Brandéis dissented in Baizley, but they concurred in Nogueira.
