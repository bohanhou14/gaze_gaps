The case at hand involves Scottie Pippen, a former NBA player who is suing multiple defendants for defamation and false light invasion of privacy after they published false reports that he had filed for bankruptcy. The district court dismissed the complaint, finding that the defendants did not publish the statements with actual malice.

In Illinois, there are two types of defamation: defamation per quod, which requires a plaintiff to show that the false statements caused him harm, and defamation per se, which is actionable without proof of injury. The court found that the statements at issue did not fit within any of the categories of statements recognized by Illinois law to be so innately harmful that damages may be presumed.

The court also concluded that the complaint did not plausibly allege that the defendants had published the falsehoods with actual malice, which is a requirement for a public figure such as Pippen to recover damages for defamation. The court cited Firth v. State, 184 Misc.2d 105, 706 N.Y.S.2d 835, 843 (N.Y.Ct.CI.2000), and Nationwide Bi-Weekly Admin., Inc. v. Belo Corp., 512 F.3d 137, 144 (5th Cir.2007), which held that the single publication rule applies to information widely available on the Internet.

The court also noted that the defendants had many ways to learn whether Pippen had filed for bankruptcy, including searching the federal courts' PACER service and asking Pippen himself. The court cited Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 688, 109 S.Ct. 2678, 105 L.Ed.2d 562 (1989), which held that failure to investigate is insufficient to establish reckless disregard for the truth.

In conclusion, the court found that the defendants did not publish the statements with actual malice and that the single publication rule applies to the Internet. The court also noted that the defendants had many ways to learn whether Pippen had filed for bankruptcy and that failure to investigate is insufficient to establish reckless disregard for the truth.
