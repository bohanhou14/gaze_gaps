The burden of proof in granting summary judgment is to determine whether the nonmoving party has presented a genuine issue of material fact. In the case at hand, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant regarded him as a person with a disability, which is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2).

The defendant has argued that the plaintiff was not regarded as a person with a disability because he was not perceived as being substantially limited in his major life activities. The plaintiff, on the other hand, has argued that the defendant regarded him as a person with a disability because of the comments made by his co-workers.

In this regard, the court finds that the plaintiff has not presented a genuine issue of material fact. The comments made by the co-workers, while potentially discriminatory, are not probative evidence of the defendant's intent or perception of the plaintiff's disability. See Mulero-Rodríguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 675-76 (1st Cir.1996). Furthermore, the defendant's actions in temporarily reassigning the plaintiff's duties were based on a legitimate concern for the safety of the passengers and crew, rather than any discriminatory intent. See Abbott v. Bragdon, 163 F.3d 87, 88 (1st Cir.1998).

Accordingly, the court finds that the defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination. See Sullivan v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 358 F.3d 110, 2004 WL 259069, (1st Cir.2004).

In conclusion, the court finds that the plaintiff has not presented a genuine issue of material fact and that the defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination. The court's decision is based on the facts of this case and the applicable law, including 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2), Mulero-Rodríguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 675-76 (1st Cir.1996), and Abbott v. Bragdon, 163 F.3d 87, 88 (1st Cir.1998).

gold_text: The summary judgment standard, under Fed.R.Civ.P.56, provides that the court should grant summary judgment “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issues as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. R. 56(c). In Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), the Supreme Court held that the party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden demonstrating that no genuine issue as to a material fact exists. A contested fact is “material” when it has the potential to change the outcome of the case. Vega-Rodríguez v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., 110 F.3d 174, 178 (1st Cir.1997). There is no genuine issue for trial when the record, taken as a whole, could not lead a trier of fact to find for the non-moving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-87, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).
