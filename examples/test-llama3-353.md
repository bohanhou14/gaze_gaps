In conclusion, we determine that the New Jersey statute's anti-redlining provisions are valid and applicable to national banks. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act does not preclude state regulation of redlining, and the McClellan v. Chipman test does not apply in this case. The Comptroller of the Currency has the authority to enforce the anti-redlining provisions against national banks, and state officials do not have the power to issue cease and desist orders.

In reaching this conclusion, we rely on the principle of dual control, where both federal and state governments have concurrent jurisdiction over national banks. The federal government has the authority to regulate national banks, but states also have the power to regulate them in areas that are not preempted by federal law. The anti-redlining provisions of the New Jersey statute are not preempted by federal law, and therefore, state officials can enforce them against national banks.

The reference cases cited in this write-up support our conclusion. In Reference Case 199 U.S. 148, the Supreme Court held that states have the power to regulate national banks in areas that are not preempted by federal law. In Reference Case 591 F.2d 182, the court held that federal agencies have the authority to enforce federal laws against national banks.

In conclusion, the New Jersey statute's anti-redlining provisions are valid and applicable to national banks. The Comptroller of the Currency has the authority to enforce these provisions against national banks, and state officials do not have the power to issue cease and desist orders.

gold_text: It is not clear just what “visitorial” powers include, although generally they do encompass examination of the bank’s books and records. A few notable exceptions are that a stockholder of the bank may inspect its records to determine the value of the stock, Guthrie v. Harkness, 199 U.S. 148, 157-59, 26 S.Ct. 4, 7, 50 L.Ed. 130 (1905), and the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission likewise may investigate bank records for matters within those agencies’ purview, Peoples Bank of Danville v. Williams, 449 F.Supp. 254, 158-60 (D.Va.1978); FTC v. Rockefeller, 441 F.Supp. 234, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 1977), aff’d, 591 F.2d 182 (2d Cir. 1979). Enforcement of the antiredlining statute no doubt would require examination of bank records. We need not meet the Comptroller’s interpretative ruling in all respects but, in the circumstances of this case, exclusivity of the power to examine is a reasonable interpretation of the National Bank Act.
