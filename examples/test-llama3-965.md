In the case of Howell v. United States, the plaintiff, a former Lieutenant in the United States Navy, was dismissed from the service after being convicted by a general court-martial. The plaintiff claims that his dismissal was improper and without warrant of law due to various constitutional violations, including denial of due process and the right to a speedy trial.

The plaintiff argues that his arrest on February 28, 1946, was not a formal arrest for trial, as he was not furnished with a true copy of the charges and specifications. However, the stipulation of facts filed by the parties reveals that the plaintiff was present at the hearings of the Board of Investigation, was read the convening order, and was represented by counsel at said hearings. In addition, the plaintiff was served with a copy of the charges and specifications on June 28, 1946, which is considered the arrest for trial contemplated by Article 43 of the Articles for the Government of the Navy.

The plaintiff also claims that his trial was unfair due to the delay between his arrest and trial, which exceeded four months. However, the delay was justified by the circumstances of the case, including the need for further investigation and the complexity of the charges.

The court has held that the military law is due process for those in the military or naval service of the United States, and that the decision of a military tribunal acting within the scope of its lawful powers cannot be reviewed or set aside by the courts (Reaves v. Ainsworth, 219 U.S. 296, 304). The court has also held that errors in procedure can be corrected only by the proper military authorities (Hiatt v. Brown, 339 U.S. 103).

In conclusion, the plaintiff's claims of constitutional violations have been considered and rejected. The court has held that the military law is due process and that the decision of a military tribunal acting within the scope of its lawful powers cannot be reviewed or set aside by the courts. The delay between the plaintiff's arrest and trial was justified by the circumstances of the case, and the plaintiff was furnished with a true copy of the charges and specifications at the time of his arrest for trial.
