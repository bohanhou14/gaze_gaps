Arch Trading challenges its conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 371, alleging that the conspiracy charge was defective and that the government's choice of invoking the "offense" clause rather than the "defraud" clause was improper. However, the court finds that the evidence would have supported conviction under either clause, and the government's discretion in choosing the "offense" clause was appropriate.

Arch Trading also contends that its conviction under the IEEPA is invalid due to the delegation of authority to the President to define criminal conduct. However, the court finds that the IEEPA meets the standard of constraint applied in Touby v. United States, as it defines the specific circumstances in which the President may act and limits his authority to meeting a foreign threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.

The court further finds that the executive orders and implementing regulations, including Part 575 of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations, are not void for vagueness, as they define the prohibited conduct with sufficient definiteness that an ordinary person could understand what conduct was prohibited.

Finally, Arch Trading challenges its conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1001, alleging that its misrepresentation to the Treasury Department's OFAC did not influence any governmental decision and that the OFAC did not have jurisdiction to issue a license. However, the court finds that the false statement was material to a matter within the jurisdiction of the agency, and that the prompting of official action is not an element of a § 1001 offense.

In conclusion, the court affirms Arch Trading's conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 371, the IEEPA, and 18 U.S.C. § 1001, citing the following reference cases: 755 F.2d 362, 322 F.2d 523, and Touby v. United States, 111 S.Ct. 1752.

gold_text: Arch Trading also claims, relying on its other § 1001 arguments, that the determination that Arch Trading’s misrepresentation was material was tainted by inadequate instructions to the jury on the question of materiality. In the context of § 1001, however, we have consistently held that “materiality is a question of law to be determined by the trial judge.” See Norris, 749 F.2d at 1121; accord Nilson Van & Storage Co. v. Marsh, 755 F.2d 362, 367 (4th Cir.1985); United States v. Ivey, 322 F.2d 523, 529 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 953, 84 S.Ct. 444, 11 L.Ed.2d 313 (1963). There was, therefore, no reversible error in failing to clarify that issue for the jury.
