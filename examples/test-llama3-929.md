The cases provided are crucial for understanding the legal implications of the references. Based on the analysis, it is clear that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has a duty to develop the record fully and fairly, even if the claimant is represented by counsel (Boyd v. Sullivan, 960 F.2d 733, 736 (8th Cir.1992)). This duty is essential in ensuring that deserving claimants receive justice (Sears v. Bowen, 840 F.2d 394, 402 (7th Cir.1988)).

In the case of Battles, the ALJ failed to fully develop the record, especially regarding his mental impairment (Lashley v. Secretary of Health & Human Serv., 708 F.2d 1048, 1052 (6th Cir.1983)). The ALJ's hearing lasted only ten minutes, and counsel's questions did not shed light on Battles' mental capacity to work (Lashley, 708 F.2d at 1052). This superficial questioning can lead to inaccurate portrayals of the claimant's limitations (Cannon v. Harris, 651 F.2d 513, 519 (7th Cir.1981)).

The Secretary's own rules recognize the importance of thoroughness in evaluating mental impairments (Social Security Ruling (SSR) 85-15). The regulations provide a mandatory procedure to evaluate mental impairments, 20 C.F.R. § 416.920a, and for examination by a psychiatrist or psychologist when there is evidence of a mental impairment (20 C.F.R. § 416.903(e)).

In conclusion, the Secretary's failure to fully develop the record in Battles' case is a critical issue that must be addressed. The Secretary's duty to develop the record fully and fairly is essential in ensuring that deserving claimants receive justice. The cases provide a framework for understanding the legal implications of this duty and the importance of thoroughness in evaluating mental impairments.
