The court has to consider the tolling of the statutory time limit during the pendency of the plaintiff's IFP application and for a reasonable time thereafter. In Harris v. National Tea Co., 454 F.2d 307 (7th Cir. 1971), the court held that the filing of a motion for appointment of counsel serves to toll the statutory limitation until it is disposed of. Similarly, in this case, the plaintiff's IFP application was pending before the court until it was denied on March 1, 2011. Therefore, the statutory time limit was tolled during this period.

The court also has to consider the notice period after the denial of the IFP application. In Brown v. J.I. Case Co., 756 F.2d 48 (7th Cir.1985), the court held that the filing of an application for appointment of counsel along with a right-to-sue letter tolls the limitations period while the counsel request is pending. Similarly, in this case, the plaintiff's IFP application was pending before the court until it was denied, and the plaintiff did not receive notice of the denial until March 11, 2011. Therefore, the statutory time limit was tolled for a reasonable time after the denial of the IFP application.

In conclusion, the plaintiff's Complaint was timely filed, as the statutory time limit was tolled during the pendency of the IFP application and for a reasonable time thereafter. The court's denial of the IFP application did not toll the statutory time limit, as the plaintiff did not receive notice of the denial until March 11, 2011. The plaintiff's Complaint was filed on March 14, 2011, which is within the tolled statutory time limit.

gold_text: Despite the inconsistencies in the case law, the weight of authority supports tolling the statute of limitations not only for the pendency of an IFP application, but also for a reasonable period thereafter to account for receipt of notice of the court’s decision. In Okereh v. Winter, a case from this district, the court noted explicitly that “[ejquitable tolling applies between the day [plaintiff] filed his IFP application ... and the day he received the Court’s denial.” 600 F.Supp.2d at 142. In WilliamsGuice v. Board of Education of City of Chicago, the Seventh Circuit also suggested that the statute of limitations should “remain[ ] in suspension for a reasonable timeperhaps a time defined by local rules — after the district court’s order” on an IFP application. 45 F.3d at 165 (noting that the other possibility is: “Tough luck, that’s a consequence you accepted by waiting until the eleventh hour to file the complaint and seeking a dispensation to which you were not entitled.”); see also Harris v. Walgreen’s Distribution Ctr., 456 F.2d 588, 591 (6th Cir.1972) (noting that “courts construing Title VII have been extremely reluctant to allow procedural technicalities to bar claims brought under the Act” and finding that upon granting or denying a motion for appointment of counsel, the district judge “should set a reasonable time” within which the complaint must be filed); Mitcham v. Calderon, No. C 94-2854, 1996 WL 33322268, at *13 (N.D.Cal. Dec. 20, 1996) (“Accordingly, a motion for appointment of counsel should toll the statutory period. Further, the court should give the plaintiff a reasonable time after appointment of counsel to file suit.”) (internal citation omitted); Paulk v. Dept. of Air Force, Chanute Air Force Base, 830 F.2d 79, 83 (7th Cir.1987) (statute of limitations should be tolled during pendency of application and “for a reasonable time thereafter.”) (citing Harris, 456 F.2d at 591-92).
