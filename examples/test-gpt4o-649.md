In evaluating the legal principles of the case, we note similarities with established precedents. In the case 534 B.R. 400, the court underscored the necessity for reasonably equivalent value in fraudulent transfer claims under § 548(a)(1)(B). Here, the bankruptcy court's determination that the Deed of Trust was perfected on March 4, 2013, hinges on the debtor retaining sufficient rights in the Property for the lien to attach, which parallels the requirement for adequate value consideration at the time of transfer.

Additionally, the jurisdictional considerations align with those in case 326 B.R. 463. In both instances, proper procedural adherence, especially concerning timelines and the perfection of interests, was pivotal. Specifically, the court in 326 B.R. 463 recognized the relevance of the timing of jurisdictional motions under Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8002(b), reflecting the procedural integrity seen in our case with the timely filing of adversary proceedings and motions for summary judgment.

Thus, consistent application of these principles supports affirming the bankruptcy court’s ruling. By understanding the specific date of perfection and recognizing the legal standards for preferential transfers, the case is neatly summarized under established jurisprudence.
