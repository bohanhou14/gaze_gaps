In the context of the equal protection clause and Title IX, the issue of whether a qualified male can play on an all-girls athletic team raises important questions about the constitutionality of sex-based discrimination in athletic opportunities. In this case, the plaintiff, Donald Gomes, seeks to play on the all-girls volleyball team at Rogers High School, which is a violation of the Rhode Island Interscholastic League's rules.

The defendants argue that providing separate teams for females is a necessary step to overcome past athletic discrimination against women. They cite cases such as Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 97 S.Ct. 1192, 51 L.Ed.2d 360 (1977), which held that affirmative action programs aimed at overcoming past discrimination are constitutional.

However, the plaintiff argues that the constitution protects males as well as females against sex discrimination, citing cases such as Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976), and Orr v. Orr, - U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 1102, 59 L.Ed.2d 306 (1979).

The regulation promulgated under Title IX, 45 C.F.R. § 86.41(a), provides that "no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient." However, the regulation also allows for separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.

In this case, the plaintiff argues that the defendants' interpretation of the regulation is too broad and would allow for the exclusion of males from certain sports, such as volleyball, without equivalent female teams. This would be unconstitutional and in violation of the equal protection clause.

In conclusion, the issue of whether a qualified male can play on an all-girls athletic team raises important questions about the constitutionality of sex-based discrimination in athletic opportunities. The regulation promulgated under Title IX provides guidance on this issue, but its interpretation is subject to debate. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of each case.

gold_text: More troublesome is the drastic affirmative action remedy that defendants assert. To completely deny one sex any opportunity to participate in a federally funded activity from which either sex could benefit is an unprecedented doctrine. As previously stated, courts interpret the Constitution to permit “separate but equal” athletic teams; but, “separate but equal” necessarily envisions two equal systems, not an exclusive opportunity for only one sex to participate. See, e. g., Vorchheimer v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 532 F.2d 880 (3d Cir. 1976) aff’d without opinion 430 U.S. 703, 97 S.Ct. 1671, 51 L.Ed.2d 758 (1977) (separate sex high schools). Further, the constitution permits a disadvantaged race or sex to receive some preferential treatment, but no affirmative action program has gone so far as to absolutely bar the other race or sex from participation. See, e. g., Regents of University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978); Rhode Island Chapter, Assoc. of Gen. Contractors v. Kreps, 450 F.Supp. 338 (D.R.I. 1978).
