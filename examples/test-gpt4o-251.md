In considering whether the plaintiff's filing was timely after the Court's denial of his IFP application, it is instructive to look at multiple Circuit Court decisions. Notably, the Harris v. National Tea Co., 454 F.2d 307 (7th Cir. 1971) decision established that filing a motion for appointment of counsel tolls the statutory limitation until the motion is resolved, and this rationale can similarly apply to IFP applications (456 F.2d 588). Additionally, in Harris v. Walgreen's Distribution Center, 456 F.2d 588 (6th Cir. 1972), the court held that "the filing, processing and decision of the motion for counsel could consume the entire 30-day period," thus justifying tolling during this period and a reasonable time for the plaintiff to act thereafter.

Furthermore, the Sixth Circuit in Brown v. J.I. Case Co., 756 F.2d 48 (7th Cir.1985), and similar cases, reaffirm the equitable principle that tolling should account for a reasonable period post-decision to ensure plaintiffs have adequate time to file. Similar to our case, the courts in these references highlighted the importance of providing plaintiffs a reasonable notice period post-decision on IFP applications (830 F.2d 79). 

Applying these precedents, the tolling in this case should reasonably extend until the plaintiff's receipt of the Court's denial plus a presumptive notice period. Consequently, the plaintiff's filing on March 14, 2011, falls within the permissible statutory period, rendering the Complaint timely. Thus, the defendant's motion to dismiss is denied.

gold_text: Despite the inconsistencies in the case law, the weight of authority supports tolling the statute of limitations not only for the pendency of an IFP application, but also for a reasonable period thereafter to account for receipt of notice of the court’s decision. In Okereh v. Winter, a case from this district, the court noted explicitly that “[ejquitable tolling applies between the day [plaintiff] filed his IFP application ... and the day he received the Court’s denial.” 600 F.Supp.2d at 142. In WilliamsGuice v. Board of Education of City of Chicago, the Seventh Circuit also suggested that the statute of limitations should “remain[ ] in suspension for a reasonable timeperhaps a time defined by local rules — after the district court’s order” on an IFP application. 45 F.3d at 165 (noting that the other possibility is: “Tough luck, that’s a consequence you accepted by waiting until the eleventh hour to file the complaint and seeking a dispensation to which you were not entitled.”); see also Harris v. Walgreen’s Distribution Ctr., 456 F.2d 588, 591 (6th Cir.1972) (noting that “courts construing Title VII have been extremely reluctant to allow procedural technicalities to bar claims brought under the Act” and finding that upon granting or denying a motion for appointment of counsel, the district judge “should set a reasonable time” within which the complaint must be filed); Mitcham v. Calderon, No. C 94-2854, 1996 WL 33322268, at *13 (N.D.Cal. Dec. 20, 1996) (“Accordingly, a motion for appointment of counsel should toll the statutory period. Further, the court should give the plaintiff a reasonable time after appointment of counsel to file suit.”) (internal citation omitted); Paulk v. Dept. of Air Force, Chanute Air Force Base, 830 F.2d 79, 83 (7th Cir.1987) (statute of limitations should be tolled during pendency of application and “for a reasonable time thereafter.”) (citing Harris, 456 F.2d at 591-92).
