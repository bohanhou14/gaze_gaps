**Generation:**

The District Court's determination conflicts with established precedents regarding marine peril and salvage. In our view, the factual record does not support the trial judge's conclusion that there was no "reasonably to be apprehended" peril. As noted in The Freedom, 181 F.2d 895, “It is not necessary that there be danger immediately impending, but if the vessel is stranded so that it is subject to the potential danger of damage or destruction, she may well be a subject of salvage services.”

Furthermore, the classification of service as towage or salvage must be carefully examined. In 232 F.2d 750, the court distinguished between "simple" towage and salvage, noting that the latter involves a higher degree of service. The Fort Myers' services, being intensive and involving re-floating efforts, arguably qualify as salvage, a point that necessitates thorough factual inquiry.

Moreover, in 9 F. 50, it was established that a settlement for towage does not preclude a reclassification to salvage if services rendered meet salvage criteria. The Fort Myers' claim, therefore, should not be dismissed purely on contractual grounds without a detailed evaluation of the services rendered.

The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial consistent with these principles.
