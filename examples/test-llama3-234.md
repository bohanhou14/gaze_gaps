The plaintiff seeks to overturn the Nevada Supreme Court's denial of her petition for waiver of the requirement to graduate from an A.B.A.-approved law school. She argues that the denial was arbitrary and discriminatory, violating her equal protection and due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The defendants, including the Supreme Court of Nevada and its justices, move to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of judicial immunity.

The Supreme Court has consistently held that state courts and their judges are immune from suit in federal court, except in limited circumstances. See Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967). The Eleventh Amendment similarly bars suits against a state in federal court, unless the state has waived its immunity. See 604 F.2d 976 (1979).

In this case, the plaintiff's claims are based on the Nevada Supreme Court's denial of her petition for waiver, which is a judicial act. The court's decision was not a ministerial act, but rather a discretionary decision made after considering the plaintiff's application. See Ktsanes v. Underwood, 552 F.2d 740 (1977). As such, the justices of the Nevada Supreme Court are immune from suit under the doctrine of judicial immunity.

The plaintiff's claims are also barred by the doctrine of res judicata, as she has already had her day in court before the Nevada Supreme Court and has exhausted her administrative remedies. See 458 F.2d 1205 (1972). Therefore, the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint is granted, and the plaintiff's claims are dismissed with prejudice.

gold_text: There is a minority of cases that hold that judicial immunity applies to injunctive or other equitable relief, as well as money damages. MacKay v. Nesbett, 285 F.Supp. 498 (D.Alaska 1968), aff’d on other grounds 412 F.2d 846 (9th Cir. 1969); Town of Hopkins, S.C. v. Cobb, 466 F.Supp. 1215 (D.S.C.1979). The majority rule is to the contrary, however. Immunity from damages does not ordinarily bar equitable relief as well. Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975); Brown v. Supreme Court of Nevada, supra; Shipp v. Todd, 568 F.2d 133 (9th Cir. 1978); Sparks v. Duval County Ranch Co., Inc., 604 F.2d 976 (5th Cir. 1979); Wiesenfeld v. State of N. Y., 474 F.Supp. 1141 (S.D.N.Y. 1979); Law Students Civil Research Coun., Inc. v. Wadmond, 299 F.Supp. 117 (S.D.N.Y. 1969), aff’d 401 U.S. 154, 91 S.Ct. 720, 27 L.Ed.2d 749 (1971). In fact, it has been held specifically that state judges may be enjoined against the commission of acts that violate civil rights, even though the court as an entity may not be held liable under the Civil Rights Act. Erdmann v. Stevens, 458 F.2d 1205 (2nd Cir. 1972); Brown v. Supreme Court of Nevada, supra.
