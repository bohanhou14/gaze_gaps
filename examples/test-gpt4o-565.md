This Court further recognizes the key principles underpinning the treatment of executory contracts in bankruptcy cases as delineated in pivotal precedents. Specifically, in reference case 465 U.S. 513, the United States Supreme Court clarified that the rejection of an executory contract under 11 U.S.C. § 365(g)(1) equates to a breach retroactively effective to the date preceding the bankruptcy filing. This necessitates that claims emerging post-filing, stemming from such rejections, be managed through the bankruptcy claims process (11 U.S.C. § 502(g)).

Moreover, the interpretation of assumption requirements for executory contracts is illuminated in reference case 973 F.2d 1065. Here, the court emphasized that formal court approval is imperative for the assumption of executory contracts in alignment with section 365. Consequently, without such approval, any implied assumptions are invalid, aligning with the conclusion that recoupment of pre-petition overpayments indeed falls under the ambit of the ongoing contractual relationship defined by the Medicare Provider Agreement.

Additionally, in context to the argument by HHS for recouping pre-petition overpayments under the same transaction umbrella, reference case 973 F.2d 1065 reaffirms that the Medicare Provider Agreement inherently involves continuous transactions, thereby facilitating recoupment without necessitating automatic stay relief.

This amalgamation of case law underscores the validity of HHS's actions under both the contractual and bankruptcy frameworks, supporting the Court's decision to permit the recoupment process as consistent with the prevailing legal standards.
