**Generation:**

The plaintiffs additionally fail to demonstrate irreparable injury in the absence of injunctive relief. Drawing on the principles articulated in case 758 F.2d 669, the injury alleged must be both certain and great, not merely theoretical or feared to occur at some indefinite time. Here, plaintiffs have not sufficiently established that immediate harm will necessarily ensue if the ratification process proceeds as scheduled. 

Moreover, as noted in reference case 454 F.3d 290, a showing of irreparable harm is crucial for injunctive relief, particularly in the context of Establishment Clause violations. The court must identify a level of harm that unequivocally requires intervention. The plaintiffs’ complaints center around the adequacy of time to organize against the CBA, rather than any concrete, immediate detriment, thus failing to meet the high bar set for irreparable injury. Without a demonstrable and imminent threat of harm, the plaintiffs’ request for extraordinary relief cannot be justified.

In conclusion, given the plaintiffs’ failure to prove subject matter jurisdiction, likelihood of success on the merits, or irreparable harm, their motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction are denied.
