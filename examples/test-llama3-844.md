The matter before the Court is the State of Ohio’s Department of Youth Services’ (DYS) motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable to this proceeding under Bankruptcy Rule 7012(b)(1). The complaint alleges that DYS, as a governmental unit, is subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and that its sovereign immunity is waived under 11 U.S.C. § 106.

The Court has previously opined that the filing of a proof of claim by at least one agency of a state or municipality is sufficient to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit otherwise afforded to that state or municipality. In re St. Joseph’s Hospital, 103 B.R. 643 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1989). It is also well-established that the filing of a proof of claim by a state or municipality constitutes a voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and waives any element of immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. Clark v. Barnard, 108 U.S. 436, 447, 2 S.Ct. 878, 882-83, 27 L.Ed. 780 (1883); St. Joseph’s, supra, at 650; In re Windrush Assoc. II, 105 B.R. 195 (Bankr.D.Conn.1989).

In this case, the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services and Department of Taxation filed proofs of claims in the Debtor’s case. Therefore, the filing of the proofs of claims abrogated the State’s sovereign immunity. As held in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996), Congress’ attempt to abrogate state sovereign immunity was made unmistakably clear in the language of the statute, and sufficient authority was established.

DYS’s motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) is without merit and is denied. The Trustee’s complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, and DYS is subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court. The Court will proceed with the case and consider the merits of the Trustee’s complaint. Reference cases: 99 F.3d 194, 467 U.S. 69, 416 U.S. 232,

gold_text: Next it must determined whether dismissal of DYS as a co-defendant is warranted under Rule 12(b)(6). A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is a test of the plaintiffs cause of action as stated in the complaint, not a challenge to the plaintiffs factual allegations. Id. Thus this Court must assume that all allegations are true and dismiss the claim “only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations,” i.e., that the legal protections invoked do not provide relief for the conduct alleged. Sistrunk v. City of Strongsville, 99 F.3d 194, 197 (6th Cir.1996) (quoting Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984)); see also Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974); Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). In addition, “while liberal, this standard of review does require more than the bare assertion of legal conclusions.” Columbia Natural Resources, Inc. v. Tatum, 58 F.3d 1101, 1109-1110 (6th Cir.1995) (citing Allard v. Weitzman (In re DeLorean Motor Co.), 991 F.2d 1236, 1240 (6th Cir.1993)). “In practice, ‘a ... complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.’ ” Allard, 991 F.2d at 1240 (quoting Scheid v. Fanny Farmer Candy Shops, Inc., 859 F.2d 434, 436 (6th Cir.1988)); see also Ana Leon T. v. Federal Reserve Bank, 823 F.2d 928, 930 (6th Cir.) (per curiam) (holding that the statement of mere legal conclusions is not entitled to liberal Rule 12(b)(6);6794;6794 review), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 945, 108 S.Ct. 333, 98 L.Ed.2d 360 (1987).
