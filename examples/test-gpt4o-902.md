E. Sufficiency of Vaughn Index

Plaintiff challenges the adequacy of the DEA’s and the Customs Service’s indices submitted by the government pursuant to Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C.Cir.1973), and the FBI’s choice not to create a Vaughn index. An adequate Vaughn index is crucial as it forces the government to analyze carefully any material withheld, enables the trial court to determine the applicability of the exemption, and allows the requester to present their case effectively. See Lykins v. Dep't of Justice, 725 F.2d 1455, 1463 (D.C.Cir.1984); Vaughn, 484 F.2d at 827-828.

In this case, DEA’s and Customs Service’s indices were created following this principle, sufficiently categorized, detailed, and explained the reasons for withholding each document, thus meeting the requirement set forth in 830 F.2d 337. Each deletion was correlated specifically and unambiguously to the corresponding exemption, achieving transparency and enabling Cucci to challenge the withholdings effectively. Therefore, the Court finds the Vaughn indices submitted by the DEA and the Customs Service to be sufficient.

In contrast, the FBI did not produce a classic Vaughn index but followed an alternative method approved by precedent, using functional categories and coded deletions supported by detailed affidavits. Courts have upheld such methods as sufficient when they serve the purposes of a Vaughn index effectively. See National Treasury Employees Union v. U.S. Customs Service, 802 F.2d 525, 527 (D.C.Cir.1986); Branch, 658 F.Supp. at 206-07.

Given these considerations, the Court concludes that the Vaughn indices provided by the DEA and the Customs Service, as well as the alternative method used by the FBI, are adequate and meet the requirements established in the relevant case precedents.

gold_text: An agency typically must submit an index identifying the documents withheld and the statutory exemption claimed. An adequate Vaughn index facilitates the trial court’s duty of ruling on the applicability of certain invoked FOIA exemptions, gives the requester as much information as possible that he may use to present his case to the trial court and thus enables the adversary system to operate. Lykins v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 725 F.2d 1455, 1463 (D.C.Cir.1984). “[I]t is the function, not the form, of the index that is important.” Keys v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 830 F.2d 337, 349 (D.C.Cir.1987) (citations omitted). So long as the Vaughn index and supporting government affidavits are sufficiently specific to support the exemptions claimed, the agency need not submit an index with “a degree of detail that would reveal precisely the information that the agency claims it is entitled to withhold.” Id.
