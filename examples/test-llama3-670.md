In the context of the Tariff Act of 1930, the classification of timepiece movements is crucial to determine the appropriate duty rate. The complainant, an American manufacturer, protests the classification of certain timepiece movements as time-keeping, time-measuring, or time-indicating mechanisms, devices, or instruments under paragraph 367(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as modified. The complainant argues that these movements should be classified as clocks or clock movements under paragraph 368(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as modified.

The court has construed paragraph 367(h) to mean that the width of a movement shall be the shortest surface dimension through the center of the pillar or bottom plate, or its equivalent, not including in the measurement any portion thereof not essential to the functioning of the movement, mechanism, device, or instrument. (Reference case 2 Cust. Ct. 249 and 15 Cust. Ct. 124)

In the present case, the complainant's witnesses admit that the devices at bar do indicate the time of day, and the court finds that the provision in paragraph 367(a) is for time-keeping or time-indicating devices or instruments. The court also rules that the measurement of the pillar or bottom plates of timepieces covered by paragraph 367 has been the subject of consideration by this and the appellate court in several cases, which have been referred to by the parties in their briefs. (Reference case 22 Cust. Ct. 95)

The court concludes that the measurement called for by the statute, as it has been judicially construed, comes to the pillar plate itself, and does not include the synchronous motor or the shoulders of the pillar plate. This construction is consistent with the holding in Reference case 35 Cust. Ct. 183, where the court excluded from the width measurement of the watch movements the winding stems, for the reason that they are not essential to the functioning of the movement.

Therefore, based on the construction of paragraph 367(h) and the judicial precedents, the court holds that the timepiece movements at bar are properly classified as time-keeping, time-measuring, or time-indicating mechanisms, devices, or instruments under paragraph 367(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as modified. The court sustains the collector's classification and denies the protest.
