Upon reviewing the reference articles, I noticed that they all deal with legal cases related to habeas corpus, Atkins, and the Eighth Amendment. The cases involve intellectual disability, competency, and the application of federal laws.

In the case of Weathers v. Texas, --- U.S. ----, 137 S.Ct. 1039, 197 L.Ed.2d 416 (2017), the Supreme Court held that the Briseño factors "may not be used... to restrict qualification of an individual as intellectually disabled." Moore v. Texas, --- U.S. ----, 137 S.Ct. 1039, 197 L.Ed.2d 416 (2017). This decision was applied retroactively in the case of Shoop v. Hill, --- U.S. ----, 139 S. Ct. 504, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2019).

In another case, Davis v. Warden, 854 F.3d 967, the court held that the miscarriage-of-justice exception is inapplicable when a petitioner does not assert an actual-innocence claim. Additionally, the court noted that the Supreme Court has clearly established that a defendant must receive adequate notice of the charges against him. Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196, 201, 68 S.Ct. 614, 92 L.Ed. 644 (1948).

In the case of Hill v. Warden, 881 F.3d 483, the court considered the issue of intellectual disability and found that the Ohio Court of Appeals' determination was unreasonable. The court noted that the Supreme Court has clearly established that a defendant must receive adequate notice of the charges against him and that the Briseño factors may not be used to restrict qualification of an individual as intellectually disabled.

Overall, these cases demonstrate the importance of considering the application of federal laws in legal proceedings and the need for adequate notice of charges against a defendant. They also highlight the role of the Supreme Court in establishing precedents and guidelines for lower courts to follow.
