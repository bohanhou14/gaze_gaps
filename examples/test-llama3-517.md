In this case, the court is asked to consider a motion for a preliminary injunction brought by Sportswear against Fashions. Sportswear claims that Fashions' use of the name "Puritan" in connection with Beatle goods is causing confusion in the market and is likely to cause irreparable harm to Sportswear's reputation. However, the court finds that Sportswear has not established a likelihood of confusion, and that Fashions' use of the name "Puritan" is not likely to cause irreparable harm.

The court notes that Fashions has been using the name "Puritan" for many years, and that the name is not unique to Sportswear. The court also notes that the Beatle promotion is a highly specialized one, and that the primary sales appeal is not the garment itself, but the name and image of the Beatles. Therefore, the court finds that there is no likelihood of confusion between the goods sold by Fashions and those sold by Sportswear.

The court also notes that the evidence presented by Sportswear does not persuade it that the Beatle goods are inferior in quality or workmanship. Therefore, the court finds that Sportswear has not established a likelihood of irreparable harm.

In contrast, the court notes that the motion for a preliminary injunction is not likely to cause irreparable harm to Fashions. Fashions has invested large sums in the Beatle promotion, and is likely to suffer significant losses if the promotion is halted.

The court also notes that the issues in this case are complex and fact-sensitive, and that it would be premature to grant a preliminary injunction without fully exploring the issues through discovery.

Accordingly, the court denies Sportswear's motion for a preliminary injunction. The court also notes that Fashions has the right to continue its Beatle promotion, and that Sportswear has no right to prevent Fashions from using the name "Puritan" in connection with Beatle goods.

The court also notes that the stay of the action in California is not necessary, as the issues in that action can be raised by Fashions in a counterclaim in this case.

All the issues arising out of the controversy between the parties can and should be resolved in the action first started in this district. In the exercise of my discretion all further proceedings in the action commenced in the Southern District of California will be stayed pending the determination of the case at bar. See Kerotest Mfg.
