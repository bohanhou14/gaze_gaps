The Jones Act, which was enacted in 1915, granted seamen the right to maintain an action at law for damages for personal injuries, and abolished the affirmative defenses available to employers (61 U.S. 583). The Act also gave seamen the right to elect to proceed under the Jones Act or under the maritime law (Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, 264 U.S. 375, 44 S.Ct. 391, 68 L.Ed. 748).

The court also held that the venue provisions of the Jones Act do not apply to actions in admiralty, and that a seaman can proceed under the Jones Act in a district where the employer does not reside and does not have its principal office, by attaching the employer's property within the district (34 F.Supp. 541).
