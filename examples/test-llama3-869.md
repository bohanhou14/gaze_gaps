In the case at hand, the Debtor has failed to meet the requirements for confirmation of its plan under § 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtor has not demonstrated that the plan is feasible, and the Court finds that the plan is not likely to be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization.

As discussed in In re Monnier Bros., 755 F.2d 1336, the feasibility of a plan is determined by whether it offers a reasonable assurance of success. In this case, the Debtor has not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that its plan is feasible.

Furthermore, the Court finds that the Debtor has not met the requirements for cramdown under § 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtor has not demonstrated that the plan does not discriminate unfairly and is fair and equitable with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under the plan.

As discussed in In re Boston Post Rd. Ltd. P’ship, 21 F.3d 477, a plan may be found to be "fair and equitable" only if the allowed value of the claim is to be paid in full, or if the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such impaired class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property.

In this case, the Debtor has not demonstrated that the plan is fair and equitable with respect to CPC's Class 6 unsecured claim. The plan provides for the payment of CPC's claim in full, but it also provides for the retention of O'Neill's equity interests in the Debtor. This is not fair and equitable with respect to CPC's claim, and the plan is therefore not eligible for cramdown under § 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

In conclusion, the Debtor has failed to meet the requirements for confirmation of its plan under § 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code. The plan is not feasible and is not eligible for cramdown under § 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Court will therefore deny confirmation of the plan.

gold_text: Section 1129(a)(ll) requires that the plan is not likely to be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization. 11 U.S.C. § 1129(a)(11). The standard for whether a plan is feasible is “whether the plan offers a reasonable assurance of success. Success need not be guaranteed.” Kane v. Johns-Manville Corp. (In re Johns-Manville Corp.), 843 F.2d 636, 649 (2d Cir.1988). In making this determination, a “bankruptcy court has an obligation to scrutinize the plan carefully to determine whether it offers a reasonable prospect of success and is workable.” Monnier Bros. v. Monnier (In re Monnier Bros.), 755 F.2d 1336, 1341 (8th Cir.1985). Courts have considered the following factors to make such a determination: (1) the adequacy of the debtor’s capital structure; (2) the earning power of its business; (3) economic conditions; (4) the ability of the debtor’s management; (5) the probability of the continuation of the same management; and (6) any other related matters which determine the prospects of a sufficiently successful operation to enable performance of the provisions of the plan.
