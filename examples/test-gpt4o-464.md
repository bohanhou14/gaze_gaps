Plaintiffs' argument that failure to provide appropriate modes of settlement deprives the UN of its immunity is unfounded. The precedents clearly establish the deference owed to the Executive Branch's interpretation of treaties (see reference cases 525 U.S. 155, 622 F.3d 123, 560 U.S. 1). Specifically, 525 U.S. 155 emphasizes the necessity for uniformity under international treaties, while 622 F.3d 123 and 560 U.S. 1 underscore the substantial weight granted to the Executive's interpretation, particularly concerning international obligations.

The principle of absolute immunity under the CPIUN, as reaffirmed in Brzak, remains unaffected by allegations of non-compliance with section 29. As noted, the immunity provision under CPIUN art. II, § 2, remains unequivocal and unconditional in the absence of an express waiver, consistent with 525 U.S. 155 and 560 U.S. 1, both of which underline the importance of deference to treaty interpretations for the purposes of promoting consistent international diplomatic relations.

Therefore, in line with these well-established principles and given the lack of express waiver, the Defendants' immunity stands, necessitating the dismissal of Plaintiffs’ suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U.S. 155, 168, 119 S.Ct. 662, 142 L.Ed.2d 576 (1999)) (alteration in original); see also Swarna v. Al-Awadi, 622 F.3d 123, 133 (2d Cir.2010) (“[W]hile the interpretation of a treaty is a question of law for the courts, given the nature of the document and the unique relationships it implicates, the ‘Executive Branch’s’ interpretation of a treaty is entitled to great weight.’ ” (quoting Abbott v. Abbott, 560 U.S. 1, 15, 130 S.Ct. 1983, 176 L.Ed.2d 789 (2010))). For the reasons given above, the United States’ interpretation that the CPIUN’s grant of immunity is vitiated only by an express waiver of that immunity by the UN is reasonable. Here, where such an express waiver is absent, the UN and its subsidiary body MINUS-TAH are immune from suit.
