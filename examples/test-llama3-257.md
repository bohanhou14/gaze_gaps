When reviewing legal cases, it is essential to consider the relevant facts, rules, and precedents. In the case of reference 477 U.S. 317, the Supreme Court established the criteria for granting summary judgment, stating that the record must demonstrate "that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." (Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c))

In the case of reference 784 F.2d 577, the court held that a man's death by hanging himself was an intentionally self-inflicted injury, even though he did not intend to kill himself. The court applied Louisiana law, which defines intentional conduct as "where the actor entertained a desire to bring about the consequences that followed or where the actor believed that the result was substantially certain to follow." (Bazley v. Tortorich, 397 So.2d 475, 481 (La.1981))

The policy in question excluded losses resulting from intentionally self-inflicted injury, and the court held that the death was a result of such an injury. The court noted that the partial strangulation that the deceased had engaged in was an injury, even though it was self-inflicted. The court also analogized the case to a situation where someone brands their own forearm, intending to cause some harm but resulting in unintended consequences.

In conclusion, the review of legal cases requires consideration of relevant facts, rules, and precedents. The cases of reference 477 U.S. 317 and 784 F.2d 577 demonstrate the importance of applying legal criteria and precedents to determine the outcome of a case. The court's decision in the latter case, which held that the death was a result of an intentionally self-inflicted injury, highlights the need to carefully consider the language of the policy and the relevant legal precedents.

gold_text: The only case cited by Mrs. Sims that holds that partial strangulation is not an injury is Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. v. Tommie, 619 S.W.2d 199 (Tex. Civ.App.—Texarkana 1981, writ ref’d n.r.e.). That case, however, was in an entirely different procedural posture than the instant case. In Tommie, the Texas intermediate appellate court was reviewing a jury finding that partial strangulation did not constitute an injury under Texas law. The Texarkana court, constrained by its standard of review, held that “some probative evidence” introduced in the trial court tended to support the jury’s finding, which the appellate court was therefore required to affirm. Id. at 203. The record in the case at bar, however, does not raise any genuine issue of material fact, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Mrs. Sims. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Reid v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 784 F.2d 577, 578 (5th Cir.1986).
