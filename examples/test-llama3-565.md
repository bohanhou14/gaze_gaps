The legal cases referenced in this question are crucial in determining the validity of the Medicare program's recoupment of overpayments from a provider's claims for reimbursement. In the case of Bildisco v. Maier & Fried, 465 U.S. 513 (1984), the Supreme Court held that a debtor's rejection of an executory contract constitutes a breach of the contract that relates back to the date immediately preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition. This principle is relevant in understanding the Medicare program's recoupment of overpayments.

In the case of University Medical Center v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 973 F.2d 1065 (1992), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that an overpayment of Medicare funds in 1985 arose from a different transaction than claims for reimbursement in 1988. However, this case is distinguishable from the present situation, as the Medicare program's recoupment of overpayments is based on the principle of equitable recoupment, which is supported by the common law doctrine of recoupment.

In the case of In re B & L Oil Co., 782 F.2d 155 (1986), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a debtor's overpayment of oil royalties was subject to recoupment by the creditor, even though the payments were made under a contract that provided for advance payments based on estimates. This case supports the principle of equitable recoupment and is relevant in understanding the Medicare program's recoupment of overpayments.

In conclusion, the Medicare program's recoupment of overpayments from a provider's claims for reimbursement is supported by the principles of equitable recoupment and the common law doctrine of recoupment, as illustrated by the cases of Bildisco v. Maier & Fried, University Medical Center v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, and In re B & L Oil Co.
