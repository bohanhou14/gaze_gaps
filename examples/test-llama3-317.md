The court may issue a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) when a movant is faced with the possibility that irreparable injury will occur even before the hearing for a preliminary injunction required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a) can be held. Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(b)(1). The purpose of a TRO is to maintain the status quo of a case until the court has an opportunity to hear a request for fuller relief. Id.

In this case, the plaintiffs have not shown irreparable injury. They claim that the APWU will violate their right to a “fully informed and meaningful vote” unless the Court directs the union to delay ratification of the new CBA for a minimum of thirty days in which time the plaintiffs hope to gain greater understanding of the agreement and organize opposition to ratification. However, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits in showing that the APWU has failed to provide an adequate opportunity for the union members to be informed about the CBA and cast a meaningful vote. See Carothers v. Presser, 818 F.2d 926, 934 (D.C.Cir.1987) (finding that the court should be reluctant to take jurisdiction when it would require them to control and direct the entire conduct of union elections).

Moreover, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they will suffer irreparable harm if the Court does not grant their request for a TRO. In Elite Entm’t, Inc. v. Reshammiya, No. 08-cv-0641, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31580, at *4 (D.D.C. Apr. 18, 2008), the court held that “the movant must demonstrate that the harm it will suffer is irreparable, meaning that it cannot be adequately compensated by an award of damages.” Similarly, in Al-Fayed v. C.I.A., 254 F.3d 300, 303 n. 2 (D.C.Cir.2001), the court explained that “the party seeking injunctive relief must demonstrate that irreparable harm will result if the relief is not granted.”

In conclusion, the court finds that the plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits, and that they have not demonstrated irreparable injury. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.

gold_text: For the plaintiff to warrant injunctive relief, it must establish that it will face irreparable injury without immediate court intervention. This Circuit “has set a high standard for irreparable injury.” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C.Cir.2006). The injury “must be both certain and great; it must be actual and not theoretical.” Id. (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C.Cir.1985) (per curiam)). The party moving for injunctive relief must demonstrate that “[t]he injury complained of is of such imminence that there is a ‘clear and present’ need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.” Id. (citations omitted). In addition, “the injury must be beyond remediation.” Id.
