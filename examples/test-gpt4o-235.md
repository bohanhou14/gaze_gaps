However, the Trustee argues that applying federal law to allow NAC's claim would subvert Tennessee’s regulatory framework for foreign corporations. This claim hinges on the implied authority from Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, which ensures that federal courts respect state law in diversity cases to prevent discrimination against state citizens. Nonetheless, Erie does not dictate state law adherence in bankruptcy courts, as established in Vanston Bondholders Protective Committee v. Green, 329 U.S. 156.

Bankruptcy courts operate under federal law's purview to determine and distribute claims equitably, unaffected by local statutes prohibiting foreign corporations from recourse in state courts (198 F.2d 392). This federal authority is reaffirmed in cases like In re V-I-D, Inc., further emphasizing that federal courts are not mere extensions of state courts in bankruptcy matters.

Moreover, in reversing a prior decision in Erie favoring general law application, it was clarified that federal courts must avoid state-federal discrimination (337 U.S. 535). This legal framework underscores that NAC's claim can be allowed despite Tennessee’s restrictive laws. Therefore, the District Court correctly determined that NAC’s interstate transaction overrides Tennessee’s statutory barriers, facilitating the claim's allowability under federal bankruptcy law.

gold_text: The Trustee makes the argument that if the claim would not be enforced in the state court then, under the Erie doctrine, Erie R. R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, it should not be enforced in a federal court sitting in that state. In support of this proposition, the Trustee cites Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., 337 U.S. 535, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524. This argument overlooks the fact that jurisdiction in the instant case is based on federal bankruptcy law and not on diversity of citizenship. Thus a bankruptcy court does not sit “as if it were only another state court,” and Erie does not apply. Vanston Bondholders Protective Committee v. Green, 329 U.S. 156, 162, 67 S.Ct. 237, 240. Similarly, Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., supra, being a diversity case, has no bearing on this case. In re V-I-D, Inc., 198 F.2d 392, 396 (C.A. 7), cert. denied, Kelley, Glover & Vale v. Kramer, 344 U.S. 914, 73 S.Ct. 337, 97 L.Ed. 705.
