The district court's habeas decision conclusively determined Paulo's eligibility to apply for § 212(c) relief. The government did not specify the statutory counterpart question in its objections, nor did it raise this issue on appeal, thereby precluding it from being litigated again. As seen in 993 F.2d 499, the INS could not contest the outcome of a prior proceeding simply because it was dissatisfied with the result. Similarly, the government cannot now argue against Paulo's eligibility under a different legal interpretation.

Moreover, under the principles of claim and issue preclusion as detailed in 532 U.S. 742, subsequent litigation is barred on issues already adjudicated or that could have been raised. The district court’s judgment on Paulo's entitlement to apply for § 212(c) relief binds the BIA, as res judicata aims to prevent repetitive litigation and ensure finality. Revisiting Paulo’s eligibility undermines the preclusive effect of the earlier decision and is contrary to established judicial estoppel doctrines.

Thus, res judicata mandates that the IJ and BIA adhere to the district court's ruling, allowing Paulo to seek § 212(c) relief. Paulo’s petition is GRANTED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings in line with this opinion.

gold_text: The government is correct that the question of whether the statutory counterpart rule made Paulo ineligible for § 212(c) relief was not raised in the district court. The government could have made an argument addressed to this question, but it did not. The fact that a particular argument against Paulo’s eligibility was not made by the government and not addressed by the district court does not mean that the issue of Paulo’s eligibility for § 212(c) relief was not decided. See Medina v. INS, 993 F.2d 499, 503 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993). Issue preclusion is designed to “bar[ ] ‘successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination.’ ” Taylor, 553 U.S. at 892, 128 S.Ct. 2161(quoting New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 748, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001)). If a party could avoid issue preclusion by finding some argument it failed to raise in the previous litigation, the bar on successive litigation would be seriously undermined. See 18 James Wm. Moore et ah, Moore’s Federal Practice § 132.02[2][e] (3d ed.2010) (“If a new legal theory or factual assertion raised in the second action is relevant to the issues that were litigated and adjudicated previously, the prior determination of the issue is conclusive on the issue despite the fact that new evidence or argument relevant to the issue was not in fact expressly pleaded, introduced into evidence, or otherwise urged.”). The issue sought to be relitigated in this case is Paulo’s eligibility for § 212(c) relief, which was decided in the previous proceeding by the district court.
