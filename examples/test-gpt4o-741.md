The determination of the district court's judgment aligns with the principle that a lower court's decision must be affirmed if the result is correct, even if the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason. This principle is well-established in legal precedent, as demonstrated in various reference cases. For instance, in Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U.S. 238, 245-246, the appellate court underscored the necessity of affirming correct decisions regardless of the reasoning provided by lower courts. Furthermore, the Supreme Court reiterated this doctrine in the review of administrative orders in Securities & Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, emphasizing that judicial judgments in lieu of administrative judgments are not permissible. We also find reinforcement of this rule in 311 U.S. 55 and 321 F.2d 123, where the appellate review process validated decisions based on different reasoning than initially provided by lower courts.

Given this legal context, we affirm the district court's conclusion of discrimination against the plaintiffs. Although initially premised on marital status discrimination, the correct analysis reveals the broader issue of discrimination based on sex. This finding stands supported within the judicial framework, upholding the district court's outcome even under a revised theory of liability.
