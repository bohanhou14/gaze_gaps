In the case concerning whether Commerce's decision not to reduce respondents’ export prices by the amount of antidumping deposits paid should be sustained, it is imperative to reference precedent cases. Notably, in the case 68 F.3d 1347, the court upheld the decision to deduct certain expenses where the statute did not explicitly classify them as direct or indirect expenses related to the sales in question. This decision supports the idea that the statute allows for some level of interpretation by Commerce concerning adjustments to sales prices.

Furthermore, referencing case 713 F.2d 1568, it's clear that the calculation of anti-dumping duties involves reconstructing price at different points in the commerce chain depending on the relationship of the importer to the foreign producer. This underscores Commerce's method of ensuring arm’s length transactions whether the importer is related or unrelated.

Applying this understanding, Commerce’s decision not to reduce export prices by the antidumping deposits is consistent with past practices, as the deposits serve as a security measure and not as an additional cost. This interpretation aligns with the reasonable statutory interpretation illustrated in the referenced cases, thereby justifying sustaining Commerce’s decision.

United States, 713 F.2d 1568, 1571-72 (Fed.Cir.1983) (explaining that Commerce must adjust both normal value and export price "in an attempt to reconstruct the price at a specific, 'common' point in the chain of commerce, so that the-value can be fairly compared on an equivalent basis”). For example, the export price is reduced by the cost of delivering the subject merchandise from the exporting country to the United States, 19 U.S.C, § 1677a(c)(2)(A), because this additional cost is not a part of normal value and so distorts the comparison.
