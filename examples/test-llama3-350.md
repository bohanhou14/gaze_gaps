After analyzing the case, it is clear that the court has already made a decision regarding Midwestern's liability. The court has found that Midwestern's air operations fell within the purview of 14 CFR 135 and its requirements for obtaining a certificate demonstrating compliance therein. This decision is supported by the reference case 690 F.2d 191, which states that a corporate officer may not be held civilly liable for a corporate violation of the Rivers and Harbors Act unless either the Act itself authorizes such liability, or there are sufficient allegations and proof to permit negation of the corporate form.

Regarding E.C.C. and Edrei Communications, the court has found that Edrei Communications is not liable for Midwestern's violations because it had no involvement in the operations of the aircraft. This decision is supported by the reference case 526 F.2d 1293, which states that a corporate officer may not be held civilly liable for a corporate violation unless there are sufficient allegations and proof to permit negation of the corporate form.

Regarding E.C.C.'s liability, the court has found that there is a factual question regarding its involvement with Midwestern's flights, and therefore denied both parties' motions for summary judgment as to E.C.C. This decision is supported by the reference case 763 F.2d 133, which states that a lessor who exercises some control over the aircraft may be found liable for a lessee's violations if the facts implicate the lessor in the operation.

In conclusion, the court's decision regarding Midwestern's liability is supported by the reference case 690 F.2d 191, and the decisions regarding E.C.C. and Edrei Communications' liability are supported by the reference cases 526 F.2d 1293 and 763 F.2d 133, respectively.

gold_text: There is a time honored body of law upholding the protections of the corporate form, which has at times served to protect individuals from liability in government actions to prosecute regulatory violations. See Johnson Oil Co., Inc. v. United States Dept. of Energy, 690 F.2d 191, 202 (Temp. Emergency Court of Appeals 1982) (general rule of immunity of stockholders upheld absent explicit statutory provision); United States v. Sexton Cove Estates, 526 F.2d 1293, 1300 (5th Cir.1976) (corporate officer may not be held civilly liable for corporate violation of the Rivers and Harbors Act unless either the Act itself authorizes such liability, or there is sufficient proof to permit negation of the corporate form). But, see United States v. Pollution Abatement Services of Oswego, Inc., 763 F.2d 133, 134-35 (2d Cir.1985) (citing Congressional intent to hold “persons” liable for violations, no reason exists to shield corporate officers from civil liability when directly involved in unlawful activity).
