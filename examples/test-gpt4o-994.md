The issue of qualified immunity is addressed with reference to Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, where the court emphasized that qualified immunity shields government officials from liability for civil damages if their actions did not violate "clearly established" statutory or constitutional rights that a reasonable person would have known. Furthermore, the court in the same case stated that immunity is judged by objective legal reasonableness, and if extraordinary circumstances are proven where the official neither knew nor should have known the legal standard, the defense is sustained.

In the context of the present case, the defendants' imposition of disciplinary actions, including no-contact visitation, falls within the discretionary ambit provided they were not in clear violation of established rights. This contention is supported by the precedent in Procunier v. Navarette, 572 F.2d 1260, where the court held that custodial procedures believed to be proper at the time were protected under qualified immunity, even if subsequent developments rendered such beliefs incorrect. The record lacks evidence indicating malice or bad faith on the part of the Reformatory officials.
 
Given the absence of a clearly established right to contact visitation and the discretionary nature of the policies governing such privileges, the Magistrate correctly held that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. This conclusion aligns with the principles established in both Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, and Procunier v. Navarette, 572 F.2d 1260, reaffirming that officials are protected from liability for actions within their discretionary role unless they clearly contravene established rights.

VI
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the ruling of the Magistrate that the implementation of a no-contact visitation policy for inmates with proven drug use did not constitute a due process violation and that defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.

gold_text: A public official is entitled to qualified or good faith immunity unless the official knew or reasonably should have known that his action would violate the constitutional rights of the plaintiff or if he took the action with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 815, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2736, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). See also Wycoff v. Brewer, 572 F.2d 1260, 1267 (8th Cir.1978); Ervin v. Ciccone, 557 F.2d 1260, 1262 (8th Cir.1977). In determining the reasonableness of an officialâ€™s belief that an action was constitutional, the court should look to whether the action violated a well-settled and unquestioned constitutional right.
