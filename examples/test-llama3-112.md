The court's jurisdiction over the case is not in question, as the plaintiffs have brought a federal question case under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and the INS has not raised a ripeness challenge. In Dorfmann v. Boozer, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 272, 414 F.2d 1168, 1171 n.8 (1969), the court held that relief cannot be granted to a class before an order has been entered determining that class treatment is proper.

The INS claims that the regulation is valid because it is reasonably related to the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act. However, this argument is problematic because it relies on Carlson v. Landon, 342 U.S. 524, 72 S.Ct. 525, 96 L.Ed. 547 (1952), which involved a specific factual context and is not directly applicable to this case. In Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, — U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2803, 2810, 81 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984), the court held that the INA evinces "at best evidence of peripheral concern with employment of illegal entrants."

The district court's grant of a preliminary injunction is also supported by the fact that the plaintiffs have shown that the balance of hardships sharply favors their side. In FERGUSON v. IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE, 452 F.2d 816, the court held that the hardship from being unable to work to support themselves and their dependents, to obtain release bonds, and to pay for legal representation is beyond question.

In conclusion, the district court's order granting a preliminary injunction is affirmed. The court's analysis is consistent with the principles set forth in FERGUSON v. IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE, 452 F.2d 816 and Dorfmann v. Boozer, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 272, 414 F.2d 1168, 1171 n.8 (1969).

gold_text: The INS asserts that in the absence of class certification, the preliminary injunction may properly cover only the named plaintiffs. We agree. See, e.g., Hollon v. Mathis Independent School District, 491 F.2d 92 (5th Cir.1974) (when suit was brought by individual challenging school regulations, a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the regulation against anyone else went further than necessary to serve the purpose of maintaining the parties’ status quo pending trial on the merits); Davis v. Romney, 490 F.2d 1360, 1366 (3d Cir.1974) (“Relief cannot be granted to a class before an order has been entered determining that class treatment is proper”); Tape Head Co. v. RCA, 452 F.2d 816, 819 (10th Cir.1971).
