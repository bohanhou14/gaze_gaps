The Court recognizes the application of collateral estoppel in this context but also notes significant limitations as discussed in relevant case law. According to Reference Case 4 B.R. 814, collateral estoppel generally does not apply if the issues have not been actually litigated, which is particularly relevant in cases resulting in default judgments. The Court in 4 B.R. 814 highlights that not even facts necessary to a default judgment can preclude relitigation in bankruptcy dischargeability determinations.

Similarly, Reference Case 20 B.R. 7 emphasizes that bankruptcy courts are not bound by previous default judgments when assessing the dischargeability of debts under § 523(a). This perspective supports Goux’s case, as it ensures the bankruptcy court’s independent evaluation of willfulness and maliciousness under § 523(a)(6).

In applying these principles, the Court finds that the Debtor’s prior guilty plea does not serve to conclusively establish all elements required for nondischargeability under Code § 523(a)(4). The factual issues surrounding Debtor’s intent and fraudulent appropriation must be specifically adjudicated within this proceeding despite the previous criminal conviction. Accordingly, Gualtieri's reliance on Debtor's guilty plea for summary judgment on the grounds of collateral estoppel is insufficient.

Therefore, the Court denies Gualtieri’s motion for summary judgment, directing that the matter proceed to trial to resolve any genuine issues of material fact.

gold_text: In contrast to these cases is In re Grazi-ano, supra., The debtor pled guilty to second degree larceny under New York state law at his arraignment. When the aggrieved party sought to utilize the doctrine of collateral estoppel in its action under Code § 523(a)(4), the bankruptcy court refused, holding that criteria number “(2)” of the four-part test had not been met. The court consequently allowed debtor to introduce evidence at an evidentiary hearing on issues raised by his prior guilty plea, finding support for this result in a line of cases declining to give collateral estoppel effect to prior default judgments. Id., 35 B.R. at 595 n. 1; See Matter of McMillan, supra, 579 F.2d at 292-93; First National Bank of Gainesville v. Grainger (In re Grainger), 20 B.R. 7, 10 (Bankr.D.S.C.1981); Franks v. Thomason, 4 B.R. 814, 821 (N.D.Ga.1980). The bankruptcy court considered the evidence taken at the evidentia-ry hearing prior to declaring the debt non-dischargeable.
