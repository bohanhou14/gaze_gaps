First, as to the withdrawal of the request for a Fatico hearing, Santiago effectively waived an opportunity to challenge the government's evidence through a full evidentiary hearing. Courts have consistently held that a defendant does not have an absolute right to such a hearing, as underscored in cases like Pugliese, 805 F.2d at 1123. The district court here provided Santiago with adequate opportunities to contest the PSR and the government's assertions, and Santiago’s failure to take advantage of those opportunities does not amount to ineffective assistance. See Reference case 818 F.2d 1052.

Secondly, regarding the counsel’s letter that misfocused on § 924(c) rather than the § 2D1.1 enhancement, we assess this under the lens of reasonableness. The Supreme Court has established that not every investigatory or strategic error by defense counsel constitutes ineffective assistance. Counsel is not compelled to exhaustively pursue every angle, particularly if deemed futile or harmful, as noted in Strickland, 466 U.S. at 699 and reaffirmed in United States v. Cruz, 785 F.2d 399, 406 (2d Cir.1986). Here, while the letter may reflect a strategic misstep, it does not meet the threshold of unreasonableness required to satisfy a Strickland claim. See Reference case 417 F.3d 305.

Therefore, Santiago's ineffective assistance claim fails to demonstrate that the counsel's overall performance was objectively unreasonable or that different actions by counsel would have altered the sentencing outcome in any meaningful way.

gold_text: First, a defendant’s counsel may properly decide to forego a Fatico hearing as a “matter of strategy,” United States v. Lee, 818 F.2d 1052, 1056 (2d Cir.1987), and we presume that such a strategy is sound absent a strong showing to the contrary, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Here, as the district court noted at sentencing, it was indeed “wise[]” for Santiago to avoid a Fatico hearing at which his prior violent conduct would have been reviewed in detail for the benefit of the district court. Sentencing Tr. at 12. See generally Greiner v. Wells, 417 F.3d 305, 319 (2d Cir.2005) (“We will not normally fault counsel for foregoing a potentially fruitful course of conduct if that choice also entails a significant potential downside.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, Santiago gives no indication that a Fatico hearing would have resulted in favorable factual findings. He asserts only that his counsel had “nothing to lose by holding the government to its burden of proof.” Appellant’s Br. at 32. The Supreme Court, however, has recently rejected the application of a “nothing to lose” standard in this context. Knowles v. Mirzayance, — U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1419, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009).
