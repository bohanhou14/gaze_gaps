In the context of a police officer's use of force during an arrest, the threshold for determining whether the force used was excessive is a high one. The United States Supreme Court has set forth a standard for determining excessive force in Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). The Court held that the objective reasonableness of the force used is the determining factor, and that the reasonableness of the force used must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene.

In the case at hand, Gainor alleges that Officer Rogers used excessive force during his arrest. The district court denied Officer Rogers' motion for summary judgment on the issue of excessive force, and Gainor's claim was sent to trial. On appeal, Officer Rogers argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for summary judgment, and that he was entitled to qualified immunity.

To determine whether Officer Rogers was entitled to qualified immunity, the court must first determine whether his actions violated clearly established law. In Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985), the Supreme Court held that an officer is entitled to qualified immunity unless the law was clearly established at the time of the violation. In this case, the law was clearly established at the time of the violation, and Officer Rogers' actions violated that law.

Therefore, the court must determine whether Officer Rogers' actions were objectively reasonable. In Graham v. Connor, the Supreme Court held that the objective reasonableness of the force used is the determining factor. In this case, there is a factual dispute as to whether Officer Rogers used excessive force, and the court must resolve that dispute in order to determine whether his actions were objectively reasonable.

In conclusion, the court must determine whether Officer Rogers was entitled to qualified immunity for his actions during Gainor's arrest. To do so, the court must first determine whether his actions violated clearly established law, and then determine whether his actions were objectively reasonable. In this case, the law was clearly established at the time of the violation, and there is a factual dispute as to whether Officer Rogers used excessive force. Therefore, the court must resolve that dispute in order to determine whether Officer Rogers' actions were objectively reasonable, and whether he is entitled to qualified immunity.

gold_text: With respect to Gainor’s final claim, the district court found that Gainor’s First Amendment rights were clearly implicated by the facts of this case. We agree. The First Amendment protects the right to convey religious messages in public forums. See Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness, 452 U.S. 640, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981). Not only did the act of carrying a large wooden cross by itself suggest Gainor’s intent to express a religious message, it is undisputed that Gainor explained his religious mission to Rogers. The First Amendment also protects Gainor’s right to verbally challenge the police officers’ actions. See City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 461, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2509, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987) (“The First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers.”); Norwell v. City of Cincinnati, 414 U.S. 14, 94 S.Ct. 187, 38 L.Ed.2d 170 (1973). To the extent Gainor claims he was arrested solely for spreading a religious message in a manner the officers found “bizarre,” or for challenging the officers’ right to demand production of identification, there remains on the merits of this claim genuine issues of material fact.
