In the case of McQueen v. Swenson, the court held that a defendant must bear the initial burden of demonstrating that counsel failed to perform some essential duty. However, once this failure has been established, the burden of demonstrating unfairness shifts to the petitioner. (498 F.2d 207)

In the present case, the district court found that the ineffective assistance of counsel did not prejudice the defendant's right to a fair trial. However, we disagree with this finding and hold that the omission of admissible evidence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (539 F.2d 663)

The evidence that was omitted included a shoehorn that was substantially identical to the description given by the defendant, which could have been used as a weapon. Additionally, the police report revealed that Donald Cole, a frequent visitor to the deceased's apartment, left the apartment the morning of the murder and could have provided information about the shoehorn. (498 F.2d 207)

Furthermore, the police report indicated that Conrad Zoeller, a dentist who was acquainted with the deceased, had stolen a car and some of his shirts were missing. This could have been used to corroborate the defendant's alibi. (498 F.2d 207)

The court also noted that the coroner's report revealed that the deceased had three bullet wounds, which could have been used to support the defendant's claim of self-defense. (498 F.2d 207)

In conclusion, we hold that the ineffective assistance of counsel in this case was prejudicial and that the defendant's conviction should be reversed and remanded for a new trial. (535 F.2d 407)

gold_text: . We note that since our holding in McQueen I, 498 F.2d 207, the Ninth Circuit has joined the Sixth Circuit in holding that once ineffective assistance of counsel has been established harmless error tests do not apply. Cooper v. Fitzharris, 551 F.2d 1162, 1164-65 (9th Cir. 1977); Beasley v. United States, 491 F.2d 687, 696 (6th Cir. 1974). We have continued to require a showing of prejudice where counselâ€™s failure to perform an essential duty has been established. United States v. Easter, 539 F.2d 663, 666 (8th Cir. 1976); Thomas v. Wyrick, 535 F.2d 407, 414 (8th Cir. 1976).
