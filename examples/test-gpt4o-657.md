8. The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies to this case given that the grounding occurred under circumstances which ordinarily would not occur if proper care had been exercised by the tug. This is supported by reference case 164 F.2d 224, which places the burden on the tug to prove that proper care was exercised. The evidence clearly shows that such care was not exercised, as the mate was negligent in navigating too close to the beacon or marker, causing the grounding and resulting delay.

9. Furthermore, the Court recognizes, as established in reference case 152 F.2d 916, that the findings of fact should be clear and concise. The District Judge, in this instance, has provided a detailed account of the facts and basis for each conclusion, ensuring compliance with judicial standards.

10. The respondent's actions in preventing further performance after the grounding, as confirmed by 170 F.2d 899, constitutes a breach of the towage contract. The libelant is, therefore, entitled to damages as the delay and subsequent instructions from the respondent effectively terminated the contract without just cause.

In conclusion, the negligence of the tug “Meteor” in handling the barge “B. H. 3” caused the grounding and delay, for which the respondent is partially entitled to damages. However, the respondent’s breach by preventing further performance leads to the libelant’s entitlement to the specified damages.

gold_text: In a case such as this, where the towed vessel is unmanned, the tower is clearly and solely responsible for the safe navigation of the tug and tow. The tower is always charged with responsibility for knowledge of the conditions of navigation in the waters where the tug operates, including knowledge of channels, depth of water, obstructions, shoals and other dangers known generally to men experienced in navigation. The Severance, 4 Cir., 152 F.2d 916, certiorari denied [Stone v. Diamond Steamship Transportation Corp.], 328 U.S. 853, 66 S.Ct. 1344, 90 L.Ed. 1626. Although an injury to the tow raises no presumption of fault on the part of the tug, 86 C.J.S., Towage, § 34, the cases hold that evidence of grounding of a barge or other vessel in tow of a tug establishes a prima facie case of negligence on the part of the tug. The Reichert Line, 2 Cir., 64 F.2d 13; The Anaconda, 4 Cir., 164 F.2d 224; The Evelyn v. Gregory, 4 Cir., 170 F.2d 899.
