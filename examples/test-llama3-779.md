The case before us raises the question of whether Terry Roberts was terminated in retaliation for opposing an allegedly discriminatory employment practice and whether the company regarded him as having a disability. The lower court dismissed Roberts' claim, but we find that there are material factual disputes that preclude summary judgment.

Firstly, Roberts' status as a labor lawyer and his opposition to the assessment were protected activities under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The company's requirement that he take the assessment was an impermissible medical test under the ADA, and Roberts' request for accommodation was reasonable.

Secondly, the company's actions were causally related to Roberts' protected activities. The company was aware of Roberts' opposition to the assessment and his request for accommodation, and it terminated him shortly after. This close temporal relationship between the protected activity and the adverse action is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.

Thirdly, the company's mixed motive defense is not sufficient to carry its burden on summary judgment. While the company argues that it would have terminated Roberts for legitimate reasons even in the absence of any discriminatory consideration, the evidence suggests that this is pretextual. The company's termination letter refers to Roberts' "poor judgment" and "lack of trust" in his ability to represent the company in confidential employee relations matters, but it does not mention any specific instances of improper disclosure. Furthermore, the company's own statements during Roberts' unemployment benefits proceeding emphasize Roberts' resistance to the assessment and his decision to hire an attorney, rather than disclosure of confidential information regarding other cases.

In conclusion, we find that there are material factual disputes that preclude summary judgment on Roberts' claim. The case must be remanded for further proceedings. The reference cases that support this conclusion include 868 F.2d 397, 616 F.2d 221, 615 F.2d 1025, 144 F.3d 364, and 793 F.2d 714.

gold_text: As an alternative basis for affirming the judgment of the district court with respect to this accommodation retaliation claim, Rayonier argues that the manner in which Roberts exercised his right to oppose taking the medical test was unreasonable and therefore not statutorily protected activity. In this regard, Rayonier argues that Roberts never clearly communicated to Rayonier that his request was in the'nature of an ADA accommodation, nor did he clearly apprise Rayonier of his opinion that the test as applied to him would violate the ADA. Most particularly, Rayonier argues that Roberts’ selection of Thomas as his attorney was unreasonable in light of the fact that Thomas and/or others in his office were plaintiffs’ lawyers who had recently brought employment discrimination cases against Rayonier, and actually had one matter still pending. Rayonier supports its argument by pointing to numerous eases in which courts have found that unreasonable exercise of actions that would otherwise be protected under Title VII is unprotected. See Rollins v. State of Fla. Dept. of Law Enforcement, 868 F.2d 397 (11th Cir.1989); Rosser v. Laborers’ Intern. Union of N.America, 616 F.2d 221 (5th Cir.1980) (holding that although opposition to unlawful employment practices is protected, such protection is not absolute); Jefferies v. Harris County Community Assoc., 615 F.2d 1025 (5th Cir.1980) (ac cord, and applying a balancing test); see also Douglas v. DynMcDermott Petroleum Operations Co., 144 F.3d 364 (5th Cir.1998) (involving in-house counsel); Jones v. Flagship Int'l, 793 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1986) (involving in-house counsel). Rayonier suggests that as an in-house attorney having duties of loyalty and confidentiality to Rayonier, Roberts was unreasonable in hiring Thomas, an attorney who had recently sued the company and who was likely to use in other cases against the company any confidential information which Roberts might appropriately reveal to him. At this stage of the case, we decline to address the issue because the district court has not addressed the issue; because developments in the case may make it unnecessary to address the issue; and because, if the issue is to be addressed, the district court may determine that the inquiry would be facilitated by additional development of the relevant facts.
