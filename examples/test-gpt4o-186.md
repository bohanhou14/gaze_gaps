Chen also challenges the IJ’s conclusion that he lacks a well-founded fear of future persecution. Chen’s argument centers on the claim that his girlfriend was forced to abort her pregnancy and that he himself would face severe repercussions for defying China’s birth-control policies. However, threats alone do not establish past persecution unless they are extreme, of an immediate or menacing nature, and carried out. See Boykov v. INS, 109 F.3d 413, 416 (7th Cir.1997); Ahmed v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 611, 616 (7th Cir.2003).

Moreover, Chen failed to provide specific and detailed facts to support the subjective genuineness and objective reasonableness of his fear of future persecution. See 350 F.3d 685, 1030. Without demonstrating past persecution, Chen is not entitled to a presumption of future persecution. Additionally, the BIA determined that he did not present concrete evidence proving that he is more vulnerable to persecution than any member of the general public. Ahmed v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d at 611.

Furthermore, the IJ and BIA found that Chen’s fear was unfounded due to changed conditions in China. The reported threats and subsequent forced abortion do not constitute sufficient evidence of future persecution as Chen has not demonstrated that these threats were indicative of continuing danger. See Boykov, 109 F.3d at 416. Since the evidence does not support Chen's claims, his petition for asylum must be denied.

For the foregoing reasons, we deny Xiong Chen’s petition for review.

gold_text: Chen next contends that the BIA failed to recognize that he was persecuted when the school fired him for resisting China’s coercive population control policies — namely by having a child without registering his marriage and then hiding from authorities. It is true that severe state-sanctioned economic deprivation can constitute persecution, Medhin v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 685, 689 (7th Cir.2003), but Chen alleged only that he was fired from his job, and we have held that being fired from a job, even if it is discriminatory, does not constitute persecution. Id.; Musabelliu, 442 F.3d at 994. Although Chen also claims that he was persecuted when family-planning authorities threatened him with “heightened penalties,” we have repeatedly held that vague, unfulfilled threats like this one generally do not compel a finding of past persecution. Bejko v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 482, 486 (7th Cir.2006); Ahmed v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 611, 616 (7th Cir.2003).
