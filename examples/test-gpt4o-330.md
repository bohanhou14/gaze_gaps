**Generation:**

As previously discussed, the Defendant's decision to pay Plaintiff $37,000.00 was not de novo wrong. Even under the assumption that the decision was wrong, the Court must next determine if reasonable grounds support the administrator's interpretation, thereby invoking an arbitrary and capricious review standard. According to *HCA Health Servs. of Ga., Inc. v. Employers Health Ins. Co.*, 240 F.3d 982 (11th Cir.2001), if the claims administrator’s interpretation is considered reasonable, then it is entitled to deference unless an actual conflict of interest is present.

The Defendant’s rationale aligns with precedent cases emphasizing structured guidelines within policy terms, as noted in *HCA*, 240 F.3d at 993, where the court underscored the importance of adhering to predefined standards. Additionally, in *Blue Cross v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.*, 10 F.3d 1547 (11th Cir.1993), the Defendants argued that their organization removed any profit motive, thus reinforcing the integrity of their decision-making system. This lack of a profit motive underscores a degree of neutrality and reasonableness in the interpretation, further bolstering the rationale as not arbitrary and capricious.

Consequently, given that no arbitrary or capricious elements exist and the decision was reasonably grounded, reaffirmation of the benefit decision is compelled. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of the Defendant is appropriate, and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is denied.

gold_text: Had the Court found that Defendant’s decision was wrong, the next step would have been to determine if Plaintiffs interpretation of the Policy was correct or at least reasonable. See HCA Health Services of Ga., Inc. v. Employers Health Ins. Co., 240 F.3d 982, 994 (11th Cir.2001) (“If the court determines that the claims administrator’s interpretation is ‘wrong,’ the court then proceeds to decide whether the claimant has proposed a ‘reasonable’ interpretation of the plan.”) (quoting Lee v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, 10 F.3d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1994)). Plaintiff argues that Guaranteed Issue Amount is an ambiguous term open to multiple interpretations. Because “contra proferentem applies to ERISA plans,” after finding Defendant’s decision wrong or the phrase Guaranteed Issue Amount ambiguous, the Court would be required to construe “the ambiguities ... against the drafter of a document;” and, “as such, [Plaintiffs] interpretation [would be] viewed as correct.” HCA 240 F.3d at 994 n. 24. Even though the Court would have to accept Plaintiffs definition of Guaranteed Issue Amount as correct, Plaintiff would “not necessarily prevail.” Id. Plaintiff would only succeed if the Court were to determine that Defendant’s wrong interpretation was also unreasonable. Id. Because the Court agrees with Defendant’s interpretation of Guaranteed Issue Amount, the Court cannot find Defendant’s interpretation unreasonable. Consequently, a second and separate reason for affirming Defendant’s decision is that even if both Defendant and the Court are wrong, the decision is reasonable because Guaranteed Issue Amount is a term commonly associated with underwriting, and not with payable benefits. See 11/15/04 NATUNDLH 18 (stating that guaranteed issue policy is one without medical underwriting, also known as simplified issue).
