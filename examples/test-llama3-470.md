In this case, the Search Warrant executed on SDI Future Health, Inc. was deemed an impermissible General Warrant due to its lack of particularity. The warrant failed to describe with required particularity the things to be seized, making it an overbroad and general warrant. This is similar to the warrants disapproved in cases such as Alioto v. United States, 216 F.Supp. 48 (E.D.Wis.1963), and United States v. Cardwell, 680 F.2d 75 (9th Cir.1982).

The Magistrate Judge correctly ruled that the Search Warrant failed to meet the particularity requirement, citing United States v. The Offices Known as 50 State Distributing Co., 708 F.2d 1371 (9th Cir.1983). Furthermore, the Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge that the Search Warrant did not incorporate Special Agent Bomdstad's Affidavit, which was not attached to the warrant or physically present at the time of the search.

The Government's argument that the "good faith" exception should apply is also rejected. The Court finds that the agents conducting the search did not objectively believe that the warrant was valid, as held in United States v. Row, 58 F.3d 423 (9th Cir.1995), and Center Art Galleries-Hawaii, Inc. v. United States, 875 F.2d 747 (9th Cir.1989).

In conclusion, the Search Warrant executed on SDI Future Health, Inc. was an impermissible General Warrant due to its lack of particularity. The Court concurs with the Magistrate Judge's findings and recommends the suppression of all evidence derived from the illegal seizure of documents from SDI's premises and offsite storage facility.

gold_text: While the Court concurs in and adopts the factual findings made by the Magistrate Judge, the Court concludes that the particular facts of this case are more closely akin to those present in United States v. Cardwell, 680 F.2d 75 (9th Cir.1982), United States v. Spilotro, 800 F.2d 959 (9th Cir.1986), and United States v. Kow, 58 F.3d 423 (9th Cir.1995). The particularity deficiencies in the Search Warrant, the failures of the supervising search agent, and the wholesale seizure of the vast majority of SDIâ€™s documents, and computer files, including many having no relevance to the persons, entities or subject matter under investigation, lead to the conclusion that the actions of the searching agents constituted an impermissible gener al search which warrants suppression of all evidence seized.
