In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, it is crucial to consider the standards of proof applied by the federal courts and state courts. The Supreme Court has declined to decide whether federal or state standards should be applied in diversity cases, as seen in cases such as Mercer v. Theriot, 377 U.S. 152, 84 S.Ct. 1157, 12 L.Ed.2d 206 (1964), and Dick v. New York Life Ins. Co., 359 U.S. 437, 79 S.Ct. 921, 3 L.Ed.2d 935 (1959). However, the majority of circuits have held that the federal standard should be applied, as stated in Reuter v. Eastern Air Lines, 226 F.2d 443, 445 (5 Cir. 1955).

In this case, the evidence presented was insufficient to support the jury's verdict. The only significant evidence of negligence was Mrs. San Antonio's testimony about the car's speed, which was impaired by her contradictory statement and the Department of Motor Vehicles report. Furthermore, the court found that the improper summation by plaintiffs' counsel was fundamental error, as seen in New York Central R.R. v. Johnson, 279 U.S. 310, 318-319, 49 S.Ct. 300, 73 L.Ed. 706 (1929).

In conclusion, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial, citing F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Wilson, 74 F.2d 439, 442-443 (5 Cir. 1934). The court's decision emphasizes the importance of considering the standards of proof in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, as seen in cases such as Mercer v. Theriot, 377 U.S. 152, 84 S.Ct. 1157, 12 L.Ed.2d 206 (1964), and Dick v. New York Life Ins. Co., 359 U.S. 437, 79 S.Ct. 921, 3 L.Ed.2d 935 (1959).
