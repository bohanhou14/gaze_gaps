**Generation:**



The cases before us stem from a program of above-ground atomic weapons tests conducted during the 1950's at Camp Desert Rock, Nevada. The servicemen, Donald Sheehan and Ellis Gaspard, took part in these tests and have developed serious personal disabilities that they allege are a result of hazardous radiation exposure from these tests. They filed claims for benefits through the Veterans Administration (VA) and later filed FTCA claims in Federal District Court.

The Feres doctrine bars FTCA claims for in-service injuries, and we find that the allegations of the servicemen fall within this doctrine. The doctrine also bars FTCA claims for the wives of the servicemen, even though they bring independent claims of emotional distress and loss of consortium.

The servicemen also bring Bivens claims, alleging intentional interference with their constitutional rights. We find that the rationale behind the Feres doctrine also bars the Bivens claims, as the need for plenary discretion in military affairs and the existence of an adequate, congressionally-imposed compensation scheme instruct us to avoid imposing or inquiring into monetary damages when a service person is injured. The compensation scheme of the Veterans Benefits Act is meant to be exclusive, and we must respect the congressional intent to provide a comprehensive remedy for service-connected disabilities.

In conclusion, we affirm the dismissals of the FTCA and Bivens claims, as they are barred by the Feres doctrine and the compensation scheme of the Veterans Benefits Act. The servicemen's claims are not barred by the statute of limitations, as they were filed within one year of discovery of their injuries.

gold_text: . The Wallace court did acknowledge that Bivens would still support a petition for injunctive relief by a serviceman. See, e.g., Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973). Of course, injunctive relief, a matter of discretion in the district court, could not be used to obstruct necessary military orders. Other non-monetary relief may also be available in the civilian courts, even in some cases where the military justice system retains jurisdiction. Eg., Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953) (court-martial subject to habeas corpus review). See Sherman, Legal Inadequacies and Doctrinal Restraints in Controlling the Military, 49 Ind.L.J. 539, 575-80 (1974). The instant case, however, concerns only a request for money damages.
