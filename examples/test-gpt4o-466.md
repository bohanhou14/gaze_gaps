We further conclude that the district court's assessment of the lack of prejudice is incongruent with the precedents governing ineffective assistance of counsel claims. As we highlighted in McQueen I, the failure to perform a reasonable pretrial investigation is a critical element of the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment (498 F.2d 207). The requirement that defense counsel must perform at least as well as a lawyer with ordinary training and skill in criminal law is underscored in cases such as Johns v. Perini, 491 F.2d 687, setting a standard for reasonably effective assistance.

Moreover, the court's conclusion of non-prejudicial impact fails to align with the principles established in Chapman v. California, that infringements on constitutional rights, such as the right to effective assistance of counsel, cannot be deemed harmless (551 F.2d 1162). In line with these precedents, this court must ensure that any errors capable of affecting the trial's outcome are scrutinized rigorously.

Additionally, the district court's reliance on anecdotal procedures and speculative strategies does not satisfy the obligations delineated in our jurisprudence, which mandate active and thorough representation (539 F.2d 663). Thus, considering the substantial deprivation of a fair trial process, as indicated in Thomas v. Wyrick (535 F.2d 407), the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus is warranted to rectify these shortcomings.

Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

gold_text: . We note that since our holding in McQueen I, 498 F.2d 207, the Ninth Circuit has joined the Sixth Circuit in holding that once ineffective assistance of counsel has been established harmless error tests do not apply. Cooper v. Fitzharris, 551 F.2d 1162, 1164-65 (9th Cir. 1977); Beasley v. United States, 491 F.2d 687, 696 (6th Cir. 1974). We have continued to require a showing of prejudice where counselâ€™s failure to perform an essential duty has been established. United States v. Easter, 539 F.2d 663, 666 (8th Cir. 1976); Thomas v. Wyrick, 535 F.2d 407, 414 (8th Cir. 1976).
