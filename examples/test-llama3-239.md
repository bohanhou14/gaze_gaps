gold_text: We recognize that the Supreme Court has not, except by dicta, passed upon whether or not the need to prevent destruction of evidence is, under circumstances like these, an “exigent circumstance” which renders a warrantless entry constitutionally reasonable. See Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967). Cf. Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948); Vale v. Louisiana, 399 U.S. 30, 90 S.Ct. 1969, 26 L.Ed.2d 409 (1970). We believe, however, that other circuits which have recognized this type of exception are correct. United States v. Rubin, 474 F.2d 262 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 833, 94 S.Ct. 173, 38 L.Ed.2d 68 (1973); United States v. Blake, 484 F.2d 50 (8th Cir. 1973); cert. denied, 417 U.S. 949, 94 S.Ct. 3076, 41 L.Ed.2d 669 (1974); Thomas v. Parett, 524 F.2d 779 (8th Cir. 1975); United States v. McLaughlin, 525 F.2d 517 (9th Cir. 1975). Cf. United States v. Rosselli, 506 F.2d 627 (7th Cir. 1974).
