The case of Montana v. United States (450 U.S. 544) established that a tribe cannot regulate reservation land owned in fee by non-members of the tribe unless there is an express delegation of power from Congress or the regulation meets the criteria for one of the enunciated exceptions. The Supreme Court in Montana held that tribes retain inherent power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over non-members on their reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands, but only under certain circumstances.

In this case, the Cooperatives, Reservation Telephone Cooperative and West River Telecommunications Cooperative, argue that the Three Affiliated Tribes lack the power to tax their rights-of-way on non-Indian fee land. The Cooperative's rights-of-way are the equivalent of non-Indian fee land, as recognized under Strate v. A-1 Contractors (520 U.S. 438). Therefore, the Tribe's possessory interest tax must be subjected to a Montana analysis.

The Cooperatives have not entered into a consensual relationship with the Three Affiliated Tribes, as required by the Montana exception. The Cooperative's activities on the Reservation are not regulated by the Tribe, and they do not benefit from any tribal services or benefits. Therefore, the Tribe's possessory interest tax on the Cooperative's rights-of-way is not justified under the Montana exception.

In conclusion, the Three Affiliated Tribes lack the power to tax the Cooperative's rights-of-way on non-Indian fee land. The Cooperatives have not entered into a consensual relationship with the Tribe, and the Tribe's possessory interest tax is not justified under the Montana exception. The Court GRANTS the Cooperatives' Motion for Summary Judgment and DISMISSES the Tribe's possessory interest tax as unconstitutional.

gold_text: The first Montana exception applies when “a tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribes or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements.” Montana v. U.S., 450 U.S. 544, 565, 101 S.Ct. 1245; see Atkinson Trading Co., Inc. v. Shirley, 532 U.S. 645, 656, 121 S.Ct. 1825, 149 L.Ed.2d 889 (2001) (“Montana’s consensual relationship exception requires that the tax or regulation imposed by the Indian tribe have a nexus to the consensual relationship itself’). The Court concludes, as a matter of law, that the Cooperatives have not entered into a “consensual relationship” with the tribe or its members as a result of providing telecommunication services on the Reservation, or as a result of the sale and service of telephone equipment.
