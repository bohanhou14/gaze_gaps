The court finds that the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) preempts a portion of the California Act, specifically the provisions that allow railroad employees to use accumulated paid sick leave on days when they cannot work because of their own sickness or injury. This conclusion is based on the express preemption clause of RUIA, which states that no employee shall have or assert any right to sickness benefits under a sickness law of any State based upon employment.

In interpreting the scope of RUIA's preemption, the court looks to the statute's purpose and legislative history. The purpose of RUIA was to create a national unemployment insurance program for railroad workers, including those who are unable to work due to sickness or injury. The legislative history reveals that Congress intended to preempt state laws that provide similar benefits to railroad employees.

The court also considers the definitions of "sickness benefits" and "benefits" as used in RUIA. According to RUIA, a "sickness benefit" is a wage-replacement payment for a covered employee who is unable to work due to sickness or injury. The court finds that the California Act provisions that allow railroad employees to use accumulated paid sick leave on days when they cannot work because of their own sickness or injury meet this definition.

The court holds that RUIA preempts these provisions of the California Act, while leaving intact the provisions that allow railroad employees to use their paid sick leave for other purposes, such as caring for family members or seeking protection from domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking.
