Section 549(c) has been construed by various courts as a narrow exception that does not extend to acts violating the automatic stay. In re Schwartz, 954 F.2d 569 (9th Cir. 1992), explains that § 549(c) protects good faith purchasers only in the context of unauthorized debtor transfers, not those barred by an automatic stay. Furthermore, in In re Hill, 156 B.R. 998, 1007-08 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 1993), the court underscored that § 549(c) creates exceptions only in scenarios where the sale does not directly conflict with the automatic stay provisions of § 362.

In this case, London argues for protection under § 549(c), but as established by In re Taylor, 884 F.2d 478 (9th Cir. 1989), actions that violate the automatic stay are generally void unless the debtor is engaging in unreasonable withholding of notice, which the Court has not found here. Moreover, the court in In re Schwartz, 954 F.2d at 573-74, delineated that § 549 deals primarily with unauthorized transactions initiated by debtors, which is distinct from creditor actions blocked by an automatic stay. 

Consequently, § 549(e)’s exception does not apply to Smith’s situation. The argument that the foreclosure sale should not be voided is unsupported by the reference cases, and, as per Easley v. Petti-bone Michigan Corp., 990 F.2d 905, 911 (6th Cir.1993), actions taken in violation of the automatic stay remain void.

gold_text: A number of cases have held that § 549(c) does provide an exception to § 362(a). See In re Taylor, 884 F.2d 478 (9th Cir.1989); In re Carpio, 213 B.R. 744 (Bankr.W.D.Mo. 1997); In re D’Alfonso, 211 B.R. 508 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.1997); In re Hill, 156 B.R. 998 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1993). However, these cases are inconsistent with the plain language of the §§ 362(a) and 549. Further, this line of cases is inconsistent with the Sixth Circuit’s holding in Easley.
