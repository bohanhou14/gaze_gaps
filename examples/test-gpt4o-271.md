Given the Secretary's statutory obligation under 42 U.S.C. §§ 401(j) and 1383(h) to reimburse claimants for travel expenses, it is clear that regulations must be promulgated to ensure these provisions are meaningfully executed. Similar to the necessity articulated in American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90 (1946) for clear rulemaking to avoid ambiguity, the Secretary must delineate rules for travel expense payments. 

Furthermore, the argument that appropriations measures negate the statutory duty is untenable. As established in United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 221 (1980), the presumption against implied repeals compels us to view the Social Security Act and the continuing resolutions as coexisting statutes. This principle requires the Secretary to move forward with rulemaking for travel beyond seventy-five miles, as there's no explicit repeal.

Additionally, the assertion that the Secretary has unfettered discretion on the timing of such rulemaking is flawed. Prolonged delays, as seen with the Secretary’s four-year inaction, undermine statutory purposes and represent an abuse of discretion. In Rios v. Butz, 427 F.Supp. 534, 537 (N.D.Cal.1976), similar dilatory behavior by an agency was deemed an abuse of discretion. Therefore, the Secretary’s delay cannot be justified and mandates immediate corrective action.

Thus, reinforcing the District Court's mandate, it is imperative that the Secretary engages in prompt rulemaking to fulfill her legal duties under the Social Security Act, ensuring adequate regulation of travel expenses for eligible claimants.

gold_text: The Secretary points out that, as recently as April 19, 1984, she has announced her formal intention to publish proposed regulations. See 49 Fed.Reg. 15,850-15,851 (April 19, 1984). As the district court notes, however, a notice of proposal to issue travel expense regulations “is of little significance.” Pulido, 568 F.Supp. at 632. The notice does not bind the Secretary to publish regulations, nor does it prevent her from later denying that she has a mandate to publish regulations. See American Trucking Assoc, v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co., 387 U.S. 397, 415-16, 87 S.Ct. 1608, 1618-19, 18 L.Ed.2d 847 (1967). Indeed, the Secretary has announced such intentions several times before, but has yet to publish proposed regulations. Given this history of delay, we find it necessary to have a timetable established to ensure that the regulations mandated by the statute are, indeed, promulgated. Such timetables are “an appropriate procedure for exercise of the court’s equity powers to vindicate the public interest.” Natural Resources Defense Council v. Train, 510 F.2d 692, 705 (D.C.Cir.1975).
