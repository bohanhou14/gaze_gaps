To qualify for protection under the CAT, De Castro-Gutierrez must establish that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to Colombia. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2). The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a). However, the IJ’s adverse credibility determination can negate the claim if reasonable. See Redd v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 838, 842 (8th Cir.2008). In De Castro-Gutierrez’s case, the IJ and BIA concluded she did not meet this burden. The specifics of her testimony regarding threats and feared persecution did not demonstrate that she would face torture by or with the acquiescence of the Colombian government. See 427 F.3d 1077; Ngure v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 975, 992 (8th Cir.2004).

Additionally, substantial evidence supports that Colombia has taken significant steps to combat FARC violence, which weakens her CAT claim. See Onsongo v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 849, 853 (8th Cir.2006). The IJ’s decision that she could relocate within Colombia to avoid threats further undermines her claim. See 556 F.3d 658. Consequently, De Castro-Gutierrez has not demonstrated that it is more likely than not she would be tortured upon her return, and thus, does not qualify for CAT protection. 

For these reasons, we deny her petition for relief under the CAT.

gold_text: To be entitled to protection under the CAT, an alien must establish that it is “more likely than not that ... she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2). “Torture is defined narrowly as an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment intentionally inflicted by or with the acquiescence of a person acting in an official capacity.” Sheikh v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 1077, 1082 (8th Cir.2005). De Castro-Gutierrez’s CAT claim is based on the same evidence as her withholding of removal claim. We therefore conclude that De Castro-Gutierrez has failed to establish that she is entitled to relief under the CAT. See Clemente-Giron v. Holder, 556 F.3d 658, 662 (8th Cir.2009) (“If the applicant’s CAT claim relies on the same evidence as her ... withholding of removal claim[], the court’s adverse deci sion on ... withholding of .removal will also be determinative of the CAT claim.”).
