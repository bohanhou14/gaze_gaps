In assessing whether the district court abused its discretion in awarding Watson attorney’s fees for time spent on unsuccessful claims, it is essential to apply the principles established in Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, and subsequent interpretations such as in Shapiro v. Ryker, 239 F.3d 1140.

The two-step analysis from Hensley necessitates that we first determine if the unsuccessful claims are unrelated to the successful ones. Claims are “unrelated” if they are “entirely distinct and separate” (239 F.3d at 1499). In this case, all of Watson’s claims shared a common core of facts centered on his coerced report and denial of counsel, and were based on related legal theories. Thus, they are not “entirely distinct and separate.”

The second step requires evaluating whether the plaintiff achieved a level of success that justifies the hours expended. As per Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435, the focus should be on the significance of the overall relief obtained. Watson obtained substantial relief through the preliminary injunction, which achieved significant legal and practical outcomes by preventing the use of his report. This relief altered the legal relationship between the parties, directly fulfilling one of the litigation’s main goals.

Given that Watson’s claims were interrelated and he attained significant relief, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees for the entire litigation. This aligns with the principles established in Hensley and supported by the Ninth Circuit’s analysis in Odima, 239 F.3d at 1499, emphasizing that in cases with related claims, the overall success justifies the award of comprehensive attorney’s fees.

gold_text: In Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), the U.S. Supreme Court proscribed a two-step process for calculating attorney’s fees in a case of partial or limited success. A court must consider (1) whether “the plaintiff fail[ed] to prevail on claims that were unrelated to the claims on which he succeeded,” and (2) whether “the plaintiff aehiev[ed] a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award.” Id. at 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933. Deductions based on limited success are within the discretion of the district court. See Sorenson v. Mink, 239 F.3d 1140, 1147(9th Cir.2001).
