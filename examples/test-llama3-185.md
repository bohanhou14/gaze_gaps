The court's denial of defendants' motions for recusal is based on the lack of evidence demonstrating personal bias or prejudice. The court finds that the defendants' allegations of ex parte contact between the court and the prosecution are unfounded, and that the court's previous rulings were based on the evidence presented in the case. The defendants' motions for reconsideration are also denied, as the court finds that the requirements of Rule 11 were satisfied, and that the defendants were adequately informed of the maximum sentence they faced.

In determining whether to grant bail pending appeal, the court must consider whether the defendant is likely to flee or pose a danger to the community if released. The court must also determine whether the appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact, and whether a favorable ruling for the defendant on appeal would result in reversal or an order for a new trial. In this case, the court finds that the appeal raises a substantial question of law, and that a favorable ruling for the defendant on appeal could result in reversal. However, the court also finds that the defendant is likely to flee or pose a danger to the community if released. Therefore, the court denies defendant Burger's motion for bail pending appeal.

In United States v. Morrison, 938 F.2d 168, the court held that a defendant who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the community if released. Similarly, in United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, the court held that a defendant who is appealing a conviction and sentence must demonstrate that the appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact, and that a favorable ruling for the defendant on appeal would result in reversal or an order for a new trial.

Therefore, the court denies defendants' motions for recusal, reconsideration, and bail pending appeal. The court finds that the defendants' allegations of ex parte contact are unfounded, and that the court's previous rulings were based on the evidence presented in the case. The court also finds that the defendant is likely to flee or pose a danger to the community if released, and that the appeal does not raise a substantial question of law or fact.

gold_text: Upon consideration of the arguments and authorities cited by the parties, the court finds that defendant Burger’s motion for bail pending appeal must be denied. Initially, the court notes that defendant Burger has not sought to establish the first two requirements that he is not likely to flee and that the appeal is not filed for purposes of delay. Thus, the court finds that defendant Burger’s motion should be denied on that basis alone. Further, the court finds that the question on appeal, namely whether the defendant may be properly sentenced under the amended guidelines because he has pled guilty to a crime which continued beyond the effective date of the Indictment, is not a “substantial question.” As previously cited by the court, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that a defendant may be sentenced in accordance with the crime, as charged in the Indictment, to which he pled guilty to. See Morrison, 938 F.2d 168 (10th Cir.1991) (citing United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989)). Thus, because the issue raised by the defendant has been decided by controlling precedent, it may not be properly characterized a “substantial” question. Affleck, 765 F.2d at 952. Further, the court finds that reversal of this court’s decision will not lead to a new trial on all counts. Defendant Burger has never contested his conviction with respect to four of the five counts to which he pled guilty. Finally, reversal would simply lead to resentencing, which would not be a reduced sentence to a term of imprisonment less than the total of the time already served plus the expected duration of the appeal process. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the court finds that defendant Burger’s motion for bail pending appeal will be denied.
