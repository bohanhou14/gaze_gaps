The defendant’s statement made en route to arraignment is also inadmissible. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches only after the filing of formal charges, and since the defendant had not been charged at the time of the statement, it is protected by the Fifth Amendment rather than the Sixth. United States v. Duvall, 537 F.2d 15, 20-22 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 950, 96 S.Ct. 3173, 49 L.Ed.2d 1188 (1976).

The defendant had previously invoked his right to remain silent, and the subsequent questioning by the DEA agents was impermissible. The agents had no legitimate reason to ask the defendant why he had done something if he had not waived his right to remain silent. Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964).

The fact that the questioning occurred en route to arraignment, when it might be anticipated that counsel will be appointed at the arraignment, does not furnish a basis for excluding the statement. United States v. Ortega, 471 F.2d 1350, 1362 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 948, 93 S.Ct. 1924, 36 L.Ed.2d 409 (1973); United States v. Marrero, 450 F.2d 373 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 933, 92 S.Ct. 991, 30 L.Ed.2d 808 (1972).

In conclusion, the defendant’s statement made en route to arraignment is inadmissible due to the impermissible questioning by the DEA agents. The statement is also inadmissible due to the lack of a legitimate reason for the questioning. United States v. Duvall, 537 F.2d 15, 20-22 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 950, 96 S.Ct. 3173, 49 L.Ed.2d 1188 (1976).
