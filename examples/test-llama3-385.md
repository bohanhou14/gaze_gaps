The case of Whimsicality, Inc. v. Rubie's Costume Co., Inc. is a copyright infringement case that involves the registration of costumes with the United States Copyright Office. The plaintiff, Whimsicality, registered six costumes with the Copyright Office, describing them as "soft sculptures." The defendant, Rubie's, argued that the costumes were not copyrightable because they were useful and not separable artistic elements.

The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Rubie's, holding that the costumes were not copyrightable. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, finding that Whimsicality had committed inequitable conduct by misrepresenting the nature of the costumes to the Copyright Office.

Whimsicality filed a motion to reopen the record under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) to submit new evidence, including an affidavit from Frank Vítalos, a high-ranking official at the Copyright Office. The affidavit stated that the Office does not require applicants to identify each separate copyrightable element of a work and that Whimsicality's use of the term "soft sculpture" was not misleading.

In considering the motion, the District Court noted that the "law of the case" doctrine does not prevent it from considering new evidence, citing 925 F.2d 1010. The Court found that the Vítalos affidavit was relevant, noncumulative, and highly persuasive evidence that Whimsicality did not commit inequitable conduct.

The Court also considered the case of Roth v. Pritikin, 787 F.2d 54, which held that a prevailing defendant must demonstrate "something more" than the fact that it prevailed to recover costs and fees. The Court found that Rubie's did not meet this standard and refused to award it attorney's fees.

The Court ultimately granted Whimsicality's motion to reopen the record and vacated the judgment, finding that Whimsicality did not commit inequitable conduct and was entitled to enforce its copyrights. The Court also denied Rubie's motion for attorney's fees, citing the Second Circuit's remand and the lack of bad faith on Whimsicality's part.

In conclusion, the case highlights the importance of considering new evidence and the need for a party to demonstrate bad faith to recover costs and fees. It also underscores the significance of the "law of the case" doctrine in determining whether a court may reconsider a previous

gold_text: Finally, an award of statutory attorney fees would be inappropriate for a number of reasons separate and apart from the examiner’s affidavit. A prevailing defendant in an enforcement action may recover fees pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 505 if the action is frivolous or brought in bad faith. Roth v. Pritikin, 787 F.2d 54, 57 (2d Cir.1986). The authorities counsel that a reviewing court should act with caution before awarding fees to a prevailing defendant so as not to undermine the remedial purposes of the Copyright Act. See, e.g., Id.; Video Views, Inc. v. Studio 21, Ltd., 925 F.2d 1010, 1022 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, — U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 181, 116 L.Ed.2d 143 (1991). Without considering the information provided by Mr. Vítalos, this Court is not at liberty to alter the appellate court’s conclusion that Whimsicality has proceeded in bad faith by virtue of the characterization “soft sculpture” in its registration applications. Nevertheless, fees are inappropriate.
