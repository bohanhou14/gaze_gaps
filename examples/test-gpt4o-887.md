Seventh, appellants argue that the sentences imposed are excessive given the nature of their crimes and the ages of some defendants. The court has, however, upheld that a sentence within statutory limits is not considered cruel and unusual punishment and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of illegality or abuse of discretion (Page v. United States, 462 F.2d 932 (3rd Cir. 1972); 501 F.2d 1006). In this case, the record does not reveal any abuse of discretion or illegality in the sentences imposed.

Eighth, appellants contend that they should not have been sentenced under § 924(c) for carrying firearms during the commission of a felony. The Supreme Court has clarified that using a firearm in the commission of a felony under § 924(c) has distinct implications, separate from merely carrying a firearm (446 U.S. 398). Here, the evidence showed that the firearms were used to threaten the federal officers actively, justifying the application of § 924(c).

In conclusion, the appellants' convictions and sentences are affirmed. The district court acted within its discretion and within the bounds of the law in making its determinations and sentencing. The issues raised by the appellants do not demonstrate any legal error that would warrant a reversal of their convictions or sentences.

gold_text: Last, appellants argue that they were charged under the wrong statute and that the sentences they received constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Appellants’ assertion of cruel and unusual punishment must fail because the sentences they received were all within the statutory limits. United States v. MacClain, 501 F.2d 1006, 1013 (10th Cir.1974). However, Busic v. United States, 446 U.S. 398, 100 S.Ct. 1747, 64 L.Ed.2d 381 (1980) compels us to vacate the probationary sentences received by Afflerbach, John Cotton, and Michael Cotton for violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). Because these appellants were convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 111, which contains its own enhancement of sentence provision, their sentences cannot be further enhanced by § 924(c). Thus, although we affirm all the appellants’ convictions and sentences under § 111, we must vacate the sentences received by Afflerbach, John Cotton, and Michael Cotton under § 924(c).
