This case involves a Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) suit against the United States for damages resulting from a small aircraft crash at the Paul Windle Airport in Kansas. The claimants argue that the Government's publication of a misleading aeronautical chart caused pilot Galen Baird to overestimate the length of a lighted runway, leading to the crash. The district court dismissed the claim, finding that the chart's issuance fell within the discretionary-function exception of 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a).

In support of their argument, the claimants cite Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 73 S.Ct. 956, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953), which held that determinations made by executives or administrators in establishing plans, specifications, or schedules of operations are discretionary and not subject to suit. The claimants also rely on cases such as Reminga v. United States, 631 F.2d 449 (6th Cir. 1980), which found that the Government's publication of an inaccurate chart was discretionary and not actionable.

On the other hand, the Government argues that the claimants' challenge to the chart's design is an attack on the discretionary judgment of the Inter-Agency Air Cartographic Committee (IACC) in establishing the specifications for sectional aeronautical charts. The Government cites Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61, 76 S.Ct. 122, 100 L.Ed. 48 (1955), which held that the Government's discretionary decisions in establishing a program are not subject to suit.

In conclusion, the claimants' challenge to the chart's design is an attack on the discretionary judgment of the IACC, and the district court's dismissal of the claim is affirmed. The discretionary-function exception of 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a) applies to the Government's publication of a chart that conforms to the IACC's specifications.

gold_text: Simply put, plaintiffs challenge the Wichita sectional chart because it was too sketchy. This challenge thus goes to the heart of the IACC’s deliberative and judgmental activities in designing and approving the extent of detail to be included in aeronautical sectional charts versus the extent of detail left to be gleaned from other sources that the prudent pilot can be expected to consult. Such design and approval activities or choices by the Government fall within the discretionary-function exception and are not actionable under the Federal Tort Claims Act. See, e. g., Reminga v. United States, 631 F.2d 449, 454-56 (6th Cir. 1980) (activity in designing FAA regulations that do not require lighting or other warning markers on tower guy wires); Wright v. United States, 568 F.2d 153, 154 (10th Cir. 1977) (activity of Interior Department in designing approach roads to bridge), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 824, 99 S.Ct. 94, 58 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978); First National Bank v. United States, 552 F.2d 370, 376 (10th Cir. 1977) (activity of Agriculture Department in devising warning labels for pesticides and investigating dangers connected with prior use of such pesticides); Miller v. United States, 522 F.2d 386, 387 (6th Cir. 1975) (failure to adopt more strict air safety regulations); Spillway Marina, Inc. v. United States, 445 F.2d 876, 878 (10th Cir. 1971) (policy decision to lower reservoir’s water level created alleged need to give warnings; held Government’s omission within discretionary-function exception and not negligence at operational level). See also Payton v. United States, 636 F.2d 132,146-47 (5th Cir. 1981); Green v. United States, 629 F.2d 581, 585-86 (9th Cir. 1980). Contrary to the dissent, we believe that the IACC’s activities here are more analogous to those in cases like Reminga, Wright, First National, Miller, and Spillway, than to the operational activities in Indian Towing, Smith, Yates, or United Air Lines. We must therefore affirm the district court’s dismissal of plaintiffs’ claim.
