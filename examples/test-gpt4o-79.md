In support of the judgment in favor of the defendants, this Court finds consistency with precedents set in similar cases. Specifically, the case law established in 396 F.2d 730 informs the decision regarding state immunity and jurisdiction. The Court refrains from engaging in an analysis of Eleventh Amendment immunity, instead relying on the Civil Rights Statutes to confer jurisdiction, thereby supporting the denial of Wilson's claims. Additionally, in 365 F.2d 770, the principle that plaintiff's organizational affiliations do not render a dismissal unlawful if based on other legitimate reasons is reinforced. This precedent aligns with the finding that Wilson’s nonreemployment was due to permissible reasons unrelated to his association activities.

Furthermore, the procedural due process claims are addressed in line with the findings of 427 F.2d 319, where the refusal to rehire teachers was upheld by the court based on legitimate administrative decisions not violating constitutional rights. The jury in that case concluded that the decisions were made in good faith and without reference to the plaintiffs' race or protected conduct, similar to the current case's conclusion regarding Wilson’s nonreemployment.

Thus, the combined reasoning supported by these reference cases—396 F.2d 730, 365 F.2d 770, and 427 F.2d 319—bolsters the Court’s judgment granting in favor of the defendants. Plaintiffs have not sufficiently demonstrated that Wilson’s rights were violated, either procedurally or substantively.

It is so ordered.

gold_text: . Prior to the trial of this action, in their motion to dismiss, defendants raised the following contentions, inter alia: that the National Education Association lacked standing to bring this action; that Pleasant Hill School District R-III is not a “person” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and that the members of the Board of Education are not amenable to suit either in their individual or official capacities. As to these .contentions, see: Board of Trustees of Arkansas A & M College v. Davis, 396 F.2d 730, 734 (8th Cir. 1968) ; Smith v. Board of Education of Morrilton School District No. 32, 365 F.2d 770, 776-778 (8th Cir. 1966) ; and Harkless v. Sweeny Independent School District, 427 F.2d 319 (5th Cir. 1970), reversing 300 F.Supp. 794 (S.D.Tex. 1969). However, in light of the ultimate findings of this Court, a determination of defendants’ motion is not necessary.
