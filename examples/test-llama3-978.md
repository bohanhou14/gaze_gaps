Based on the information provided, it appears that there is a dispute about the effectiveness of an insurance contract between the parties. The applicant, Winslow, filled out an application for a policy of insurance on his life in favor of the appellant and her husband, but the policy was not issued due to the applicant's untimely death.

The court's decision in this case is guided by the principles established in reference case 117 U.S. 519, where it was held that an insurance company is bound by the statements made in an application, provided that the applicant is deemed to have read and understood the terms and conditions of the application. In this case, the application specifically stated that the proposed policy would not take effect unless the first premium was paid, and that a conditional receipt would have to be issued to make the insurance in force.

The court also refers to reference case 41 F.2d 684, where it was held that an insurance company is not liable for damages caused by an agent's unauthorized acts, unless the company has ratified those acts. In this case, the agent, Fred J. Moore, solicited and obtained the application, but the insurance company did not issue the policy.

Finally, the court notes that the case at hand is similar to reference case 73 F.2d 391, where the court held that an instrument must be accepted as the contract of the parties in an action at law, and that no contract of insurance ever became effective since no policy was issued.

Based on these principles, the court concludes that no contract of insurance was ever made between the parties, and that the insurance company is not liable for the applicant's death. The judgment appealed from should be affirmed.

gold_text: Appellant contends that such a contract resulted from oral conversations between Winslow and Moore prior to the. signing of Winslow’s application, and that such contract became effective on December 14, 1934. This contention must be rejected. Moore had no authority to make any contract for or on behalf of appellee. That Moore had no such authority was clearly and emphatically stated in the application which Winslow signed. The suggestion that Winslow did not read the application cannot be entertained. It was his duty to read it, and he is presumed to have done so. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Fletcher, 117 U.S. 519, 529, 6 S.Ct. 837, 29 L.Ed. 934. He is, therefore, presumed to have known that Moore had no authority to make the contract which appellant now says he did make. If, despite his lack of authority, Moore attempted to make such a contract, appellee was not and is not bound thereby. Bankers’ Reserve Life Co. v. Yelland, 9 Cir., 41 F.2d 684, 686; Braman v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 8 Cir., 73 F.2d 391, 393; Toth v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 123 Cal.App. 185, 192, 11 P.2d 94, 96.
