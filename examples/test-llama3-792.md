FAHY, Circuit Judge.
The defendant was convicted of carnally knowing a female child, as condemned by ยง 22-2801, D.C.Code (1940). The evidence indicates that the child, eight years old, was attacked by the defendant while her mother was away. The child initially denied the defendant's involvement, but later told her mother that he was the one who did it.

The defendant argues that the admission of the child's statement accusing him was prejudicial error. However, the court held that the statement was admissible to rebut the defendant's prior testimony that the child had stated she did not know who it was. The court relied on the principle that curative evidence is admissible to remove prejudice in the interest of fairness, citing cases such as Commonwealth v. Russ, 1919, 232 Mass. 58, 122 N.E, 176, 185, and Meyers v. United States, 9 Cir., 1945, 147 F.2d 663, 667.

The court also noted that the defendant had initiated the inquiry into the child's statements casting doubt upon his identity as the assailant, and therefore could not complain about the admission of the child's statement identifying him. This is similar to the case of Harris v. United States, 1920, 50 App.D.C. 139, 269 F. 481, where the court held that the admission of the child's statement to the policewoman was not prejudicial, despite the lack of objection.

In conclusion, the admission of the child's statement accusing the defendant was not prejudicial error, and the conviction is affirmed. This case is consistent with the principles of evidence law set forth in reference cases such as 126 F.2d 849, 299 F. 893, and 142 F.2d 85.

gold_text: Defendant also contends it was error to permit the child to testify over objection that defendant had abused her similarly on previous occasions. Evidence of such prior acts involving the same persons is admissible in prosecutions for sexual offenses. Hodge v. United States, 1942, 75 U. S.App.D.C. 332, 126 F.2d 849; Weaver v. United States, 1924, 55 App.D.C. 26, 299 F. 893; see, also, Bracey v. United States, 1944, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 23, 142 F.2d 85, certiorari denied 322 U.S. 762, 64 S.Ct. 1274, 88 L.Ed. 1589. This exception to the general rule excluding evidence of a crime for which a defendant is not on trial is qualified. Kidwell v. United States, 1912, 38 App.D.C. 566, 574. The qualification is that there must be independent evidence which points to the defendant as having committed the offense charged. As we have seen, this requirement is met in this case.
