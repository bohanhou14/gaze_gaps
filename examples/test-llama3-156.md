The cases referenced provide crucial insights into the interpretation of § 302(b) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947. In United States v. Ryan, 350 U.S. 299, the Supreme Court held that a union president who signs wage agreements negotiated by the union is a representative of employees within the meaning of § 302(b). Similarly, in United States v. Brennan, 240 F.2d 253, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that a union official who receives money from an employer in connection with the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement is a representative of employees under § 302(b).

In the present case, the defendant is charged with violating § 302(b) by receiving money from an employer in connection with the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement. The defendant argues that the indictment is vague and indefinite, but the court disagrees. The indictment provides sufficient details to inform the defendant of the charges against him and to enable him to prepare a defense.

The court also rejects the defendant's claim that the government must provide the exact date, place, and manner in which the defendant received and accepted the money. The court cites United States v. Smith, 16 F.R.D. 372, and United States v. Carb, 17 F.R.D. 242, for the proposition that the government is not required to furnish the names of witnesses or the evidence upon which it will rely at the trial.

In conclusion, the court finds that the indictment is sufficient to inform the defendant of the charges against him and that the government has met its burden of providing a detailed description of the offense. The court denies the defendant's motions to dismiss the indictment and for a bill of particulars.
