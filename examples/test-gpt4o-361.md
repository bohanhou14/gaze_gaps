**Generation:**

The plan's filing of its bankruptcy claim for withdrawal liability did not violate the automatic stay. According to § 362(a), initiations of proceedings against the debtor are generally stayed (26 B.R. 332). However, specific actions, such as the issuance of a tax deficiency notice, are exceptions to this automatic stay (850 F.2d 165). The Commonwealth's audit and notice were permitted despite the stay, provided it did not proceed to create a lien (850 F.2d 165). Similarly, here, the plan's act of filing its claim was within procedural allowances and did not extend to creating additional creditor pressure beyond notifying the debtor’s estate of the liability scope.

Moreover, compliance with procedural requirements in the bankruptcy context, such as attaching the necessary documents to claims (Rule 3001(c)), doesn't necessarily affect the substantive adequacy of notice under the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments (935 F.2d 120). Thus, any procedural defects would not invalidate the notice to Slotky, ensuring due process was substantially upheld (946 F.2d 1059).

Given that Slotky did not contest the notice within statutory timelines or initiate arbitration, his liability, inclusive of penalties and fees, stands affirmed under 29 U.S.C. § 1401(b)(1) (901 F.2d 127).

gold_text: As for the automatic stay, there is admittedly an analogy between an outright suit against the bankrupt, which would incontrovertibly violate the stay, § 362(a)(1), and a notice and demand that kicks off a sequence of conciliation and arbitration which may well result in an arbitrator’s order — equivalent to, because enforceable by, a legal judgment — against the bankrupt. The analogy may fail, for while the automatic stay probably applies to arbitra-tions equally with adjudications, In re T.D.M.A., Inc., 66 B.R. 992, 996 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1986); In re Cott Corp., 26 B.R. 332, 336 (Bankr.D.Conn.1982); H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 340-42 (1977) U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1978, pp. 5787, 6296-6298, an initial demand does not inaugurate a litigation or even create a lien (another act barred by the automatic stay. In re H & H Beverage Distributors, 850 F.2d 165, 167 (3d Cir.1988)). But even if the demand violated the automatic stay, all that this would mean, it seems to us, so far as bears on this case (for the violation might of course expose the violator to contempt proceedings, as with any other violation of a judicial order), is that the pension plan could not proceed against Stevens unless the bankruptcy judge lifted the stay. The demand would still be effective against nonbankrupt members of the controlled group, such as Slotky. So at least the cases hold, I.A.M. National Pension Fund v. Slyman Industries, Inc., 901 F.2d 127 (D.C.Cir.1990); McDonald v. Centra, Inc., 946 F.2d 1059, 1065 (4th Cir.1991), sensibly in our view, though there is a division of authority over whether in other settings a filing that violates the automatic stay can be given any legal effect. Pettibone Corp. v. Easley, 935 F.2d 120, 122 (7th Cir.1991).
