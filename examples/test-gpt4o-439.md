Defendant further argues that exceptional reasons exist for his release under 18 U.S.C. § 3145(c), due to his need to arrange personal affairs and consult medical professionals. However, this argument fails to meet the standard of "exceptional reasons" as defined by the Second Circuit in United States v. DiSomma, which requires "a unique combination of circumstances giving rise to situations that are out of the ordinary" (951 F.2d 494, 497). Purely personal circumstances, like those presented here, do not typically qualify as exceptional (United States v. Lea, 360 F.3d 401). 

Furthermore, district courts have considerable flexibility in applying this standard, but Defendant has not demonstrated any such unique combination of circumstances justifying his release. The district court must carefully balance the factors of flight risk and danger to the community, and Defendant's argument falls short based on his significant criminal history and the potential penalties he faces.

Therefore, Defendant's motion for release pending sentencing must be denied.

gold_text: Finally, even if Defendant could establish by clear and convincing, evidence that he does not present a risk of flight or danger, there are no exceptional reasons warranting Defendant’s release. His desire to get his affairs in order and speak to his medical professionals simply does not rise to the level of exceptional circumstances. See United States v. Lea, 360 F.3d 401, 403 (2d Cir.2004) (“Exceptional circumstances exist where there is ‘a unique combination of circumstances giving risé to situations that are out of the ordinary.”’) (quoting United States v. DiSomma, 951 F.2d 494, 497 (2d Cir.1991)).
