The jury instructions in this case were not erroneous. The district court correctly instructed the jury on the standard for employer liability in a hostile work environment claim, and the jury instructions were not misleading or incomplete. The court's instruction on the standard for intentional infliction of emotional distress was also correct, and the jury was adequately informed on the law.

In Japan Airlines Co. v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 178 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir.1999), the Second Circuit held that a jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law. Here, the jury instructions did not mislead the jury or fail to inform them on the law.

In Perry v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 115 F.3d 143, 153 (2d Cir.1997), the Second Circuit held that an omission or incomplete instruction is less likely to be prejudicial than a misstatement of the law. Here, the jury instructions were complete and did not omit any material information.

In Lore v. City of Syracuse, 670 F.3d 127, 156 (2d Cir.2012), the Second Circuit held that if the instructions, read as a whole, presented the issues to the jury in a fair and evenhanded manner, they do not warrant reversal. Here, the jury instructions presented the issues to the jury in a fair and evenhanded manner, and the court did not err in giving the instructions.

Therefore, the court's jury instructions were not erroneous, and the verdict is affirmed.
