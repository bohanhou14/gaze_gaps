The court's decision in the case is based on the interpretation of the insurance policy and the concept of "permissive use". The policy provides coverage for Carleton's "permissive use" of a boat that he does not own, but the policy does not define "permissive use". The court held that the scope of permission is an issue for the trier of fact, citing cases such as Drielick v. Drielick, 151 Mich.App. 665, 391 N.W.2d 435, 440 (1986) and Government Employees Ins. Co. v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 281 Va. 647, 708 S.E.2d 877, 884 (2011).

In the case of Drielick, the court held that whether a person has granted permission or whether a person has exceeded the scope of permission is a factual issue to be resolved by the fact-finder. Similarly, in Government Employees, the court held that permission for one use does not imply permission for all uses.

The court also cited cases such as Bronson Methodist Hosp. v. Forshee, 198 Mich.App. 617, 499 N.W.2d 423, 425-28 (1993), which involved a "chain of permissive use" and inquired whether a claimant's use of a vehicle was "unlawful" under MCL § 500.3113(a). However, the court noted that the facts of this case are distinguishable from those in Bronson.

The court's decision is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, which held that in determining whether a district court has jurisdiction over a case, the court should consider the "convenience of the parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice". The court's decision is also consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Gulf Oil Corp. v. United States, 491 U.S. 266, 109 S.Ct. 2527, 105 L.Ed.2d 277 (1989), which held that the court should consider the "convenience of the parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice" in determining whether a case should be transferred to a different court.

The court's decision is also consistent with the decision in Carbonic Prod. Co. v. Welding & Cutting Supply

gold_text: . The district court found that Michigan’s choice-of-law principles apply to this case. But because this case was transferred on convenience grounds, 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), there is good reason to question that determination. See Northland Ins. Co. v. Guardsman Prods., 141 F.3d 612, 616 (6th Cir.1998) (noting that when a diversity case is transferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), the "transferee court must apply the law of the state where the suit was originally filed, including that state’s choice of law rules”) (quoting Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 639, 84 S.Ct. 805, 11 L.Ed.2d 945 (1964)); see also Ferens v. John Deere Co., 494 U.S. 516, 519, 110 S.Ct. 1274, 108 L.Ed.2d 443 (1990). Nevertheless, the parties have applied Michigan’s choice-of-law principles.
