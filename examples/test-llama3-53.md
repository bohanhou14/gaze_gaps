In the context of a Chapter 13 cramdown, the court has held that the interest rate to be applied is the current conventional market rate used for similar loans in the region, and not necessarily the contract rate (315 F.3d 671). In determining the interest rate, the court must consider the contingency of nonpayment and the value of the collateral (301 F.3d 583). 

In the case at hand, Debtors seek to modify their confirmed plan to reduce the interest rate on secured creditors' claims to 12%. However, the court finds that the notice provided to secured creditors is inadequate. The notice does not clearly state that the rights of secured creditors are being modified, and the affected creditors are not given sufficient information to determine how their claims will be affected.

Furthermore, the court notes that the proposed modification does not provide notice of the date for hearing or opportunity for hearing to approve the plan modification. In order to provide meaningful due process notice, the court requires that the notice clearly state the modifications being proposed, the impact on each claim, and the date for hearing or opportunity for hearing (315 F.3d 671).

In conclusion, the court denies Debtors' motion to modify their confirmed Chapter 13 Plan and the rights of secured creditors Tran-south and Wilkes, as the notice provided is inadequate to provide meaningful due process notice to the affected creditors. The court finds that the confirmed plan and proposed modifications fail to provide sufficient notice, and the rights of secured creditors are not being adequately protected.
