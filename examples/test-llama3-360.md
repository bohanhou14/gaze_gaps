The cases of 371 U.S. 415, 310 U.S. 296, and 353 U.S. 232 provide valuable insights into the legal issues surrounding Canon 7(B)(1)(c) of the Arkansas Code of Judicial Conduct. In 371 U.S. 415, the Supreme Court held that the NAACP's legal staff and lawyers from the Defense Fund were not bound by the same rules as private attorneys, and that the staff and lawyers could represent clients in litigation involving public school segregation.

In 310 U.S. 296, the Court ruled that the Pennsylvania statute prohibiting the distribution of Jehovah's Witnesses' publications was unconstitutional, as it violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.

In 353 U.S. 232, the Court held that a state law limiting the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses was unconstitutional, as it violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.

In the context of Canon 7(B)(1)(c), these cases suggest that the canon's restrictions on a judicial candidate's ability to express their views on disputed legal or political issues may be unconstitutional. The canon's language, which prohibits candidates from making "pledges or promises of conduct in office other than the faithful and impartial performance of the duties of the office; announce his views on disputed legal or political issues; or misrepresent his identity, qualifications, present positions, or other fact," may be overly broad and vague, and could potentially chill a candidate's ability to express their views on important issues.

Furthermore, the canon's restrictions may be seen as a violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and association. As the Court stated in 310 U.S. 296, "the freedom to think as you will and to speak from your convictions as you will is surely the most comprehensive of all freedoms.”

In conclusion, the cases of 371 U.S. 415, 310 U.S. 296, and 353 U.S. 232 suggest that Canon 7(B)(1)(c) may be unconstitutional, and that judicial candidates should be allowed to express their views on disputed legal or political issues without fear of reprisal.

gold_text: The Court in Mortal further emphasized that there were three “specific evils targeted” by the Louisiana canon, namely, (1) the state’s desire to prevent abuse of judicial office by a judge-candidate during the campaign, (2) to preclude the abuse of the judicial office by a judge who was defeated in the electorial bid and returned to his judicial office and (3) the desire of eliminating any appearance of impropriety by judges during and after the campaign for the nonjudicial office. It is plain that the area that the State of Louisiana sought to regulate by implementing Canon 7(A)(3) is limited with “narrow specificity.” See: N.A.A.C.P. v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 338, 9 L.Ed.2d 405; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 311, 60 S.Ct. 900, 906, 84 L.Ed. 1213. In the instant case, Canon 7(B)(1)(c) is overbroad and vague and as such, has the force and effect of inhibiting unduly protected freedoms of expression. Judge Beshear in no way was advocating any unlawful activities or seeking to breach the peace in any way. Judge Beshear was endeavoring to voice ideas and policies that he would institute, if elected, to cope with the increasing crime rate. Obviously the policies would be implemented in open court and in the presence of all interested parties and not in secrecy or in an arbitrary or oppressive manner. Indeed, neither the Commission nor the State of Arkansas may, under the pretext of prohibiting professional misconduct, ignore basic and fundamental federal rights. See: Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 752, 1 L.Ed.2d 796.
