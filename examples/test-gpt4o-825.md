The issuance of a bargaining order by the Board, pursuant to NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, requires a stringent assessment of the employer's practices and their impact on the union's majority status. In this case, despite the Board's conclusion that the union had obtained a majority of valid authorization cards by September 16, 1977, and maintained its majority status through to the election, a bargaining order is not justified under the less extraordinary cases criteria outlined in Gissel. Specifically, for a bargaining order to be appropriate, as reiterated in cases such as N.L.R.B. v. Kane, 435 F.2d 1203, and N.L.R.B. v. American Cable Systems, Inc., 414 F.2d 661, there must be a showing that the possibility of ensuring a fair election through traditional remedies is slight, and that employee sentiment is better protected through such an order.

Here, the Board did not sufficiently demonstrate that the employer's past practices had such a pervasive impact that traditional electoral remedies were inadequate. The less pervasive nature of the unfair practices and the close election result suggest that electoral conditions could potentially be restored without resorting to a bargaining order. As established in N.L.R.B. v. Appletree Chevrolet, Inc., 608 F.2d 988, an election remains the preferred method of determining the bargaining agent, and the Board's issuance of a bargaining order must be reserved for circumstances where traditional remedies cannot suffice. Therefore, we find the Gissel bargaining order inappropriate under these circumstances and deny enforcement of this specific remedy.

gold_text: The Board, relying on NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), issued an order requiring that the election be set aside if a tally of the ballots showed that the union had lost the election and requiring that the company bargain with the union. Under Gissel, a bargaining order without an election is proper if the company is found to have committed outrageous and pervasive unfair labor practices. If, however, the unfair labor practices are found not to have been egregious, a bargaining order is proper only if it is shown that the union once had a majority support, that such support had been dissipated by the employerâ€™s pervasive misconduct, and that the possibility of erasing the effects of the unfair labor practices and ensuring a fair election is slight. NLRB v. Appletree Chevrolet, Inc., 608 F.2d 988 (4th Cir. 1979). The Board found that this case fell within the latter category-
