This matter emphasizes the principle that appellate courts rely on arguments and records developed by the parties. As noted in 714 F.2d 171, the foundation of our adversarial system mandates that counsel must present thorough arguments supported by the relevant authorities and portions of the record. The Commission's failure to address Reliance’s accuracy objections is akin to an appellant failing to address legal issues in an opening brief, forcing the court to derive conclusions without adequate guidance, which is both unjust and risks an improper ruling (800 F.2d 1208).

Moreover, the Commission’s duty to ensure the fairness and accuracy of the information's disclosure, as demanded by 15 U.S.C. § 2055, parallels the need for thorough and documented rationale in agency decisions, highlighted in 749 F.2d 856. The discernible guidance from precedent requires that the remand directs the Commission to substantiate why it finds no merit in Reliance's accuracy objections. This step ensures that the administrative record is adequately developed, preserving the integrity of judicial review and alignment with established procedural standards referenced in 800 F.2d 1208.

In conclusion, the court's decision highlights that the Commission must explicate its reasoning concerning Reliance's objections, ensuring adherence to statutory mandates and fairness in disclosure.

gold_text: With respect to the remaining documents listed in the district court’s order, Reliance’s letter cited pages 2-81 to 2-82 among the documents it contended would be unfair to disclose. But Reliance did not inform the Commission why this would be unfair. In this court appellants have not explained the nature of Reliance’s objections to these documents; so far as we can tell, they did not do so in the district court. We therefore decline to review the district court's order regarding these pages. See McBride v. Merrell Dow & Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 800 F.2d 1208, 1210-11 (D.C.Cir.1986); Carducci v. Regan, 714 F.2d 171, 177 (D.C.Cir.1983), quoting Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(4); Railway Labor Executives’ Ass'n v. U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, 749 F.2d 856, 859 n. 6 (D.C.Cir.1984).
