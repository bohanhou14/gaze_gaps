The case at hand is a complex one, involving the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and its preemption of state law claims. The plaintiff, Robin Karns, initially filed a breach of contract action in state court, alleging that the defendant, American United Life Insurance Company, wrongfully terminated her long-term disability benefits.

The defendants removed the case to federal court, citing federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The court must determine whether the claims are completely preempted by ERISA, as alleged by the defendants.

In this case, we must consider the four-part test established in Butero v. Royal Maccabees Life Ins. Co., 174 F.3d 1207 (11th Cir. 1999). The test requires the court to determine whether the plan is an ERISA plan, whether the plaintiff has standing to sue, whether the defendant is an ERISA entity, and whether the complaint seeks compensatory relief akin to that available under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a).

Here, the court finds that all four elements are satisfied. The policy at issue is an ERISA plan, and the plaintiff has standing to sue. The defendant is an ERISA entity, and the complaint seeks compensatory relief for alleged bad faith in the administration of the plan.

Therefore, the court holds that the claims are completely preempted by ERISA, and that federal question jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. This is consistent with previous decisions in this circuit, such as Langley v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 2:06-cv-786-VEH (N.D. Ala. June 29, 2006).

In conclusion, the court denies the motion to remand and will proceed with the case. The reference cases that support this conclusion include 276 F.3d 1292, 279 F.3d 1289, 174 F.3d 1207, 868 F.2d 430, and 833 F.2d 277. These cases all support the proposition that ERISA preempts state law claims related to employee benefit plans.

We have held on more than one occasion, in precedent binding on this Circuit that the saving clause does not apply to this tort.” Gilbert v. Alta Health & Life Ins. Co., 276 F.3d 1292, 1299 (11th Cir.2001). See also, Walker v. S. Co. Servs. Inc., 279 F.3d 1289, 1294 (11th Cir.2002); Butero v. Royal Maccabees Life Ins. Co., 174 F.3d 1207, 1215 (11th Cir.1999); Amos v. Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Ala., 868 F.2d 430 (11th Cir.1989); Belasco v. W.K.P. Wilson & Sons, Inc., 833 F.2d 277, 281 (11th Cir.1987). Consequently, bad faith tort claims are also preempted by ERISA.
