Defendant's situation closely mirrors Cuoco's case (208 F.3d 27), where Cuoco voluntarily chose to absent himself from jury selection despite being informed by the court of the consequences. In the referenced case, the court highlighted that a defendant has the right to be present at jury selection as it signifies the trial’s commencement (Lewis v. United States, 146 U.S. 370). The finding was that Cuoco, by leaving, knowingly waived this right. Similarly, despite the magistrate and judge advising Defendant of the implications, he persisted in his decision to leave. 

Further, the Supreme Court in Crosby (506 U.S. 255) affirmed that proceeding with the trial in the defendant’s absence was permissible when the absence was deliberate, aiming to prevent disruption in trials involving multiple parties and witnesses. In Defendant’s case, the judge confirmed the waiver with Defendant repeatedly, reflecting the due diligence similar to that in the Crosby proceedings.

Therefore, the District Court appropriately exercised its discretion, determining that Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right. The court’s actions balanced the public interest, ensuring the trial’s progression without undue delays.

gold_text: On the facts before us, the District Court did not err in concluding that Defendant waived his right to be present for jury selection and that continuing with jury selection was in the public interest. See Cuoco v. United States, 208 F.3d 27, 32 (2d Cir.2000); see also Crosby v. United States, 506 U.S. 255, 262, 113 S.Ct. 748, 122 L.Ed.2d 25 (1993) (noting that if a defendant fled after the start of trial, the defendant would know that the likely consequence would be that the trial would continue in his absence). Defendant’s argument, therefore, fails.
