Based on the legal cases, I notice that the issue of jurisdiction is a crucial aspect in determining the validity of a claim. In the case of Reference case 424 U.S. 392, the Court of Claims was faced with a challenge to its jurisdiction over a claim involving a breach of contract. The court held that the Tucker Act, which grants jurisdiction to the Court of Claims, requires a source of substantive law that creates a right to money damages. The court further emphasized that the language of the Tucker Act does not create a substantive cause of action, but rather provides a jurisdictional basis for the court to hear claims.

In Reference case 402 F.3d 1167, the court addressed the issue of whether a statute or regulation is "money-mandating" for jurisdictional purposes. The court cited the Mitchell test, which requires that a statute or regulation can be fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for damages sustained as a result of a breach of duties.

In the case at hand, I believe that the Court of Federal Claims correctly dismissed Mr. Evans's complaint for failure to state a claim. The court's decision was based on the fact that Mr. Evans did not plead factual content or otherwise identify any record evidence demonstrating the Government's intent to pay him interest accrued on the seized funds. The court also noted that Mr. Evans failed to demonstrate an implied-in-fact contract with the Government for interest accrued on the seized funds.

In conclusion, the jurisdictional issues in this case are critical in determining the validity of Mr. Evans's claim. The court's decision was based on the lack of a "money-mandating" source of substantive law and the failure to demonstrate an implied-in-fact contract with the Government. Therefore, I believe that the Court of Federal Claims' decision to dismiss Mr. Evans's complaint was correct.

gold_text: Second, Mr. Evans avers that he established an implied-in-fact contract with the Government based on a disgorgement theory. Appellant’s Br. 13. However, Mr. Evans does not explain how this disgorgement theory satisfies his burden of demonstrating mutuality of intent or any of the other elements of an implied-in-fact contract. See generally id. To the extent Mr. Evans attempts to raise an independent claim for disgorgement, he has not identified a money-mandating source of substantive law, as required by the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). See United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976) (“The Tucker Act ... is itself only a jurisdictional statute; it does not create any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages.”); Fisher v. United States, 402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (stating that, to establish Tucker Act jurisdiction, “a plaintiff must identify a separate source of substantive law that creates the right to money damages” (citations omitted)). Therefore, the Court of Federal Claims would not have had jurisdiction to adjudicate such a claim.
