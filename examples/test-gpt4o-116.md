The court in Morton v. Gardner, 257 F.Supp. 67, 74 (380 F.2d 940) emphasized that employers are concerned with an employee's health, psychological stability, and steady attendance. Thus, hiring practices often preclude hiring individuals with substantial physical impairments based on increased insurance costs. Given the uncontested medical evidence, it was clear that the plaintiff's various conditions collectively prevent him from engaging in his previous type of work or any future employment.

Furthermore, the decision in Teeter v. Flemming, 270 F.2d 871, 874 (380 F.2d 940) highlights that expert medical opinions, even if not binding, must be considered unless substantial evidence to the contrary exists. Here, the examiner overlooked significant medical evidence supporting the plaintiff’s total disability.

Additionally, according to Wimmer v. Celebrezze, 355 F.2d 289 (365 F.2d 425), the geographic availability of employment opportunities relevant to the claimant’s background and residual capacities should be reasonably considered. However, the examiner's omission of substantial conflicting evidence renders the said decision unsupported.

Given the interplay of these conditions with established legal precedent, the plaintiff’s impairments clearly preclude substantial gainful employment, and the Secretary’s decision must be reversed.

gold_text: It might be said that there are other jobs of a light or sedentary nature, or perhaps observational jobs, which plaintiff could perform. The hearing examiner found that plaintiff could perform light to moderate work. There was no showing of what other jobs plaintiff could perform and it seems highly unlikely that other employment opportunities actually exist for someone with plaintiff’s characteristics. This court realizes that employers are reluctant to hire persons who will create insurance problems. They are unlikely to run the risk of increasing their workmen’s compensation insurance costs. An employer would be even more unlikely to hire someone who is uninsurable, as this plaintiff might well be. Sayers v. Gardner, 380 F.2d 940 (6th Cir. 1967); Thomas v. Celebrezze, supra. The courts also are cognizant that employers are concerned with substantial capacity to perform and steady attendance. Thomas v. Celebrezze, supra. The record here clearly demonstrates that plaintiff has recurring attacks of asthma. Chronic absenteeism resulting from plaintiff’s asthmatic condition would certainly affect his employment opportunities. The following language of pertinent application is found in Cooke v. Celebrezze, 365 F.2d 425 (4th Cir. 1966):
