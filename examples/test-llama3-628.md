In this case, Pinter claims that Dahl, a sophisticated investor, is equally culpable for the failure to register the securities and should be barred from recovery under the doctrine of in pari delicto. The court disagrees, citing Henderson v. Hayden, 461 F.2d 1069 (5th Cir.1972), which held that a plaintiff seeking a return of consideration paid for unregistered securities under section 12(1) cannot be estopped by virtue of his having been aware that the securities were unregistered.

The court also notes that the doctrine of in pari delicto is inapplicable here, as Dahl's conduct was not "offensive to the dictates of natural justice." Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., 290 U.S. 240, 54 S.Ct. 146, 78 L.Ed. 293 (1933). Additionally, the court finds that Dahl's conduct was not "culpable" in the sense that his actions were not willful misconduct, but rather an equal producing cause of the illegal transaction.

The court also addresses Pinter's claim that Dahl is a "seller" of securities under section 12(1), citing Swenson v. Engelstad, 626 F.2d 421, 424 (5th Cir.1980), which held that a "seller" is one who parts with title to securities in exchange for consideration or one whose participation in the buy-sell transaction is a substantial factor in causing the transaction to take place.

In this case, the court finds that Dahl's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the other plaintiffs to purchase securities from Pinter. The court cites Pharo v. Smith, 621 F.2d 656, 667 (5th Cir.1980), and Hill York Corp. v. American International Franchises, Inc., 448 F.2d 680, 692-93 (5th Cir.1971), for the proposition that a "seller" is one whose participation in the buy-sell transaction is a substantial factor in causing the transaction to take place.

In conclusion, the court finds that Dahl is not barred from recovery under the doctrine of in pari delicto and that he is a "seller" of securities under section 12(1). The court's decision is based on the principles outlined in Henderson v. Hayden, Keystone Driller Co. v.

gold_text: Notwithstanding our conclusion that Dahl meets the substantial factor test, we decline to hold that he is a “seller” for the purposes of section 12(1). The substantial factor test was formulated and has been applied under facts which differ substantially from the facts of this case. In every case we have found employing this test (or its substantial equivalent), the person sought to be held liable as a “seller” received or hoped to receive some financial benefit from his efforts. See, e.g., Junker v. Crory, 650 F.2d 1349 (5th Cir.1981) (corporate attorney acting in capacity as agent of seller); Croy v. Campbell, 624 F.2d 709 (5th Cir.1980) (attorney-accountant who was paid for investment advice); Lewis v. Walston & Co., 487 F.2d 617 (5th Cir.1973) (investment broker); Hill York Corp., 448 F.2d 680 (compensated agents of the issuer). We believe that had this circuit previously been confronted with a promot er of unregistered securities whose efforts were intended to benefit neither the seller nor himself, we would have created a different test. That test would have incorporated a threshold requirement that the promoter be motivated by a desire to confer a direct or indirect benefit on someone other than the person he has advised to purchase. We believe that a rule imposing liability (without fault or knowledge) on friends and family members who give one another gratuitous advice on investment matters unreasonably interferes with well-established patterns of social discourse. Absent express direction by Congress, we decline to impose liability for mere gregariousness.
