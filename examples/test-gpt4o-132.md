**Generation:**

In evaluating Metz's arguments, we find no merit in his contentions. The Board correctly applied the law concerning evidentiary requirements and procedural matters. As referenced in 244 F.3d 1337, the presumption of regularity applies to evidentiary and procedural determinations, ensuring that all decisions regarding evidence were properly considered. Similar to the veteran benefits adjudication in 38 U.S.C. § 5107(a) and (b), the Board's treatment of the affidavits from Metz's colleagues falls within its procedural discretion and was properly executed.

Moreover, in line with the Supreme Court's ruling in 272 U.S. 1, the judgments of the original adjudicating body hold a presumption of correctness, providing a solid foundation for the Board's decision to deny Metz's disability benefits due to procedural and evidentiary sufficiency.

Metz's argument relying on Mondzelewski v. Pathmark Stores is misplaced; the Board thoroughly examined his individual circumstances and determined that his disabilities did not sufficiently impair his job performance to qualify for disability benefits. The application of appropriate procedural and evidentiary standards clearly supports the Board's decision.

Therefore, based on the correct application of procedural presumptions and the scrutiny of evidentiary submissions, we find no instance of a substantial departure from significant procedural rights or misconstruction of governing legislation. Consequently, the decision by the Merit Systems Protection Board is affirmed. Each party is to bear its own costs.

AFFIRMED

gold_text: Metz has not demonstrated “a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.” Lindahl, 470 U.S. at 791. First, the record reflects receipt of Metz’s coworkers’ affidavits by the AJ. We presume that the AJ reviewed that evidence, as she stated that she considered all the evidence of record. See Butler v. Principi, 244 F.3d 1337, 1340 (Fed.Cir.2001) (absent evidence to the contrary, public officials are presumed to have properly discharged their official duties) (citing United States v. Chem. Found., Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14-15, 47 S.Ct. 1, 71 L.Ed. 131 (1926)). Moreover, Metz has not produced evidence that the affidavits were not considered, except the inference by silence, which is insufficient. The failure of the AJ to specifically mention those affidavits in her opinion does not mean that they were not considered. Secondly, Metz’s contention that the Board’s disability decision was not focused on his case has no merit. The AJ carefully considered Metz’s particular medical evidence, including physician reports. See Metz I at 9-11. As explained above, we are not free to review the AJ’s factual determinations; we can only ensure that the administrative process was not irregular, and we affirm the Board’s decision because it was not.
