The legal cases presented here involve a towage contract between libelant and respondent, where the tug "Meteor" was supposed to tow the barge "B. H. 3" from Norfolk, Virginia to Jacksonville, Florida. The contract did not specify a date or time for completion of the voyage, and the parties did not agree on a specific date. The case highlights the importance of considering the implied terms of a contract, including the duty of the tower to exercise reasonable care and skill in the performance of the contract.

In this case, the Court found that libelant was negligent in the navigation and handling of the tug and barge, which resulted in a grounding in Bay River, N. C., and a 24-hour delay in the voyage. The Court also found that respondent's actions in preventing further performance of the contract by libelant were a breach of the towage contract, for which respondent is liable to libelant for damages in the sum of $860.

The Court's decision is consistent with the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which states that if an accident occurs under circumstances in which it would not have occurred had the proper care been exercised, there is a prima facie case of negligence against the party who had control of the situation. This doctrine has been applied in various admiralty cases, including The Anaconda, 164 F.2d 224, and The Wyomissing, 228 F. 186.

Furthermore, the Court's decision emphasizes the importance of considering the implied terms of a contract, including the duty of the tower to exercise reasonable care and skill in the performance of the contract. This is in line with the ruling in The Arlington, 19 F.2d 285, 286, 54 A.L.R. 101, which states that a towage contract implies a promise to prosecute the voyage with due diligence and complete it within a reasonable time.

In conclusion, the case highlights the importance of considering the implied terms of a contract and the duty of the tower to exercise reasonable care and skill in the performance of the contract. The Court's decision is consistent with the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur and previous admiralty cases, and serves as a reminder of the need for parties to be aware of their obligations and responsibilities under a towage contract.

gold_text: In a case such as this, where the towed vessel is unmanned, the tower is clearly and solely responsible for the safe navigation of the tug and tow. The tower is always charged with responsibility for knowledge of the conditions of navigation in the waters where the tug operates, including knowledge of channels, depth of water, obstructions, shoals and other dangers known generally to men experienced in navigation. The Severance, 4 Cir., 152 F.2d 916, certiorari denied [Stone v. Diamond Steamship Transportation Corp.], 328 U.S. 853, 66 S.Ct. 1344, 90 L.Ed. 1626. Although an injury to the tow raises no presumption of fault on the part of the tug, 86 C.J.S., Towage, ยง 34, the cases hold that evidence of grounding of a barge or other vessel in tow of a tug establishes a prima facie case of negligence on the part of the tug.
