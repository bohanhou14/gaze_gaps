Clemente's pro se request also invokes Rule 60(b)(6) for relief from the judgment to file a timely notice of appeal. Clemente's contentions fail to meet the criteria for relief under Rule 60(b)(6) as interpreted by the relevant case law. This Circuit reserves Rule 60(b)(6) for "exceptional or extraordinary circumstances" (Pierce v. United Mine Workers, 770 F.2d 449, 451, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1104). Claims of strictly legal error generally fall under Rule 60(b)(1) and are thus not appropriate grounds for 60(b)(6) relief unless exceptional circumstances exist (Reference case: 867 F.2d 291). Clemente's failure to present new evidence or arguments does not justify invoking Rule 60(b)(6).

Additionally, the effort to secure relief under Rule 60(b)(6) by arguing excusable neglect fails, given the precedent that "excusable neglect" does not extend beyond one year (Reference case: 340 U.S. 193). As in Kelly v. United States, circumstances similar to those presented by Clemente, including reliance on legal advice, do not suffice (Reference case: 340 U.S. 193). Hence, the Court finds no justifiable reason to reconsider its July 31, 1997, order denying the motion for a new trial and to amend the judgment.

In light of the above, Clemente’s pro se requests for certification of appealability and for relief from judgment are hereby denied.

CONCLUSION

The Court orders that plaintiff be awarded $54,283.75 in attorneys’ fees and $3,479.30 in costs. Clemente’s pro se motions are denied.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

gold_text: Further, Clemente moves the Court for relief from judgment in order to file a timely notice of appeal. It is apparent that Clemente is seeking to use Rule 60(b) in order to obtain relief which could have been obtained on direct appeal from either the entry of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (Doc. 106) and Judgment Entry (Doc. 107) or the denial of the first post-judgment motion, or both. It is well-settled that a motion under Rule 60(b) may not be used as a substitute for appeal. Hopper v. Euclid Manor Nursing Home, Inc., 867 F.2d 291, 294 (6th Cir.1989); see also Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198, 71 S.Ct. 209, 95 L.Ed. 207 (1950) (noting that a Rule 60(b) motion should not be used to obtain by the Rule that which should have been sought via direct appeal).
