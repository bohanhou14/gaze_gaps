II. Merits

The ADA and the MHRA prohibit discrimination against qualified individuals on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); Minn. Stat. § 363A.08. To succeed under these statutes, Cover must prove she was both disabled and qualified to perform the essential job functions, with or without reasonable accommodation (Kiel v. Select Artificials, Inc., 169 F.3d 1131, 1134-35 (8th Cir.1999)). Key to her claim is whether she could perform essential functions of the available positions at JCP with reasonable accommodation.

Cover contends she was qualified for a cashier role with a plastic bag separator device. However, JCP argued, and the evidence shows, that both the SS and CSA positions had essential functions beyond cashiering, such as zoning and moving merchandise (PI. Ex. 8 at 5). The job of CSA required extensive zoning, while the SS role involved significant walking and carrying larger items, tasks that Cover could not perform (see JCP Ex. 18 at Interrog. No. 5).

Relying on the precedent set in Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 950 (8th Cir.1999), the Court finds JCP was not obligated to create a new position exclusively for cashiering. Employers are not required to eliminate essential functions or create new roles (Dropinski v. Douglas Cnty., Neb., 298 F.3d 704, 710 (8th Cir.2002)). Furthermore, in line with the decision in Cannice v. Norwest Bank Iowa N.A., 189 F.3d 723, 727-28 (8th Cir.1999), Cover failed to show evidence that she could perform these duties with reasonable accommodation. Therefore, Cover is not a qualified individual under the ADA or MHRA.

CONCLUSION

Based on the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED that JCP’s Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 25) is GRANTED and Cover’s Complaint (Doc. No. 3) is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. LET JUDGMENT BE ENTERED ACCORDINGLY.

gold_text: .Cover insists this device would have enabled her to cashier on her own, but she fails to submit any evidence supporting this assertion. "The employee [ ] carries the burden of showing that a particular accommodation rejected by the employer would have made the employee qualified to perform the essential functions of the job.” Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 954 (8th Cir.1999); accord Stafne v. Unicare Homes, 266 F.3d 771, 774 (8th Cir.2001). The only evidence in the record regarding this device is Brooks’s blind estimation that it costs around $100. (Brooks Dep. 60-61.) Yet, he also testified in his deposition that JCP did not have "the resources in the store to provide a bag separator.” (Id. 60.) Hence, there being no evidence proffered that a plastic bag separator device would have tillo wed her to-cashier, Cover has failed to meet her burden.
