II. The Regulation is Not Arbitrary and Capricious

Treasury's regulation must also survive scrutiny under the arbitrary and capricious standard as outlined in the State Farm case. A regulation will meet this standard if the agency has provided a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made. In assessing this, we examine whether Treasury considered the relevant factors and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action, see Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass’n of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983).

In our assessment of Treasury’s regulation defining "present value," we look to analogous cases to guide our interpretation. For example, in Gresham v. Commissioner, 79 T.C. 322 (1982), the Tax Court invalidated a regulation that inadequately accounted for market restrictions impacting stock value, a decision maintained on appeal (752 F.2d 518). This exemplifies that regulatory definitions must align closely with realistic economic conditions affecting taxpayers.

The Balestras argue that failing to consider an employer’s bankruptcy contravenes realistic valuation tactics similarly to how disregarding securities restrictions failed in Gresham (764 F.2d 322). However, Treasury’s choice to exclude bankruptcy contingencies aims to maintain a general and practical approach, ensuring a stable and predictable tax base without the need for intricate and variable financial health assessments.

We conclude that Treasury has adequately justified its regulation within the permissible bounds of its authority. Consequently, the regulation is neither arbitrary nor capricious, but instead aligns with established legal principles and regulatory practices.

gold_text: A similar point can be made with respect to McDonald v. Commissioner, 764 F.2d 322 (5th Cir.1985) and Estate of Gresham v. Commissioner, 752 F.2d 518 (10th Cir.1985). The Balestras rely on both cases, but these out-of-circuit cases are neither binding nor persuasive. Both cases involve the invalidation of a Treasury regulation when the related statute explicitly required consideration of fair market value. The statute in this case never references “fair market value.” Moreover, in this instance, there is no unambiguous intent or purpose requiring such a valuation.
