**Generation:**



The case of Hempt Bros., Inc. v. United States (354 F.Supp. 1172, 1973) presents a unique scenario where the taxpayer, a corporation, transferred its assets, including accounts receivable, to a new corporation in exchange for stock. The taxpayer argues that the Commissioner's assessment of tax liabilities is incorrect, citing the assignment of income doctrine and the tax benefit rule.

The court held that the Commissioner's assessment was correct, citing the non-recognition provision of Section 351, which states that no gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a corporation solely in exchange for stock or securities. The court also noted that the taxpayer's argument was based on a misunderstanding of the assignment of income doctrine, which is not applicable in this case.

Furthermore, the court held that the tax benefit rule is not applicable in this case, citing Nash v. United States (398 U.S. 1, 1970) and other cases. The court stated that the tax basis of the property exchanged remained zero, as it was expensed on the cash basis books of the partnership.

In conclusion, the court's decision in Hempt Bros., Inc. v. United States (354 F.Supp. 1172, 1973) is consistent with the principles of taxation, including the non-recognition provision of Section 351 and the tax benefit rule. The court's decision also highlights the importance of accurately applying tax laws and regulations to ensure fairness and consistency in taxation.

gold_text: . Du Pont v. United States, supra, at 1214, citing P. A. Birren & Son, Inc. v. Commissioner, 116 F.2d 718 (7th Cir. 1940), observed that nonrecognition under Section 351 has been granted for accounts receivable. In the recent case of Thatcher v. Commissioner, 61 T.C. 28 (42 U.S.L.W. 2228, October 30, 1973), the Tax Court reaffirmed its decision in Raich v. Commissioner, 46 T. C. 604 (1966), holding that accounts receivable transferred by a cash basis taxpayer to a corporation under Section 351 had a zero basis. By placing a tax basis in that which was transferred, the Tax Court by implication assumed that accounts receivable are “property” within the meaning of Section 351.
