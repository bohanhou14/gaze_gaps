The controversy in this case revolves around the constitutionality of the Indiana Gross Income Tax Act of 1933, which was imposed on the plaintiff, a non-resident corporation, for the gross income received from the sale of cross-ties to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. The plaintiff contends that the tax is invalid under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment because it was laid upon an event occurring outside the territorial limits of Indiana and beyond the jurisdiction of the taxing authorities.

The court in Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, 304 U.S. 307 (1938), held that the tax in that case was a tax on the receipt of gross income, rather than a tax on the privilege of doing business or deriving income from a source within the state. Similarly, in the instant case, the court concludes that the taxable event was the receipt of gross income, which occurred in Pennsylvania, and was beyond the jurisdiction of the State of Indiana to tax.

Furthermore, the court holds that the tax is invalid because it was laid without allocation or apportionment upon business activities both within and without the State of Indiana. The court notes that the plaintiff's income was derived from business engaged in and from a source within Indiana, as well as from sources outside the state, and that there was no method provided by the Act or otherwise for allocating the tax to the income derived from that part of the business transacted in Indiana.

In addition, the court concludes that the tax is a direct burden on interstate commerce, and is of a type that subjects commerce to the risk of multiple taxation of like kind in other states. The court cites cases such as Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U.S. 250 (1938), and United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, 223 U.S. 335 (1912), which have held that the commerce clause prohibits states from laying taxes on interstate commerce.

In conclusion, the court holds that the Indiana Gross Income Tax Act of 1933 is unconstitutional and invalid as applied to the plaintiff, a non-resident corporation, for the gross income received from the sale of cross-ties to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. The court's decision is based on the grounds that the tax is laid upon an event occurring outside the territorial limits of Indiana, and that it is a direct burden on interstate commerce. <answer>

gold_text: We reach the conclusion that the transactions in question were had in interstate commerce. It does not always follow, however, that interstate commerce is immune from taxation. Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U.S. 250, 254, 255, 58 S.Ct. 546, 82 L.Ed. 823, 115 A.L.R. 944; Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 305 U.S. 434, 438, 59 S.Ct. 325, 83 L.Ed. 272. Both of these cases, however, stand for the rule often announced, that state taxation, whatever its form, is precluded if it discriminates against interstate commerce.
