In evaluating Birks's claim that her termination was retaliatory, the court must examine if Jack Ingram Motors' stated reason for her discharge is pretextual. Birks must show that the reason given—her absence from work—is not the true reason but a cover for retaliation. Per 106 F.3d 1519, the court considers all evidence submitted by the plaintiff in making this evaluation but does not revisit the existence of the prima facie case itself. Birks has argued that the real reason for her termination was her complaint about pay discrepancies and hostile behavior, which constitutes protected activity under Title VII.

However, Jack Ingram Motors has supported its decision by highlighting Birks's unapproved departure and subsequent no-show, which could be viewed as validating its actions. Indeed, as in reference case 637 F.2d 1014, an employer acting in good faith is not obligated to probe every possible logical assumption before deciding. The burden lies with Birks to provide evidence strong enough to make a reasonable jury disbelieve Jack Ingram Motors' nondiscriminatory reasons.

Given the close temporal proximity between her complaints and termination, a jury could infer retaliation. However, without more substantive proof countering the legitimacy of Jack Ingram Motors' stated reason, Birks fails to conclusively demonstrate pretext.

Therefore, Jack Ingram Motors's motion for summary judgment on Birks's retaliatory discharge claim will also be granted.

gold_text: In her efforts to prove that her former employer’s reason is pretextual, Birks points out that Sloan Roberts, a male employee at Jack Ingram Motors, had previously been allowed to return to his position after having walked off the job. Yet Ingram, the company president, has testified that Roberts, in contrast to Birks, had subsequently provided evidence from his medical providers regarding his health problems and that Ingram thought that he was legally obligated, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12101-12213, to allow Roberts to return. “ ‘[A] plaintiff employee may not establish that an employer’s proffered reason is pretextual merely by questioning the wisdom of the employer’s reason’ as long as ‘the reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer.’ ” Penning ton, 261 F.3d at 1267 (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1543 (11th Cir.1997)). After having conducted an investigation, Ingram concluded that Birks’s allegations were groundless, and the record does not indicate that such a conclusion was unfounded. Phillips v. Joint Legislative Comm., 637 F.2d 1014, 1031 n. 52 (5th Cir.1981) (“[T]here is a point at which Title VII does not require an employer otherwise acting in good faith to verify every possible logical assumption on which he might rely.”). With regards to Roberts, it was reasonable for Jack Ingram Motors to excuse his unprofessional conduct after having been presented with his health-related reasons documented by medical professionals. In the end, Roberts’s and Birks’s situations are not similar enough to show that Jack Ingram Motors’s reason for not continuing Birks’s employment was pretextual.
