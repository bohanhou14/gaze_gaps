The district court's misjoinder ruling requires closer examination. In its decision, the district court overlooked established jurisprudence on the proper handling of misjoinder. As stated in George v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, a district court should not dismiss a misjoined complaint with prejudice but should instead use severance or dismissal without prejudice to manage such cases. This aligns with the principle that Rule 18's joinder of claims operates independently of Rule 20's joinder of parties, as clarified in Intercon Research Assocs., Ltd. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 696 F.2d 53. Additionally, Rule 20 requires that all joined parties' claims arise from the same transaction or occurrence, and share common legal or factual questions. The plaintiffs' assorted claims only superficially satisfy this requirement.

Moreover, the proper remedy for misjoinder has been elaborated further in Lovelace v. Lee, 795 F.3d 748, which reiterates that severance or docket management through dismissal without prejudice, rather than outright dismissal with prejudice, is appropriate in such scenarios.

Given these precedents, we reverse the district court's dismissal with prejudice and remand for further consideration under the proper procedural framework.

gold_text: These rules are broad, giving district courts considerable flexibility in managing and structuring civil litigation for fair and efficient resolution of complex disputes. Still, there are limits. "Unrelated claims against different defendants belong in different suits." George v. Smith , 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007). A district judge necessarily has considerable discretion in applying Rules 18 and 20. The rules "operate[ ] independently" because Rule 20 contains limitations that Rule 18 does not, and the Rule 20 inquiry comes first. See Pace v. Timmermann's Ranch & Saddle Shop Inc. , 795 F.3d 748, 755 n.10 (7th Cir. 2015), citing Intercon Research Assocs., Ltd. v. Dresser Industries, Inc. , 696 F.2d 53, 56-57 (7th Cir. 1982) (" Rule 18 becomes relevant only after the requirements of Rule 20 relating to joinder of parties [have] been met").
