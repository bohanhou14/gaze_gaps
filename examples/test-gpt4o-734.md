Given this legislative and judicial background, we turn to the plaintiffs' argument that their claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty should transcend the exclusivity of the Workers’ Compensation Act. Plaintiffs argue that their injuries were distinct and arose from intentional concealments by GE's medical personnel rather than direct workplace exposure.

However, the precedent decisions elucidate a different path. In Foley v. Polaroid Corporation, 381 Mass. 545 (1980), the Massachusetts courts drew clear lines that injuries requiring mental or physical harm as essential elements fall under the purview of the Workers’ Compensation Act. Thus, irrespective of the misrepresentation claims, the resulting injuries here — cancers and severe illnesses — are inherently tied to workplace exposure and conditions, thus necessitating coverage exclusively via the Act (see also Woods v. Friction Materials, 30 F.3d 255, 263 (1st Cir.1994)).

Moreover, this court must avoid formulating unprecedented jurisprudence or distorting state law interpretations. As emphasized in Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d 731 (1st Cir.1990) and Mack v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179 (1st Cir.1989), courts must adhere closely to existing legal frameworks rather than creating new legal principles based on perceived equities.

Accordingly, the exclusivity provision of the Massachusetts Workers’ Compensation Act, as articulated in statutory provisions and supported by consistent judicial interpretation, compels the dismissal of plaintiffs' claims against GE. There is no permissible bifurcation of harm caused by GE's misrepresentations from the workplace injuries falling under the Act’s broad coverage. The legal precedent firmly directs that such claims for occupational diseases and subsequent employer misrepresentations fall solely within the remedy construct of the Workers’ Compensation framework.

American Tobacco Co., 926 F.2d 1217, 1224 (1st Cir.1990). This maxim is especially applicable here where a ruling in plaintiffs’ favor would carve out a judicial exception without precedent to the exclusive remedial provision of the Workers’ Compensation Act. See Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc., 30 F.3d 255, 263 (1st Cir.1994) (absent extreme circumstances federal courts are bound by the constructions placed upon state statutes by state courts).
