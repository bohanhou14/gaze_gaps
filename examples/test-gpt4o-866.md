As established in the precedent of the Supreme Court’s opinion in case 407 U.S. 1, the remoteness of a forum might at times carry greater weight in determining the reasonableness of a forum clause if the chosen forum is seriously inconvenient for the trial of the action. However, when parties enter into a freely negotiated agreement, considerations of convenience should be seen in the context of what was contemplated at the time of contract formation. Here, the forum selection clause in the contract between Alpa and ACLI, designating New York as the forum, must be respected because both parties had contemplated and consented to this potential inconvenience during their negotiations.

Additionally, in National Equipment Rental Ltd. v. George E. Reagin, 338 F.2d 759, it was held that forum selection clauses within contracts must be upheld unless there is conclusive evidence to demonstrate that enforcing the clause would be unreasonable or violate public policy. The district court’s construction in that case was deemed overly restricted, underscoring that contractual designations of service of process must be respected unless significantly contrary to fairness and justice considerations.

Thus, the forum selection clause strongly supports the denial of the forum non conveniens motion as enforcement would not be unreasonable under the principles established in these reference cases, 407 U.S. 1 and 338 F.2d 759.
