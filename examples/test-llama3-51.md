The cases referenced in the writeup, 424 U.S. 319 and 452 U.S. 18, are crucial in understanding the context of Robinson's appeal. In Eldridge v. Ashcroft, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), the Supreme Court held that indigent parents do not have a constitutional right to appointed counsel in termination proceedings. However, in Tennessee v. Lane, 452 U.S. 18 (1981), the Court found that indigent parents do have a constitutional right to appointed counsel in termination proceedings.

In Robinson's case, the issue is whether he has a right to an attorney in a § 3582(c)(2) proceeding. The government argues that he does not have a constitutional right to an attorney, citing Eldridge. However, considering the complexities involved in the sentencing process, I believe that it is in the interest of justice to appoint Robinson an attorney.

Robinson's appeal raises several issues, including the application of the 100:1 ratio, the impact of Booker on the sentencing process, and the district court's discretion in crafting a new sentence. With an attorney, Robinson would be better equipped to argue his case and ensure that his rights are protected. I therefore grant Robinson's request for an attorney and recommend that counsel be appointed under the circuit procedure.
