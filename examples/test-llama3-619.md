In conclusion, the petition for review is denied. The petitioner, Bikram Singh, has not established a well-founded fear of future persecution. The agency's findings that the petitioner's home country, India, has undergone significant changes, and that he could safely relocate within the country, are supported by substantial evidence.

The petitioner's claim for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture is also denied. The agency's conclusions are supported by substantial evidence, and the petitioner has not shown that it is more likely than not that he would be subject to persecution or torture if returned to India.

The petitioner's argument that the agency's decision is based on a mischaracterization of the country, China, is without merit. The agency's opinion as a whole makes it clear that the correct country, India, was considered in the decision.

Finally, the petitioner's claim for humanitarian asylum is denied. The petitioner's past persecution was not so outrageous that a compelled return to India would be a cruelty. The agency's findings are supported by substantial evidence, and the petitioner has not shown that he would face harm or persecution if returned to India.

gold_text: As we have said many times before, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture are more limited remedies than asylum. See, e.g., Hao Zhu v. Gonzales, 465 F.3d 316, 322 (7th Cir.2006); Ahmed v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 611, 619 (7th Cir.2003). Therefore, a party who does not qualify for asylum necessarily does not qualify for these remedies either. See, e.g., Mekhtiev v. Holder, 559 F.3d 725, 731 (7th Cir.2009); Dandan, 339 F.3d at 575 n. 7. Because we have upheld the BIAâ€™s decision to deny asylum, Singh is also not entitled to these other forms of relief.
