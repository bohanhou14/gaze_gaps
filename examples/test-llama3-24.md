The case at hand involves a search of a convenience store, OC Store, and a vehicle, 1997 Chevy Blazer, by BIA Officer Shane Spargur. Officer Spargur entered the store without a warrant, claiming the store was open based on the presence of music, lights, and unlocked doors. Long, the operator of the store, claims that Officer Spargur's entry was unconstitutional.

According to Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128 (1978), a person must demonstrate a close connection to the place searched and a reasonable expectation of privacy to assert Fourth Amendment rights. Long failed to provide evidence that the store was closed, and the fact that the store was open to the public during normal business hours means that Officer Spargur's entry was reasonable.

Regarding the post-warrant search of the store, Long claims that Officer Spargur failed to read the warrant to Judge Miner, the telephonic judge, and that the warrant was not recorded. However, Officer Spargur read the application and "the meat" of the affidavit to Judge Miner, and Judge Miner testified that she would have questioned Officer Spargur if the information provided was not sufficient. This satisfies the requirements of United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984), and the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies.

The search of the Blazer was not challenged, and the government argues that Long's consent is irrelevant because he did not have standing to challenge the search. United States v. Gomez, 16 F.3d 254 (1994), holds that a defendant must demonstrate a close connection to the place or object searched to have standing. Long did not have standing to challenge the search of the Blazer.

In conclusion, Officer Spargur's entry into the OC Store was reasonable, and the post-warrant search of the store was valid under the good-faith exception. The search of the Blazer was not challenged, and Long did not have standing to challenge it. Therefore, the denial of Long's motion to suppress evidence is affirmed. Reference cases: 379 F.3d 524, 739 F.3d 391, 605 F.3d 604.

gold_text: Long also challenges the officers’ search of the Blazer parked in the OC Store’s public parking lot. “Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights that may not be asserted vicariously.” United States v. Barragan, 379 F.3d 524, 529 (8th Cir.2004). “To mount a successful motion to suppress, an accused must first establish that he personally has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the object that was searched.” United States v. Stringer, 739 F.3d 391, 396 (8th Cir.2014). Long admits he did not own the Blazer, and Long has provided no evidence suggesting he had any constitutionally protected connection to the vehicle or its contents. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 605 F.3d 604, 609 (8th Cir.2010) (deciding a defendant who “neither owned nor drove the [searched vehicle] and was only an occasional passenger therein” could not challenge the search of the vehicle). Long thus has shown no reasonable expectation of privacy in the Blazer and cannot now contest the search of the vehicle. See id.
