In assessing plaintiffs' request for modification, it's pertinent to note the high burden required for such changes, as modifications demand exceptional circumstances (United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 1932). The notion of unforeseen changes (United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 1968) determining modification necessity has not significantly altered since the decree's approval. Further, plaintiffs’ argument regarding the potential cessation of the GNMA Tandem program does not present a radical shift from the conditions evident during the decree’s negotiation. The standard to modify, as iterated in cases like Philadelphia Welfare Rights Organization v. Shapp (602 F.2d 1114, 1979), requires weighing equity hardships; however, plaintiffs have not firmly shown a shift of such magnitude to warrant immediate court intervention, as stressed in McGoff v. Rapone (78 F.R.D. 8, 24, E.D.Penn.1978).

Additionally, precedent such as Mayberry v. Maroney (558 F.2d 1159, 1977) reiterates that maintaining the essence of the original decree is crucial. Any new requirement must be balanced against justified expectations of the parties, and without a clear indication of substantial change, modification seems unmerited.

Given these considerations, plaintiffs' motion for modification is appropriately denied. The decree stands as negotiated, consistent with past judicial standards and without adequate justification for alteration.
