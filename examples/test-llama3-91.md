In the case of Hicks v. United States, the defendant sought to have his guilty plea invalidated on several grounds related to problems with his counsel and the proceedings surrounding his plea and sentencing. The court held that two of his allegations were meritless and two others were better suited for collateral proceedings.

The defendant claimed that the district court had improperly participated in plea negotiations, but the court found that the district court's comments were not coercive and did not amount to judicial pressure to plead guilty. The court also rejected the defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, finding that there was no evidence of counsel's failure to perform his duties.

In reaching its decision, the court cited two reference cases: Leahy v. United States (473 F.3d 401) and United States v. Mala (7 F.3d 1058). The court noted that ineffective assistance of counsel claims must be presented first to the trial court for factual development, and that direct review of conflict of interest claims is only appropriate where there is specific, colorable evidence of actual misconduct.

In conclusion, the court's decision was based on a thorough examination of the record and a careful consideration of the defendant's allegations. The court's findings on the defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and judicial coercion were consistent with the principles established in the referenced cases.

gold_text: ‘“We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.’ ” United States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401, 410 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993)). Hicks may choose to pursue his allegations that his counsel was conflicted and ineffective in a collateral proceeding. Regardless, on direct review, there is not enough to support his claims. The district court neither abused its discretion in denying counsel’s motion to withdraw, nor improperly participated in plea negotiations. Affirmed.
