In reviewing the BIA’s denial of Askari’s motion to reopen, it is necessary to apply the standard set forth in previous cases where such motions are assessed primarily on whether a prima facie case has been presented for reopening. As noted in reference case 485 U.S. 94, a motion to reopen is to be granted if the evidence supports the desired findings unless contradicted or overruled by other evidence, and inferences should be drawn in favor of the petitioner (See Maroufi v. INS, 772 F. 2d 599). 

Furthermore, the BIA is required to consider all relevant factors, including any property or business ties, as per reference case 20 F.3d 580. The failure to appropriately weigh evidence showing a change in circumstances or additional equities can be grounds for a remand or reversal. Tipu’s ownership of a taxicab, for instance, was a decisive factor demonstrating significant ties to the United States (See Sotto v. INS).

In Askari's case, her motion to reopen was supported by a State Department publication and new evidence of her political activities in the U.S. since the IJ’s decision. However, the BIA found that her evidence was either previously available or did not materially change her eligibility for asylum.

Based on these precedents, the BIA’s denial of Askari’s motion to reopen must be scrutinized to ensure all favorable inferences and new evidence were adequately considered. Given the established abuse of discretion review for such denials, unless the BIA's decision clearly shows no reasonable basis for the petitioner’s fear of persecution, the denial must stand. See 485 U.S. 94 for analogous principles and 20 F.3d 580 for the necessity of considering significant new equities.
