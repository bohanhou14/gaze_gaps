The plaintiff further underscores that commercial success alone should not establish patentability. In Williams Mfg. Co. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 316 U.S. 364, 367 (cited in 321 U.S. 275), it was emphasized that merely replacing a known element with another known element performing the same function does not constitute invention. Additionally, in such cases, the Supreme Court often refrains from overturning concurrent findings of two courts unless the case is exceptionally compelling, which this case is not (321 U.S. 275).

Moreover, the defendant's device operates identically to the plaintiff's patented device, echoing the principles and operations observed in both the patent and competitor's iterations. This parallels the analysis in cases like 275 U.S. 319 and 48 S. Ct. 170, where marginal differences in components did not substantiate a qualitatively different invention. The substitution of a radius link or torsional spring did not change the essential function or result, an analogy relevant to the practical substitution of saran filament in Cameron's design.

Furthermore, the claim that the Cameron cleaning pad was anticipated by prior art, such as in the Chain Store Age publication, bolsters the argument. As noted in 116 F.2d 63, a device's prior successful commercial use and its visible disclosure play a significant role in invalidating claims of original invention when it mirrors older art.

Thus, the Court concurs with the District Court's conclusion that the Cameron patent did not involve an inventive step but rather the application of established principles using an alternate material, resulting in no patentable invention.
