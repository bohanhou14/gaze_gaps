The principles from previous case law are pertinent to this decision. In reference case 128 F.2d 889, the court held that an action for damages for fraud, where no benefits were retained by the defendants, was not barred if it was lately discovered, as long as decedent had actual knowledge sufficient to commence the Statute of Limitations on the alleged claim of fraud. This parallels our situation with the fraudulent conspiracy claim against National City Bank, raising factual matters that cannot be summarily adjudicated.

Similarly, reference case 139 F.2d 318 emphasizes the validity of dismissing a complaint on summary judgment grounds while considering the necessity for a bill of particulars under Rule 12(e) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. This guideline is pertinent to underscore the procedural adequacy of dismissing complaints and the lack of merit in technical objections when substantive claims of fraud are in question.

Finally, as per reference case 2 F.R.D. 236, the motion for summary judgment obligates the movant to show there is no issue as to any material fact with specific, uncontroverted evidence. Here, National City Bank's motion under Rule 56 hinges on the argument of res judicata and limitation statutes, yet substantive issues of alleged fraud that could not be dismissed summarily were evidenced in the affidavits, indicating factual disputes suitable for trial rather than summary disposition.

Therefore, based on these precedents, the third and fourth counts assert plausible claims shielded from summary dismissal due to unresolved factual disputes necessitating trial scrutiny.

gold_text: Clearly there are issues with respect to the allegations of the complaint. The only other road for judgment for defendant is by way of the statute of limitations. To prevail upon that issue it must appear that discovery of the facts constituting the alleged fraud occurred more than six years before the commencement of the action. Upon the trial the burden of showing when the facts constituting the fraud were discovered is upon the plaintiff. Shultz v. Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co., D.C.,W.D.N.Y.1941, 40 F.Supp. 675, 686, affirmed 2 Cir., 128 F.2d 889, certiorari denied 317 U.S. 674, 63 S.Ct. 79, 87 L.Ed. 541; Mason v. Henry, 1897, 152 N.Y. 529, 539, 46 N.E. 837. But â€œon a motion for a summary judgment the burden of establishing the nonexistence of any genuine issue of fact is upon the moving party, all doubts are resolved against him, * * *." Walling v. Fairmont Creamery Co., 8 Cir., 1943, 139 F.2d 318, 322; Standard Rolling Mills, Inc., v. National Mineral Co., D.C.E.D.N.Y.1942, 2 F.R.D. 236, 237. This burden the defendant has not sustained.
