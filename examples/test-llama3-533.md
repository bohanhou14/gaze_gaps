In the case of 556 F.2d 822, the court determined that the EPA's action in promulgating a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for dioxin in the Columbia River Basin was not subject to review in the court of appeals. The court held that the TMDL was an "effluent limitation" within the meaning of 33 U.S.C. § 1369(b)(1)(E), and was therefore excluded from review by the court of appeals.

In the case of 538 F.2d 513, the court similarly held that the EPA's action in promulgating a TMDL for dioxin in the Columbia River Basin was not subject to review in the court of appeals. The court held that the TMDL was an "effluent limitation" within the meaning of 33 U.S.C. § 1369(b)(1)(E), and was therefore excluded from review by the court of appeals.

In conclusion, the court's decision in 556 F.2d 822 and 538 F.2d 513 is consistent with the statutory language of 33 U.S.C. § 1369(b)(1)(E), which excludes effluent limitations from review by the court of appeals. The TMDL in this case is an "effluent limitation" within the meaning of the statute, and is therefore not subject to review by the court of appeals.

We are persuaded that congress and the president decided to leave section 1313 out of the list of statutes in section 1369 for direct appeal from the EPA to the Court of Appeals. Our confidence in this construction is bolstered by the Second Circuit decision, which, though on a distinguishable rationale, reaches the same conclusion. Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Environmental Protection Agency, 538 F.2d 513, 518 (2d Cir.1976); see David Currie, Judicial Review Under Federal Pollution Laws, 62 Iowa L.Rev. 1221, 1244 (1977). Our decision is consistent with that of the Seventh Circuit, that EPA determinations under section 1313(d)(2) “are reviewable in an action in the district court under the judicial review provisions of the APA.” United States Steel Corp. v. Train, 556 F.2d 822, 836 (7th Cir.1977) (emphasis added).
