Based on the foregoing, the court must also consider cases involving fiduciary duties in bankruptcy proceedings. In "Guerra v. Fernandez-Rocha," the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the bankruptcy court's decision on the dischargeability of a debt arising from professional negligence (451 F.3d 813). The court held that a fiduciary capacity must pre-exist the transaction leading to the debt and requires specific trust-type obligations (451 F.3d 813). Similarly, in "First Union v. Telfair," the court addressed the issue of fiduciary duties related to unauthorized transactions and debt obligations (216 F.3d 1333). The trustee relationship and fiduciary responsibilities need to be explicitly established beforehand to be actionable under ยง 523(a)(4) (216 F.3d 1333).

Applying these precedents, the debtor's role as an investment advisor and manager over the plaintiff's discretionary account firmly establishes the fiduciary relationship necessary to determine nondischargeability of the debt under ยง 523(a)(4). The principles outlined in these cases, particularly the requirement for a pre-existing fiduciary relationship and recognized professional obligations, support the finding that the debtor's conduct involved willful or reckless neglect of fiduciary duties, constituting defalcation.

Therefore, following the detailed analysis and the precedents set forth in 451 F.3d 813 and 216 F.3d 1333, the court concludes that the plaintiff has sufficiently established the debtor's fiduciary role and breach thereof, rendering the $78,000 debt nondischargeable under ยง 523(a)(4).
