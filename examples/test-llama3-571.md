In the case of Kropinski v. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the court allowed the plaintiff to present evidence that the defendants' system of meditation, known as transcendental meditation (TM), constituted a system of "thought reform" that changed the practitioners' world view. The plaintiff alleged that he was induced to study and practice TM, which he believed would bring him personal and societal benefits, but instead resulted in financial, physical, and emotional harm.

The defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The court denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff's claim of fraud was timely because he had been misled by the defendants' representations and could not have reasonably discovered the fraud earlier.

The court also allowed the plaintiff to present expert testimony on thought reform, which was defined as "a method used by the Koreans to change the belief systems of prisoners of war." The plaintiff alleged that the defendants used thought reform to change his beliefs and promote a dependency on TM.

The jury awarded the plaintiff damages for the fraud and negligence claims, and the court entered judgment on the verdict. The defendants appealed, arguing that the court erred in denying their motion for summary judgment and allowing the plaintiff's expert testimony on thought reform.

In the case of United States v. Kubrick, the Supreme Court held that when a tort action against the government charges malpractice, the statutory limitations begin to run "when the plaintiff knows both the existence and the cause of his injury." In this case, the plaintiff alleged that he did not discover the fraud until 1983, well within the three-year statute of limitations.

In the case of Asuncion v. Columbia Hospital for Women, the court reaffirmed that there can be no recovery for negligently caused emotional distress, mental disturbance, or any consequences thereof, where there has been no accompanying physical injury. The plaintiff in this case alleged that he suffered psychological injuries as a result of practicing TM, but the court found that the evidence did not establish a causal relationship between the TM and the psychological injuries.

In summary, the court in Kropinski v. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi allowed the plaintiff to present evidence of thought reform and denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff's claim of fraud was timely. The court also allowed the plaintiff to present expert testimony on thought reform and awarded damages for the fraud and negligence claims. The defendants appealed, arguing that the court erred

gold_text: When one person defrauds another, there will be a delay between the time the fraud is perpetrated and the time the victim awakens to the fact. Accordingly, in a fraud case, the statute of limitations will not begin running until the date the fraud is discovered, or reasonably should have been. King v. Kitchen Magic, Inc., 391 A.2d 1184, 1186 (D.C.1978); see Richards v. Mileski, 662 F.2d 65, 71 (D.C.Cir.1981) (due diligence test applied to reasonableness of claimantâ€™s efforts to uncover existence of a claim). In some cases, most notably medical treatment cases, the running of the statute is tolled beyond the discovery date if the tortfeasor reassures the victim that the negative effects should be expected as part of the treatment, and if a reasonable person would believe such reassurances. See Page v. United States, 729 F.2d 818, 823 & n. 36 (D.C.Cir.1984).
