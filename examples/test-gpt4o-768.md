In determining the validity of Tennessee’s disenfranchisement law, we must consider precedents that explicitly uphold the state’s right to disenfranchise felons. In Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24, the Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of felon disenfranchisement under section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Similarly, the court in Owens v. Barnes, 711 F.2d 25, concluded that states may lawfully deny the voting rights of felons.

The plaintiffs argue the Tennessee Act violates the Equal Protection Clause due to its disproportionate impact on black citizens. However, a similar argument was dismissed in Green v. Board of Elections of City of New York, 380 F.2d 445, where the court noted the legitimate rationale behind felon disenfranchisement—to exclude those who have breached societal laws from participating in the electoral process.

Furthermore, the comparison to Hidalgo County’s reenfranchisement scheme for probationers in Texas, as discussed in 575 F.2d 1110, reveals that federal equal protection claims require substantial evidence of discriminatory purpose or effect. None were sufficiently established in this case.

Given the precedent and lack of compelling evidence for discriminatory intent or result, we affirm the district court’s decision that the Tennessee Act does not violate the Voting Rights Act, Fourteenth Amendment, or Fifteenth Amendment. Thus, the prior ruling is hereby AFFIRMED.
