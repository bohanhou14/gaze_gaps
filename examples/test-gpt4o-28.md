The defendant argues that the plaintiff, as an experienced worker, should have anticipated the risks associated with his employment and taken necessary precautions. However, established precedents elucidate that an employee is not mandated to discover extraordinary dangers imposed by employer negligence. As cited in Erie R. Co. v. Healy, 269 F. 1, and further supported by C. & O. Ry. Co. v. De Atley, 241 U.S. 310, 315 (36 S. Ct. 564), an employee is entitled to presume that adequate safety measures have been implemented by the employer, except in scenarios where extraordinary dangers are markedly apparent. The evidence underscored by the testimonies, particularly regarding the train operating without a headlight in poor visibility conditions, supports a jury finding of extraordinary danger that the plaintiff could not have reasonably anticipated.

In alignment with prior judgments like Gila Valley Ry. Co. v. Hall and Seaboard Air Line v. Horton, (ubi supra, 60 L. Ed. 1016), the rule remains that employees should not bear the burden of discovering hazards caused by employer negligence, nor assume risks unless blatantly obvious. Thus, the jury's verdict, which surmised negligence on part of the defendant due to lack of precautionary measures in a smoke-filled tunnel, stands on firm legal grounds.

Given the context and substantiation of hazards not inherently assumed in the employee’s work duties, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude negligence on the defendant's part, thereby justifying the judgment awarded to the plaintiff. The court did not err in its decisions aligned with these precedents, nor in rejecting defense requests for specific jury instructions that failed to encapsulate these rulings accurately.

gold_text: In Smith v. Payne (C. C. A.) 269 F. 1, 3, the court said: “But in order to safeguard himself from the ordinary 'dangers of his employment, as the law requires him to do, a traek employee is not called upon to seek out and discover extraordinary dangers imposed on him by his employer, but may assume that his employer and his agents have exercised for his safety such care as the circumstances reasonably admit” — the court adding in Ches. & Ohio Ry. v. De Atley, 241 U. S. 310, 36 S. Ct. 564, 566, 60 L. Ed. 1016: “Unless the want of care and the danger arising from it are so obvious that an ordinarily careful person, under the circumstances, would observe and appreciate them.” “The federal Employers’ Liability Act places a coemployee’s negligence, when it is the ground of the action, in the same relation as that of the employer upon the matter of assumption of risk.” See Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Ward, 252 U. S. 18, 21, 22, 40 S. Ct. 275, 276, 64 L. Ed. 430.
