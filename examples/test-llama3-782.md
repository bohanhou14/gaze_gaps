In the case of Aunt Jemima Mills Company v. Rigney & Co. (247 F. 407), the court held that even if the goods manufactured by the parties were different, the use of the same trade-mark could still be considered an infringement. The trade-mark in question was "Aunt Jemima's," which was originated by the Davis Milling Company in 1899. The court found that Rigney & Co.'s use of the same trade-mark on their syrup was an infringement, even though the products were different, because the public might be confused as to the source of the goods.

In the case of Vogue Company v. Vitek (300 F. 509), the court held that the use of a trade-mark on a different type of product could still be considered an infringement if the public might be confused as to the source of the goods. The trade-mark in question was "V-8," which was originally used by the plaintiff on vegetable juice cocktails. The court found that the defendant's use of the same trade-mark on vitamin tablets was an infringement, even though the products were different, because the public might be confused as to the source of the goods.

In the case at hand, it is clear that the use of the trade-mark "V-8" on vitamin tablets by the defendant is an infringement, as it is likely to confuse the public as to the source of the goods. The defendant's use of the trade-mark is also likely to dilute the distinctiveness of the trade-mark, which is an important consideration in trade-mark law.

In conclusion, the use of a trade-mark on a different type of product can still be considered an infringement if the public might be confused as to the source of the goods. The cases of Aunt Jemima Mills Company v. Rigney & Co. and Vogue Company v. Vitek support this conclusion, and the case at hand is similarly factually distinguishable. Therefore, the court should find that the defendant's use of the trade-mark "V-8" on vitamin tablets is an infringement of the plaintiff's trade-mark rights.

gold_text: The protection which the law gives the owner of a trade-mark is not confined to the goods upon which it is, or has been, used by the owner of it but extends to products which would be reasonably thought by the buying public to come from the same source if sold under the same mark. Aunt Jemima Mills Co. v. Rigney & Co., 2 Cir., 247 F. 407, L.R.A. 1918C, 1039; Vogue Co. v. Thompson-Hudson Co., 6 Cir., 300 F. 509; Wall v. Rolls-Royce of America, Inc., 3 Cir., 4 F.2d 333. His mark is the brand by which his goods can be identified, and when it is used by another the reputation of his mark, and consequently his own business reputation, are placed to that extent beyond his control. Unless the use by that other is upon goods so unlike his own or in territory so far from that which he has exploited that it will not create confusion, it will be enjoined. Yale Electric Corp. v.
