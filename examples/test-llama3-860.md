The cases discussed in the reference articles involve legal disputes between parties. In the first case, reference 525 F.3d 822, Park Place sued Freddie Mac and National City for intentional interference with contract. The district court denied Park Place's request for discovery, citing lack of specificity in the request and failure to file timely motions to compel discovery or extend the discovery cutoff date. The court also found that Park Place failed to present admissible evidence that Freddie Mac influenced National City to terminate the contract. In this case, the court applied California law, specifically Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Bear Steams & Co., 50 Cal.3d 1118, 270 Cal.Rptr. 1, 791 P.2d 587, 589-90 (1990).

In the second case, reference 567 F.3d 554, the plaintiffs sued Bennett and others for negligence and state civil rights claims. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, finding that the plaintiffs failed to establish proximate causation between the defendants' statements and the plaintiff's suicide. The court cited Provenz v. Miller, 102 F.3d 1478, 1483 (9th Cir.1996), and held that the plaintiffs' claims were time-barred. The court also applied the doctrine of Eleventh Amendment immunity to bar the state civil rights claims.

The cases discussed in the reference articles demonstrate the importance of specificity and timeliness in discovery requests and the need to present admissible evidence to support claims. They also highlight the application of specific legal doctrines, such as intentional interference with contract and proximate causation, in determining the outcome of legal disputes.

gold_text: The district court erred in finding Moser’s claims against Triare time-barred. Because Moser did not sue Triare for defamation, his other tort claims do not merge into a defamation claim. A two-year statute of limitations applies to Mos-er’s timely claims against Triare. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 335.1, 339. However, the district court properly granted summary judgment for Triare. With respect to intentional interference with contract, Moser has failed to show that Triare took intentional acts to induce breach. Family Home & Fin. Ctr., Inc. v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 525 F.3d 822, 825 (9th Cir.2008). Additionally, Moser has not shown proximate causation. Allen v. Powell, 248 Cal.App.2d 502, 56 Cal.Rptr. 715, 718 (1967); Mayes v. Bryan, 139 Cal.App.4th 1075, 44 Cal.Rptr.3d 14, 25 (2006) (holding that a “substantial factor” creates a force that is in continuous and active operation up to the time of the harm). Nor can Moser show that the settlement agreement would have been performed, but for Triarc’s approval of the disclosure. Dryden v. Tri-Valley Growers, 65 Cal.App.3d 990, 135 Cal.Rptr. 720, 725 (1977). With respect to the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, Moser has not shown that Triare engaged in outrageous conduct. Corales v. Bennett, 567 F.3d 554, 571 (9th Cir.2009); Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 6 Cal.4th 965, 25 Cal.Rptr.2d 550, 574, 863 P.2d 795 (1993) (holding outrageous conduct exceeds all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community). Moser also has failed to show that he suffered severe emotional distress. Girard v. Ball, 125 Cal.App.3d 772, 178 Cal.Rptr. 406, 414 (1981) (holding severe emotional distress is of “such substantial quantity or enduring quality that no reasonable man in a civilized society should be expected to endure it”).
