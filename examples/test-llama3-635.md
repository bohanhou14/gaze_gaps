The court's decision to grant Choice's motion to compel production of documents and to deny the request for a continued 30(b)(6) deposition is based on the finding that Infineon NA has access and control over documents possessed by Infineon AG. This decision is supported by the testimony of Mr. Wilson, co-counsel for Choice, who stated that Infineon NA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infineon AG and that the two companies share databases dealing with various documents and records.

This finding is consistent with the court's analysis in Camden Iron & Metal v. Marubeni America, 138 F.R.D. 438 (1991), which held that a subsidiary corporation has access to and control over documents possessed by its parent corporation. Similarly, in Cooper v. 102 F.R.D. 918, the court found that a corporation has control over documents held by a sister corporation where the sister corporation has access to the documents in the ordinary course of business.

The court also noted that Infineon NA's objection to producing the documents on the basis that they are irrelevant is unpersuasive. The court found that the documents dealing with WMAC are relevant to the litigation, whereas the documents dealing with the PHY chip are irrelevant.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant Choice's motion to compel production of documents and to deny the request for a continued 30(b)(6) deposition is well-supported by the evidence and precedents. The court's finding that Infineon NA has access and control over documents possessed by Infineon AG is consistent with the courts' decisions in Camden Iron & Metal and Cooper.

gold_text: During oral argument, counsel for third-party Infineon NA cited Securities and Exchange Commission v. Credit Bancorp 194 F.R.D. 469 (S.D.N.Y.2000) for the proposition that it should not be required to produce documents on behalf of Infineon AG. The language relied upon by counsel for Infineon first appeared in Cooper v. British Aerospace 102 F.R.D. 918 (S.D.N.Y.1984), in which the court required an American corporation to produce documents on behalf of its British affiliate because it was “inconceivable that defendant would not have access to [the] documents and the ability to obtain them for its usual business.” Id., at 919-920 (S.D.N.Y.1984). The court in Cooper based its decision, in part, on the fact that the American corporation was the distributor and servicer of the British affiliate’s product in the United States.
