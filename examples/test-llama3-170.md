The case of United States v. Thurston, 358 F.3d 51, and United States v. Thurston, 456 F.3d 211, presents a unique scenario where the defendant, William Thurston, was convicted of conspiring to defraud the Medicare program of over $5 million. The district court departed from the sentencing guidelines and imposed a sentence of three months' imprisonment and 24 months' supervised release. The government appealed, arguing that the sentence was unreasonably lenient.

In the first appeal, the court concluded that the district court erred in granting the downward departure and remanded for resentencing. United States v. Thurston, 358 F.3d 51. The court noted that the guidelines permit departures based on good works only in exceptional cases, and the district court's conclusion that Thurston's good works were exceptional was not supported by the record. Id.

On remand, the district court again departed from the guidelines and imposed a sentence of three months' imprisonment and 24 months' supervised release. United States v. Thurston, 456 F.3d 211. The government again appealed, arguing that the sentence was unreasonably lenient. The court concluded that the sentence was substantively unreasonable and remanded for resentencing.

In the third appeal, the court was faced with the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Gall, 128 S.Ct. 586, which held that the sentencing guidelines are advisory and that the court should give deference to the district court's sentencing decision. Applying Gall, the court concluded that the district court's sentence was procedurally sound and substantively reasonable. The court noted that the sentence was supported by a sufficient justification and that the degree of variance was not so great as to warrant a remand for resentencing.

In conclusion, the case of United States v. Thurston presents a complex scenario where the defendant was convicted of a serious crime and was sentenced to a lenient sentence. The appeals court was faced with the challenge of balancing the need for general deterrence and the need to give deference to the district court's sentencing decision. Ultimately, the court concluded that the sentence was procedurally sound and substantively reasonable. <answer>
