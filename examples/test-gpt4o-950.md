E. Jurisdictional Constraints and Section 1983 Claims

The Court must address the jurisdictional constraints highlighted in the Government's opposition. It contends that based on the 1990 amendment to Title 4, section 76 of the Virgin Islands Code, the District Court lacks jurisdiction over civil matters such as claims for injunctive relief, as exclusive jurisdiction lies with the Territorial Court (994 F.2d 1027). However, this Court retains jurisdiction over § 1983 claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(3), which denote federal question jurisdiction and civil rights and elective franchise jurisdiction, respectively.

Additionally, the Government argues that the Territory of the Virgin Islands and its officers, when acting in their official capacities, are not "persons" liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (28 V.I. 345; 495 U.S. 182). Supreme Court rulings such as Ngiraingas v. Sanchez (495 U.S. 182) confirm that territories and their officials in official capacity are not "persons" under § 1983 for damages. Nevertheless, the distinction between suits for damages and those for injunctive relief is upheld in cases such as Hafer v. Melo, indicating that officials sued for prospective injunctive relief fall within the "persons" category under § 1983 (962 F.2d 1366).

F. Relief Beyond Jurisdictional Boundaries

Despite the Government's jurisdictional challenges, this Court finds grounds to proceed under the injunctive relief scope. Prospective relief aimed at halting constitutional violations, rooted in First Amendment protections, places this suit within the parameters permitting judicial intervention under § 1983.

In light of the above considerations and consistent with established precedents, plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief is justified and enforceable within this legal context. The injunctive relief aligns with safeguarding constitutional rights against perceived government overreach and unlawful dismissal based on political association. Consequently, plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is granted, and enforcement by reinstating the plaintiffs is mandated.

An appropriate order follows.

Farrelly, 28 V.I. 345, 994 F.2d 1027 (3d Cir.1993). In that case the Third Circuit stated that “neither the Territory of the Virgin Islands, nor its officers acting in their official capacities are ‘persons' under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” 28 V.I. at 361, 994 F.2d at 1030 (quoting Ngiraingas v. Sanchez, 495 U.S. 182, 192, 110 S.Ct. 1737, 1743, 109 L.Ed.2d 163 (1990)). The government apparently neglected to read the footnote to this section of the Third Circuit's opinion which makes clear its inapplicability to the case at bar. In Brow, as in Ngiraingas, the courts were dealing with the question of retrospective monetary relief. Footnote 12 of the Brow decision makes clear that the Third Circuit did not intend to bar suits under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for prospective injunctive relief against officials of the Territory acting in their official capacity. This Court agrees with the holding of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Guam Soc. of Obstetricians & Gynecologists v. Ada, 962 F.2d 1366 (9th Cir.1992). There, the court held that a result such as that urged by the Assistant Attorney General in the case at bar
