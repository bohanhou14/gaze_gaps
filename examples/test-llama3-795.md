In the case of a 10-year-old's birthday party, the Arnold Firm served P & C with a copy of its Rule 11 motion on June 8, 2011, which is considered late service and deprived P & C of the safe-harbor period's protection. According to Ridder v. City of Springfield, 109 F.3d 288 (6th Cir. 1997), a party cannot wait until after summary judgment to move for sanctions under Rule 11. Similarly, in Nisenbaum v. Milwaukee County, 333 F.3d 804, 808 (7th Cir. 2003), the court held that the warning-shot requirement is not met by informal service, but rather requires formal service of a motion.

In this case, PNC Bank failed to comply with the warning-shot/safe-harbor requirement of Rule 11(c)(2) by serving two settlement offers with Rule 11 threats to Riffner, which is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement. The district court's conclusion that PNC Bank's two settlement offers with Rule 11 threats to Riffner were sufficient warning shots under Rule 11(c)(2) is misguided and does not comply with the plain language of the rule. As stated in Penn, LLC v. Prosper Business Dev. Corp., 773 F.3d 764, 768 (6th Cir. 2014), a party cannot delay serving its Rule 11 motion until conclusion of the case.

The court should have granted the motion for sanctions and imposed sanctions on NITEL and Riffner for violating Rule 11. The court's decision to impose sanctions on PNC Bank for failing to comply with the warning-shot/safe-harbor requirement of Rule 11(c)(2) is upheld. As stated in 524 F.3d 580, substantial compliance with the warning-shot requirement is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement.

gold_text: There are both legal and factual problems with this theory- of “substantial compliance” to save the sanctions order in this case. The legal problem is that the substantial compliance theory we adopted in Nisenbaum stands alone and is difficult to reconcile with the explicit requirements of the Rule and the clear explanation from the Advisory Committee. No other circuit has adopted this approach. See Penn, LLC v. Prosper Business Dev. Corp., 773 F.3d 764, 767-68 (6th Cir. 2014) (reviewing circuit split; Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have rejected “substantial compliance,” and only Seventh .Circuit has adopted it). Our colleagues in other circuits have been highly critical of the terse treatment of the issue in Nisenbaum. E.g., Cadle Co. v. Pratt (In re Pratt), 524 F.3d 580, 587-88 (5th Cir. 2008) CNisenbaum did not address language of Rule 11, Advisory Committee notes, or other Rule 11 jurisprudence); Roth v. Green, 466 F.3d 1179, 1193 (10th Cir. 2006) (same). As the Ninth Circuit explained in Barber v. Miller, “warnings were not motions” and “the Rule requires service of a motion.” 146 F.3d 707, 710 (9th Cir. 1998). The 1993 amendment “deliberately imposed” the requirement of service. Id. “It would therefore wrench both the language and purpose of the amendment to the Rule to permit an informal warning to substitute for service of a motion.” Id.
