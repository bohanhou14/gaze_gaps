The store further argues that the regulation discriminates against retailers by imposing harsher penalties compared to other professionals involved in federal programs, raising equal protection concerns. However, regulations do not constitute an absolute ban on classifications unless they involve a "suspect classification" or a "fundamental right" (Reference case 526 F.2d 319). In this instance, no such suspect classification or fundamental right is implicated.

Moreover, the store challenges the regulation’s constitutionality under the Tenth Amendment, asserting that it infringes upon state power. Nonetheless, federal funds with conditions such as licensing of nursing home administrators have been upheld as constitutional in the context of federal-state cooperation (Reference case 526 F.2d 319).

Regarding the clarity and applicability of the rule, the regulation’s explicit language diminishes any ambiguity, thus reinforcing the appropriateness of imposing penalties even where no direct deception is involved (Reference case 411 U.S. 356). The rule does not demand the same strict interpretation reserved for criminal statutes carrying more severe penalties.

Finally, the store’s claim that the sanction lacks clear and convincing evidence is unavailing. In instances where narcotics or food stamp fraud is involved, the evidence presented often suffices to uphold harsher penalties (Reference case 766 F.2d 190).

In conclusion, the district court’s grant of summary judgment and the permanent disqualification are reaffirmed, as the regulation aligns with statutory mandates and constitutional provisions.

gold_text: In a single sentence in its brief, the store also contends that the regulation deprives it of the equal protection of the laws. Because this contention is only stated as a conclusion and is not briefed at all we need not address it. United States v. Volksen, 766 F.2d 190, 193 (5th Cir.1985). We are not pointed to any circumstance which would indicate that the regulation fails to be rationally related to the statute or that there has been discriminatory application. See Mourning v.
