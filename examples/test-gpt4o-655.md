The defendants, citing *United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co.*, 98 U.S. 569, 604 and *Robertson v. Labor Board*, 268 U.S. 619, 622, assert that their business activities in Montana did not violate the Clayton Act, as their operations were consistent within the bounds of lawful commerce (273 U.S. 359). Further, their motion to dismiss relied on the argument that the statute of limitations expired, referencing *Chattanooga Foundry & Pipe Works v. City of Atlanta*, 203 U.S. 390 as controlling precedent, which dictates the application of local statutes of limitation (234 U.S. 579). Thus, applying the two-year statute under Montana law, the defendants maintain that any alleged anti-trust violations occurring before the statutory period must be dismissed. Evidence and testimonies were insufficient to demonstrate a sustained violation of the anti-trust statutes beyond the prescribed timeframe, confirming that the defense of the statute of limitations is valid and should be upheld.

gold_text: As a matter of fact, within the meaning of the Clayton Act, the-Illinois corporation was transacting business in the State of Montana during all the period complained of and up to the filing of the complaint herein. Though the West Virginia corporation operated the branch houses, they were, as I have stated, nevertheless subject to the supervision of division managers employed by the Illinois corporation; the Illinois corporation employed car route salesmen who solicited business in certain areas in the eastern part of Montana throughout the period complained of and as late as the middle of 1934. These salesmen were empowered not only to solicit orders but to execute contracts of sale. It was not necessary for them to obtain the confirmation of such sales by any officer or official of the home office. In addition they made collections of payments due from the customers of the Illinois corporation with whom they were doing business. Such activities clearly constituted business transacted within the State of Montana, Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Co., 273 U.S. 359, 47 S.Ct. 400, 71 L.Ed. 684. During the entire period it was entirely possible, under the provisions of the Clayton Act, to bring suit not only in the judicial district of which it was an inhabitant but also in any district where it could have been found or transacted business, and all process in such cases may be served in the district of which the corporation is an inhabitant or wherever it may be found.
