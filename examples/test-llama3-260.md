In the context of the legal cases, it is essential to consider the rights of prisoners and the role of prison officials in ensuring those rights are protected. Reference case 393 U.S. 483, Johnson v. Avery, 1968, highlights the importance of providing alternatives to mutual assistance among inmates. The court held that Tennessee's restriction on mutual assistance among inmates did not deprive prisoners of their constitutional right to access the writ of habeas corpus.

In reference case 460 F.2d 765, Younger v. Gilmore, 1971, the court emphasized that prisoner access to the courts is not to be curtailed or restricted by threats, intimidation, coercion, or punishment. This ruling underscores the significance of protecting prisoners' ability to seek legal redress.

Regarding the case at hand, I agree with the court's conclusion that the allegations in the complaint state a cause of action under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(3) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The court correctly held that the mere deprivation of property is not actionable under § 1983, citing cases such as Urbano v. Calissi, 384 F.2d 909 (3d Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 391 U.S. 925, 88 S.Ct. 1824, 20 L.Ed.2d 664 (1968).

However, the court's decision in Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972), explicitly rejected the distinction between personal liberties and proprietary rights, which was previously followed in cases such as Eisen v. Eastman, 421 F.2d 560 (2d Cir. 1969). This ruling supports the court's conclusion that the prisoner's allegations of deprivation of property state a cause of action under § 1983.

In conclusion, the court's decision is consistent with the principles outlined in the reference cases, particularly Johnson v. Avery and Younger v. Gilmore. The court correctly held that the allegations in the complaint state a cause of action under § 1983 and that the prisoner's right to access the courts is protected.

gold_text: The prisoner’s right of access to the courts was firmly established in Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969). It has subsequently been interpreted to mean that the state may not hinder a prisoner in his preparation of legal papers, . or impede his correspondence with courts, lawyers, or even law book publishers.Prison officials may not confiscate an inmate’s lawbooks, and may not impose any sanction for engaging in legal activities on his own behalf or for the benefit of fellow inmates. See generally, Corby v. Conboy, 457 F.2d 261 (2d Cir. 1972); Campbell v. Beto, 460 F.2d 765 (5th Cir. 1972). It has been recognized, furthermore, that the right of unimpeded access to courts implies a similar right of access to legal assistance. In Wells v. McGinnis, 344 F.Supp. 594 (S.D.N.Y.1972), Judge Gurfein held that a prisoner’s contention that the prison was interfering with his correspondence with his lawyer was sufficient to state a cause of action under § 1983. He deemed this contention a “serious charge”, and noted that “channels of communication between a prisoner and his counsel must be kept open.” I agree with this observation, and find it equally applicable to the allegations plaintiff has made here. Plaintiff has not been guilty of such conduct as to cause the revocation of his privileges, and I can find no reason why a phone call to his lawyer should not have been permitted. Since such calls are apparently permitted generally, no extraordinary procedures need have been invoked nor any disciplinary schemes disrupted. Under these circumstances, the refusal to allow communication with a lawyer would be violative of the Sixth Amendment if plaintiff can prove this refusal at trial.
