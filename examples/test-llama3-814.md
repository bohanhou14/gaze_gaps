In the case of a prisoner seeking damages for inadequate medical care, the court must consider whether the defendant official acted with deliberate indifference to the prisoner's serious medical needs. In this case, Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Adler failed to timely refill his prescription, resulting in five days of acid reflux symptoms. However, Plaintiff does not allege that Dr. Adler acted with reckless disregard for his safety, nor does he claim that Dr. Adler was aware of a substantial risk of harm to his health.

In the reference case of 511 U.S. 825, the court held that a prisoner must show that a prison official acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in order to establish a claim under the Eighth Amendment. The court also noted that mere negligence or medical malpractice is not sufficient to establish a claim of deliberate indifference.

Similarly, in the reference case of 111 F.3d 1364, the court held that a prisoner must show that a prison official acted with reckless disregard for his safety in order to establish a claim under the Eighth Amendment.

In this case, Plaintiff's allegations do not rise to the level of deliberate indifference or reckless disregard. While Plaintiff's acid reflux symptoms may have been serious, there is no evidence that Dr. Adler was aware of a substantial risk of harm to his health or that he acted with reckless disregard for his safety. Therefore, the court grants Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.

In conclusion, the court finds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for deliberate indifference or reckless disregard against Dr. Adler. The court grants Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and dismisses the case.

gold_text: In his Opposition to Defendants’ Motion, Plaintiff cites three cases. (See Opp. at unnumbered 3.) However, none of these cases suggests a different result, and two of the cases actually support Defendants’ Motion. First, Plaintiff cites Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), in which the Supreme Court outlined the prevailing legal standard for the deliberate indifference analysis. See id. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970 (deliberate indifference requires that a prison official must “know[] of and disregard^ an excessive risk to inmate health or safety” and “must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and ... must also draw the inference”). However, the Court has applied the Farmer standard for deliberate indifference in this case, and because the plaintiff in Farmer did not allege inadequate medical care, the case is not otherwise relevant. Plaintiff cites two other cases in which the plaintiffs claimed inadequate medical care, but in both of those eases, the courts dismissed the claims after finding that the plaintiffs did not satisfy the subjective prong. See Gutierrez v. Peters, 111 F.3d 1364, 1374 (7th Cir.1997) (dismissing a claim where the prison doctor’s incorrect diagnosis resulted in a two-week delay in treatment, but plaintiff was “promptly and comprehensively treated” once the mistake was corrected); Crayton v. Quarterman, No. 08-CV68, 2009 WL 3740650, at *4 (N.D.Tex. Nov. 6, 2009) (dismissing claim where prison officials allegedly exacerbated plaintiffs injuries by ignoring his medical condition, but plaintiff ultimately received “prompt and appropriate attention”). Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants’ Motion To Dismiss Plaintiffs § 1983 claims without prejudice.
