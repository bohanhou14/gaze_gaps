In addressing the appellant’s challenges regarding multipliciousness, we draw guidance from the precedents set in United States v. Holt, 16 M.J. 393 (C.M.A. 1983) and United States v. Baker, 16 M.J. 397 (C.M.A. 1983). Specifically, in Holt, the ruling emphasized that testing for multipliciousness must adhere strictly to the language of the specifications without speculative inquiries into potential hypothetical scenarios. This criterion aligns with Baker, which allowed for a specification to embrace the elements of a lesser offense only if such elements are explicitly included within the factual allegations of the greater offense.

In this case, the appellant’s specifications do not demonstrate multiplicity concerns when evaluated against the Baker test. The possession and distribution of marijuana were clearly delineated as separate offenses, distinct from the communication of a threat. Consequently, the violations claimed under these specifications do not overlap nor "fairly embrace" the elements of another distinct offense per Baker’s second test. As no speculative reconstruction of charges is warranted or necessary (Holt at 16 M.J. 393), appellant’s multipliciousness argument fails to provide grounds for relief.

Additionally, considering the military judge's sentence which was far below the maximum allowed, and there being no prejudicial error in how the specifications were drafted or adjudicated, the findings and sentence should be upheld. The judicial process adhered to established legal standards, ensuring that appellant experienced due process without undue prejudice.

Therefore, we find no grounds for relief based on multipliciousness or speculative hypothetical alterations to the charges. The court’s decisions were well within legal precedents, and accordingly, uphold the findings and adjudged sentence.

gold_text: Appellant also contends the two specifications alleging possession and distribution of a like amount of marijuana are multiplicious for findings purposes. We disagree. In testing for multiplicity, we need not go beyond the language of the specifications. United States v. Glover, 16 M.J. 397 (C.M.A.1983); United States v. Holt, 16 M.J. 393 (C.M.A.1983). Since the language of the distribution specifications do not “fairly embrace” the specifications alleging possession, no relief as to findings is required.
