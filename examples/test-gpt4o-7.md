Looking at the present bill, it appears that the receiver is attempting to circumvent the established legal framework which explicitly requires actions to be brought in a certain manner. According to the reference cases 8 Wall. 498 and 19 L. Ed. 476, the receiver, as the statutory assignee, holds the proper authority to institute suits both at law and in equity, representing the association and creditors alike without needing to make either a party to the suit.

Furthermore, as highlighted in 38 S. Ct. 38 and 62 L. Ed. 185, the liability of each stockholder constitutes a separate controversy, reducing the necessity for equity jurisdiction. The courts have consistently held, as noted in 8 Wall. 505 and 179 F. 32, that the receiver must proceed through appropriate legal channels rather than seeking to enforce stock subscriptions in this manner.

Notably, in 23 L. Ed. 220, similar principles were applied, emphasizing the requirement of proceeding through statutory methods rather than ancillary suits. The court has repeatedly insisted on adherence to legal forms and prescribed remedies, making the dismissal of the current bill consistent with established precedents.

In summation, the dismissal aligns with the necessity to respect the statutory roles and jurisdictional boundaries, reinforcing that the proper course for the receiver is to petition within the existing receivership suit. This method ensures procedural compliance and equitable resolution without overstepping the bounds of legal practice.
