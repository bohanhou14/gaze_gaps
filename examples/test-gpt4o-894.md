In addressing the legal intricacies of this matter, reference must be made to the established principles in case law. In 252 F. 575, it was stressed that an offer and acceptance must be identical, highlighting that any discrepancy, such as in the terms of payment or delivery location, results in no meeting of minds, thus nullifying the agreement. Similarly, in 239 F. 631, the court delved into the reliance on customary practices and implicit agreements within commercial transactions. It was asserted that custom or practice possesses the force of law, and parties are presumed to contract with such usages in mind.

Applying these principles, it is evident that the dispute turns on whether the documents and actions align with customary and explicit terms of the agreement. Specifically, the discord in the bills of lading, and insurance terms must be seen through the lens of such established practices. The letter of credit and the required coverage, akin to the scenarios explored in 239 F. 631 regarding usage and customary practices, must thus be interpreted against this backdrop. Therefore, the core of the determination rests on whether the precise legal standards and customary interpretations, as established in the precedent cases, were satisfactorily met by the actions of both Pan-American and City Bank.

gold_text: It is doubtless true that, when the parties hereto agree, as they did in the United States, that certain documents were to be the test of a transaction (d. e., negotiation in Brazil), it was their intent that the documents should correspond and comply with Brazilian law and usage. Furthermore, the parties agreed with reference to a particular nexus of trades; i. e., the shipping and sugar trades. At this bar, Pan-American argues that it at least had the right to have a jury find that it was aware of any usage or custom to which the (e. g.) bills of lading might conform, or by which they might be validated. This is incorrect; Pan-American agreed that City Bank should do certain things, and that necessarily implied that the bank should act in accordance with such laws, customs, and usages as it encountered in the place or places where the promise was to be and was fulfilled.
