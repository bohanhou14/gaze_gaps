The case at hand involves a claim for reformation of a contract, which is logically related to the original claim regarding underpayment of contractual obligations. The claim for reformation arises from the same transaction as the original claim, and rests on the same basis of aggregate operative facts. As stated in Mascotte v. Florida Municipal Liability Self Insurers Program, 444 So.2d 965 (Fla.App.1983), pet rev. denied, 451 So.2d 847 (Fla.1984), a claim has a logical relationship to the original claim if it arises out of the same aggregate of operative facts, or if the aggregate core of facts upon which the original claim rests activates additional legal rights in a party defendant that would otherwise remain dormant.

In this case, the claim for reformation is logically related to the original claim as it seeks to reform the contract to reflect the original intent of the parties. This is similar to the scenario in Neil v. South Florida Auto Painters, Inc., 397 So.2d 1160 (Fla.App.1981), where the court ruled that the acts out of which the plaintiff's claims arose were logically related to the garage's claim.

Furthermore, as stated in Republic Health v. Lifemark Hospitals of Florida, 755 F.2d 1453, 1454 (11th Cir.1985), whether failure to bring a compulsory counterclaim in a prior state court proceeding bars a diversity action on that claim in a federal district court, depends upon state law. Therefore, we agree with the District Court that the claim for reformation of the contract constitutes a compulsory counterclaim, and is thus barred from relitigation in federal court.

However, we disagree with the District Court's decision to bar Appellant Weigel as a successor in interest pendente lite. Weigel did not join in the original suit and did not have any obligation to do so. Therefore, he cannot be barred for failing to have done so.

In conclusion, we affirm the District Court's decision to bar the claim for reformation of the contract as a compulsory counterclaim, but remand the case to the District Court to determine whether lis pendens notice was given or actual knowledge existed regarding Weigel's purchase of the property pendente lite.

gold_text: Only claims that do not arise from common operative facts are not logically related. For example, where plaintiff bought a tractor and sued for unsatisfactory performance, a claim by the manufacturer-defendant for nonpayment of notes on other purchased equipment is not a compulsory counterclaim. Shavers v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc., 834 F.2d 970 (11th Cir.1987). See also Republic Health v. Lifemark Hospitals, 755 F.2d 1453 (11th Cir.1985) (in suit focused on the narrow issue of the legal right to purchase, a new complaint that is wide-ranging, alleging antitrust violations, is not a compulsory counterclaim).
