**Generation:**

The present appeal requires us to address several facets of trademark law, particularly as they pertain to usage rights and injunctive relief. The precedents established in comparable cases provide guidance on this matter. In Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 461 F.2d 1040 (2nd Cir. 1972), the court highlighted the importance of establishing whether the use of a contested term (in that case, "Safari") constituted an infringement or merely described a class of product. Similar principles of descriptiveness and generic use are integral to our examination of the "Wrist Rocket" trademark in this case.

Additionally, in the case cited as 233 F.2d 180, the court underscored the necessity of distinctiveness and non-confusability in claims of unfair competition and trademark infringement. Here too, our determination rests on whether deceptive trade practices or unfair competition arose from the concurrent use of "Wrist Rocket" by both parties.

The District Court, while appropriately recognizing Saunders' common law rights based on priority of use and public association, erred in canceling Ellenburg's registration due to his incontestable status under 15 U.S.C. § 1065. This discrepancy aligns with the principle laid out in 233 F.2d 180, highlighting distinct bases for infringement and unfair competition claims.

Accordingly, we affirm the District Court's findings regarding liability and damages but reverse the order canceling Ellenburg’s registration. Furthermore, to mitigate consumer confusion, we mandate distinct, prominent prefixes indicating the source of the "Wrist Rocket" products. This decision synthesizes the equitable considerations outlined in the aforementioned cases and ensures compliance with statutory protections.
