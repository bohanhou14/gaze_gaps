In the context of bankruptcy, the determination of whether an obligation represents alimony or a property settlement is crucial. The parties' characterization of the transaction on their tax returns is merely evidence of their intent regarding the transaction, and does not act to estop the party from taking a subsequently different position. As stated in Kritt v. Kritt (In re Kritt), 190 B.R. 382 (9th Cir. BAP 1995), "the parties' characterization of the transaction on their tax returns is merely evidence of their intent regarding the transaction, and does not act to estop the party from taking a subsequently different position." The court should examine the substance, rather than the form, of the transaction to determine the true nature of the award.

In the case of a divorce settlement, the court should consider the factors outlined in Goin v. Rives (In re Goin), 808 F.2d 1391, 1392-93 (10th Cir.1987), such as whether the agreement fails to provide explicitly for spousal support, whether there are minor children and an imbalance of income, whether the payments are made directly to the recipient and are paid in installments over a substantial period of time, and whether the obligation terminates on remarriage or death. The court should also consider the treatment of the monthly payments as alimony for tax purposes, as in Davidson v. Davidson (In re Davidson), 947 F.2d 1294, 1297 (5th Cir.1991), where the court held that the claiming of a payment as alimony on a tax return estops a party from ever taking a contrary position.

In conclusion, the determination of whether an obligation represents alimony or a property settlement is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of the factors outlined above. The court should examine the substance, rather than the form, of the transaction to determine the true nature of the award, and should consider the treatment of the monthly payments as alimony for tax purposes. By considering these factors, the court can make a more informed decision about whether the obligation is dischargeable or not.

gold_text: Kritt v. Kritt (In re Kritt), 190 B.R. 382, 388-389 (9th Cir. BAP 1995) (citations and footnote omitted) (hereafter “Kritt”). The Kritt analysis has met with wide acceptance. See Sillins v. Sillins (In re Sillins), 264 B.R. 894, 898 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 2001); Horner v. Horner (In re Horner), 222 B.R. 918, 923 n. 5 (S.D.Ga.1998); Kelley v. Kelley (In re Kelley), 216 B.R. 806, 809-10 (Bankr.E.D.Tenn.1998). This Court, after a thorough review of the case law, finds the analysis in Kritt to be the most compelling and in line with the statements contained in Sampson, and thus holds that the treatment of a payment as alimony for income tax purposes is but one factor to be considered by a bankruptcy court in making its determination under § 523(a)(5).
