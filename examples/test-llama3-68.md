Based on the provided reference cases, it appears that Chase Manhattan Mortgage did not violate the automatic stay by collecting the Corderos' debts from a third party. The court in Kapila v. Atlantic Mortgage & Investment Corp., 184 F.3d 1335, 1337 (11th Cir.1999), held that the owner of a mortgage interest may transfer its interest after the mortgagor files for bankruptcy, and that the perfected mortgage is neither actually nor potentially the property of the debtor.

In the present case, Chase transferred the Corderos' mortgage and declared the mortgage in default, but did not take any action to collect the debt from the Corderos themselves. According to State of California v. Taxel, 98 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1996), the automatic stay provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 362 have been violated if a creditor takes action to collect a pre-petition debt from the debtor or from a third party. However, there is no evidence in this record to suggest that Chase took any action to collect the debt from the Corderos or from a third party.

Furthermore, the court in Nishimatsu Const. Co., Ltd. v. Houston Nat. Bank, 515 F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir.1976), held that a default judgment is unassailable on the merits but only so far as it is supported by well-pleaded allegations, assumed to be true. In this case, the Corderos' allegations do not support a finding that Chase violated the automatic stay.

In conclusion, based on the reference cases, Chase Manhattan Mortgage did not violate the automatic stay by collecting the Corderos' debts from a third party. The court's default judgment for sanctions against Chase is therefore vacated.

gold_text: After a thorough review of the case law, I cannot find any basis for finding a violation of the automatic stay on the record before me. Chase did not violate the stay by transferring the Corderos’ mortgage after the bankruptcy filing. See In re Cook, 457 F.3d 561, 568 (6th Cir.2006) (citing Kapila v. Atlantic Mortgage & Investment Corp., 184 F.3d 1335, 1337 (11th Cir.1999)). Chase did not violate the stay by communicating a default to the FHA, where the purpose of the communication was simply to obtain repayment from a third-party guarantor. Cf. In re Colon, 212 B.R. 23, 25 (Bkrtcy.D.Puerto Rico 1997) (failure of a higher education corporation to remove a default notation from debtor’s record upon the filing of a bankruptcy or the confirmation of the plan “was a communication that the debtor had an uncured default” and did not violate the automatic stay). And Chase did not violate the stay by collecting from a third-party “guarantor” of the Corderos’ mortgage debt. See Lynch v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 710 F.2d 1194, 1196-97 (6th Cir.1983) (“[i]t is universally acknowledged that an automatic stay of proceedings accorded by § 362 may not be invoked by entities such as sureties, guarantors, co-obligors, or others with a similar legal or factual nexus to the ... debtor”); In re Smith, 14 B.R. 956, 957 (Bkrtcy.D.Conn.1981) (student loan creditor did not violate automatic stay by putting guarantor on notice of the plaintiffs default and requesting payment from guarantor in accordance with their loan guarantee agreement). In sum, the Corderos have not submitted any case law, and I have not found any either, in which a creditor was sanctioned for violating the automatic stay under the circumstances present in this case. I do not doubt that Chase’s actions made it more difficult (or impossible) for the Corderos to obtain a second guaranty from the FHA, or that Chase could have improved the Corderos’ prospects for reorganization by declining to make a claim against the mortgage insurance policy. Anytime a creditor, such as Chase, seeks repayment from a third party surety or guarantor, such as the FHA, the third party is less likely to guaranty the debtor’s future debts. But the fact that the debtor can no longer obtain a guaranty from that third party, is no fault of the collecting creditor, and cannot be held a sanctionable interference with the debtor’s property. As explained by the Fourth Circuit in Credit Alliance Corp. v. Williams, 851 F.2d 119, 121-22 (4th Cir.1988), a primary rationale for refusing to extend the automatic stay to nonbankrupt third parties is to insure that creditors obtain “the protection they sought and received when they required a third party to guaranty the debt.”
