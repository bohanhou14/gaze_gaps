The case at hand involves a dispute between Liberto and Stauffer over the use of a trademarked design on animal crackers. The parties had previously executed a settlement agreement in 1998, which was later entered as a final judgment in 1999. The agreement granted Stauffer an exclusive license to use Liberto's trademark on its animal crackers, with the specific terms of the license to be agreed upon later.

However, the settlement agreement did not specify the duration of the license, the grounds for its renewal or termination, or the manner in which the licensed mark would be used. The parties also failed to agree on the terms of the license, leading to a dispute over the effective date of the royalty payments.

In the 2002 litigation, Liberto sought payment of royalties under the settlement agreement, but Stauffer argued that the agreement was an "agreement to agree" and not a binding contract. The district court held that the settlement agreement was enforceable as a contract and granted injunctive relief to Liberto.

On appeal, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court's decision, holding that the settlement agreement was an "agreement to agree" and not a binding contract. The court found that the agreement did not specify essential terms, such as the duration of the license or the grounds for its renewal or termination, and that the parties did not intend to create a binding contract.

The court also rejected Liberto's argument that Stauffer had ratified the settlement agreement by making an initial royalty payment in 1999. The court held that Stauffer's payment was not a ratification of the agreement, but rather a non-binding promise.

The court further held that the district court abused its discretion in issuing an injunction, as the settlement agreement did not provide a clear basis for an adjudication of trademark infringement.

In conclusion, the Fifth Circuit's decision in this case highlights the importance of specifying essential terms in a contract and the need for mutual agreement on the terms of a license. The court's holding that the settlement agreement was an "agreement to agree" and not a binding contract underscores the need for parties to carefully consider the terms of their agreements and to negotiate in good faith.
