Here is my writeup based on the provided reference cases:

The concept of knowing and voluntary guilty plea is a crucial aspect of a fair trial. In the case of Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U.S. 637, the Supreme Court emphasized that a defendant's plea must be both knowing and voluntary. In this case, the trial court read the sexual assault statute to the defendant, the attorney for the state read the elements of the offense in open court, and the defendant acknowledged that his counsel advised him of the nature of the charge against him. Although the attorney for the state neglected to mention the mens rea element of the statute, the defendant's plea was still knowing and voluntary.

The defendant's argument that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because the trial court failed to inform him of all the elements of the sexual assault charge is unfounded. In Sober v. Crist, 644 F.2d 807, the Ninth Circuit held that the record need not necessarily show that every element of the crime was explained in detail to the defendant, but it will normally show an explanation of the charge by the judge or a representation by counsel that he explained it.

Furthermore, the defendant's argument that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because the trial court failed to inform him of all the penalties associated with his guilty plea is also unfounded. In Butcher v. United States, 926 F.2d 811, the Ninth Circuit held that the trial court's failure to inform a defendant of the penalties associated with his guilty plea did not render the plea involuntary.

In conclusion, the defendant's plea was both knowing and voluntary, and the trial court did not err in accepting his guilty plea. The defendant's arguments are unfounded, and the case law supports the trial court's decision.

gold_text: A plea is not voluntary “unless the defendant received ‘real notice of the true nature of the charge against him....’” Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U.S. 637, 644, 96 S.Ct. 2253, 2257, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976) (quoting Smith v. O’Grady, 312 U.S. 329, 334, 61 S.Ct. 572, 574, 85 L.Ed. 859 (1941)). Notice “does not require a description of every element of the offense.” United States v. Butcher, 926 F.2d 811, 816 (9th Cir.1991). In fact, “it may be appropriate to presume that in most cases defense counsel routinely explain the nature of the offense in sufficient detail to give the accused notice of what he is being asked to admit.” Henderson, 426 U.S. at 647, 96 S.Ct. at 2258, 49 L.Ed.2d 108. Where “intent is such a critical element” of the offense charged, however, a court should give the accused notice that the state must prove that element. Id. at 647 n. 18, 96 S.Ct. at 2258 n. 18, 49 L.Ed.2d 108.
