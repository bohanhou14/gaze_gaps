In similar circumstances, courts have deemed technical defects in service insufficient for dismissal provided no actual prejudice is demonstrated. For instance, technical defaults in summons service were not deemed grounds for dismissal absent prejudice to the party. As observed in United Food & Commercial Workers Union, Locals 197 v. Alpha Beta Co., 736 F.2d 1371, 1382 (9th Cir.1984), Rule 4 is a flexible rule construed to uphold service as long as notice is sufficient. Accordingly, the court found that procedural objections did not warrant dismissal.

Moreover, in Klein v. Discoverer Reederei, courts emphasized that technical defects must show actual prejudice to justify a motion to dismiss (39 F.3d 1398). Similarly, in this case, RMN has not demonstrated actual prejudice due to service by "C. Smith." Hence, I conclude that RMN's procedural objections do not justify a dismissal of the complaint under Rule 12(b)(5).

Given the lack of prejudice and RMN's conduct leading Plaintiff to believe no such defense would be raised, their motion to dismiss for improper service is denied, aligning with the principles highlighted in the aforementioned cases.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed, RMN's Motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process is denied.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

gold_text: I also note that the deficiency of process is merely technical. Though C. Smith was not authorized to accept service, knowledge that RMN was to be a defendant in this action was clearly passed on to the appropriate persons at RMN because RMN retained counsel with respect to this complaint. “Rule 4 [providing for service of process] is a flexible rule that should be liberally construed so long as a party receives sufficient notice of the complaint.” United Food & Commercial Workers Union v. Alpha Beta Co., 736 F.2d 1371, 1382 (9th Cir.1984). Additionally, technical defects “do not justify dismissal unless a party is able to demonstrate actual prejudice.” Chan v. Society Expeditions, Inc., 39 F.3d 1398, 1404 (9th Cir.1994). Here, RMN clearly received sufficient notice of the complaint to enable it to take actions necessary to defend itself and it has not demonstrated any prejudice. As such, I deem service of process to have been effective.
