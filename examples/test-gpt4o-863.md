The provisions of the Bill of Lading contracts in the present case distinctly stipulate that the consignor is not liable for the freight charges once the shipments are delivered to the consignee without prepayment, especially considering the non-recourse clause signed by the consignor. This is consistent with the judicial precedent set in Illinois Steel Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 320 U.S. 508, wherein the non-recourse provision in the Bill of Lading was upheld over the prepayment clause (320 U.S. 508 at p. 511). 

Furthermore, the contractual obligation to pay freight charges, as inferred from the Bill of Lading, places primary liability on the party from whom the goods are received unless clearly rebutted by stipulations within the contract (Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Central Iron & Coal Co., 265 U.S. 59 at p. 67). Here, the Defendant-consignor explicitly relieved itself of liability through the non-recourse clause, and Plaintiff's failure to enforce the Listâ€™s prepayment requirement supports the enforceability of the Bill of Lading's non-recourse provision.

Thus, based on the precedents in 320 U.S. 508 and 265 U.S. 59, interpreting the Bill of Lading as a contract that exonerates the consignor from liability when delivery is made without prepayment, this Court concludes that the Defendant is not liable for the freight charges under the established terms and Federal law governing interstate shipments.
