CF Industries, Inc. and CF Industries Sales, L.L.C. (collectively, CFI) are suing the Department of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) for denying their request for evidence related to the West Fertilizer facility fire and explosion. CFI claims that ATF's denial of their request is improper and is seeking a declaratory judgment and an order compelling ATF to produce the requested evidence.

In reviewing ATF's decision, we must consider the applicable Touhy regulations, which prohibit disclosures that would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes and would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques and procedures. ATF has provided CFI with a significant amount of information, abandoning its prior blanket denial of CFI's Touhy requests. We must assess ATF's decision as an agency action reviewed under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

In Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156 (1963), the Supreme Court held that an agency's action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself. Similarly, in Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 465 U.S. 29 (1984), the Court held that a court may not impose additional procedural requirements upon an agency. In this case, ATF's denial of CFI's request is based on its consideration of the relevant data and articulation of a satisfactory explanation for its action.

We decline to apply the framework urged by CFI to this APA action. Rather, we assess ATF's decision as an agency action reviewed under the APA. The record reflects that ATF recognized and considered the applicable Touhy regulations in making its decision. Therefore, we conclude that ATF's decision to withhold certain evidence because disclosure would harm or otherwise interfere with law enforcement efforts was not irrational, arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. We affirm the judgment of the district court.
