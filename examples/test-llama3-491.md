ORDER AND JUDGMENT

The court reviews a district court's decision to grant summary judgment de novo, using the same legal standard applicable in the district court. Summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. In making this determination, the court views all evidence and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.

Ms. Benton alleged that she was terminated by Mr. LeFebvre on July 22, 2004, for exercising her right to free speech on three occasions. However, the district court granted summary judgment as to the first two claimed incidents of protected speech on the grounds that there was no evidence that Mr. LeFebvre had any knowledge that Ms. Benton had spoken to anyone regarding the alleged threat to a tax payer. Ms. Benton does not appeal these determinations.

Instead, she argues that the district court erred in regard to its ruling on her claim that her firing was in retaliation for her refusal to speak to the General Assembly. The district court noted that it appeared that Ms. Benton refused to testify sometime in February 2004, approximately five months before her position was terminated. The court held that with that five-month lapse, the termination was not so close in time to her refusal to testify that a reasonable fact-finder could infer that the failure to testify played a substantial part in the decision to fire her without other evidence.

In determining whether a public employer impermissibly retaliated against a public employee in violation of her First Amendment rights, this court applies the four-part test derived from Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563 (1968) and Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983). The first two steps of this analysis are questions of law to be resolved by the court, while the third and fourth steps are questions of fact for the jury.

As to what evidence would suffice in regard to a plaintiff's burden at step three, this court held in Maestas v. Segura, 416 F.3d 1182 (10th Cir. 2005) that evidence of causation may include evidence the employer expressed opposition to the employee's speech, or evidence

gold_text: Ms. Benton’s final point of error argues that the district court erred because its grant of summary judgment “was based on arguments that Defendants never made.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 13. Generally, a district court cannot grant summary judgment to a defendant on an issue not presented in the defendant’s motion for summary judgment without notice to the plaintiff. Graham v. City of Okla. City, 859 F.2d 142, 145 (10th Cir.1988). But, “[i]f a losing party was not prejudiced by the lack of notice, we will not reverse simply because the grant of summary judgment came sua sponte.” Ward v. Utah, 398 F.3d 1239, 1245-46 (10th Cir. 2005). In her brief, Ms. Benton claims that “[t]he district court’s grant of summary judgment [was] based on factual arguments that Defendants did not make, and which Plaintiff had no notice were at issue.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 13.
