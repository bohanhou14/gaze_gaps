In the case of 239 F. 631, the court held that the result of the paper writings in evidence was not that Pan-American guaranteed anything; rather, it undertook and promised to pay City Bank whatever it lawfully paid, plus one-eighth of 1 per cent. This is in line with the holding in Border Bank v. American Bank (C. C. A.) 282 F. 73, that a promise by a corporation to reimburse a bank for payments made by the latter on a letter of credit is not a guaranty.

In the case of 252 F. 575, the court held that the essential nature of the transaction between Pan-American and City Bank was that Pan-American had given Seago credit by means of asking City Bank to use its Brazilian branch to put the arrangement through. This is similar to the situation in Pan-American's letter to City Bank of May 25th, which stated that "We have opened for account of Seago & Co. a credit through you," meaning that Pan-American had given Seago credit by means of asking City Bank to use its Brazilian branch.

In both cases, the courts have held that the promises made by the parties were not guaranties, but rather promises to pay or reimburse. This is in line with the holding in Nowell v. Equitable, etc., Co., 249 Mass. 585, 144 N. E. 749, that a promise by a corporation to reimburse a bank for payments made by the latter on a letter of credit is not a guaranty.

In conclusion, the cases of 239 F. 631 and 252 F. 575 support the conclusion that the promise made by Pan-American to City Bank was not a guaranty, but rather a promise to pay or reimburse. This is consistent with the holdings in Border Bank v. American Bank and Nowell v. Equitable, etc., Co. The case of Vietor v. City Bank, 200 App. Div. 557, 193 N. Y. S. 868, is not applicable to the present case, as it deals with "received for shipment" bills of lading, whereas the present case involves "on board" bills of lading.

gold_text: It is doubtless true that, when the parties hereto agree, as they did in the United States, that certain documents were to be the test of a transaction (d. e., negotiation in Brazil), it was their intent that the documents should correspond and comply with Brazilian law and usage. Furthermore, the parties agreed with reference to a particular nexus of trades; i. e., the shipping and sugar trades. At this bar, Pan-American argues that it at least had the right to have a jury find that it was aware of any usage or custom to which the (e. g.) bills of lading might conform, or by which they might be validated. This is incorrect; Pan-American agreed that City Bank should do certain things, and that necessarily implied that the bank should act in accordance with such laws, customs, and usages as it encountered in the place or places where the promise was to be and was fulfilled.
