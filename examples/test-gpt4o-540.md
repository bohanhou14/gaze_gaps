The adequacy of the Miranda warning provided by Sergeant Hudson is crucial. In United States v. Noti, 731 F.2d 610, the court emphasized that defendants must be advised of their right to have counsel present during questioning. Here, Sergeant Hudson informed Colin-Velasquez of his right to an attorney prior to questioning but did not explicitly state the right to have an attorney during the questioning. This omission is significant as established in both Noti and United States v. Bland, 908 F.2d 471, which reiterated the "critical importance of the right to know that counsel may be present during questioning."

The case of California v. Prysock, 453 U.S. 355 suggests that no specific phraseology is required, yet it underscores that the essence of the Miranda rights, particularly the right to counsel during questioning, must be conveyed. Failure to articulate this right adequately renders the warning inadequate. In Bland, the court reversed the decision due to similar inadequacies in the Miranda warning.

Thus, considering the precedent set by these cases (731 F.2d 610, 908 F.2d 471, 630 F.2d 661), the Miranda warning provided to Colin-Velasquez was insufficient. Consequently, his statements post-Miranda warning must be suppressed, as the warnings failed to fully inform him of his rights, which is a violation of Miranda v. Arizona.

gold_text: The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that advisement of the right to have counsel present during questioning “is mandated by the Constitution.” United States v. Noti, 731 F.2d 610, 615 (9th Cir.1984); accord United States v. Bland, 908 F.2d 471, 474 (9th Cir.1990). Here, Sergeant Hudson first informed Colin-Velasquez that he had the right to have an attorney present prior to questioning. However, immediately thereafter, Sergeant Hudson presented Colin-Velasquez with a Miranda rights card in Spanish and asked him to read the card. After reading the card, Colin-Velasquez then acknowledged understanding his rights. Because Colin-Velasquez was provided with accurate Miranda warnings in his native language immediately after receiving the incomplete warnings, the court finds no violation of his constitutional rights. See United States v. Lopez-Diaz, 630 F.2d 661, 664 (9th Cir.1980) (“even though the second of the three warnings given to [the defendant] was inaccurate, he was adequately apprised of his Miranda rights”).
