The court finds that GMAC lacks standing to bring the Motion for Relief from Stay. The case does not demonstrate that GMAC is the holder of the Note, and the evidence shows that the special endorsement from GreenPoint to GMAC is not properly affixed to the Note. In reference to 367 B.R. 138, the court holds that an endorsement must be written by or on behalf of the holder and on the instrument or on a paper so firmly affixed thereto as to become a part thereof.

Furthermore, the MERS Assignment of the DOT did not provide GMAC with standing. MERS, as the beneficiary of the DOT, has no economic interest in the Note, and therefore, cannot satisfy the requirements of constitutional standing. Reference 374 B.R. 210 supports this holding, stating that an assignee steps into the shoes of the assignor and that the assignee's rights are subject to the infirmity of the obligor's right.

Additionally, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Note was sold to Lehman and became part of the Trust. The court finds that GMAC has failed to "connect the dots" to demonstrate that the Note and DOT were securitized.

In conclusion, GMAC lacks standing to bring the Motion for Relief from Stay, and the court hereby denies the Motion. The Debtor is hereby ordered to resume making payments as previously ordered.

No additional consideration is required, as opposed to a novation which creates a new obligation. Id. at 216-17 citing Restatement (Seoond) of Conteacts § 280, cmt. e. Therefore, the Debtor’s argument that the Note is unenforceable because the funder of the Note was not the payee fails. The Note is still valid and can be enforced by the party who has the right to enforce it under applicable Arizona law.
