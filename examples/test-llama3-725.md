ORDER RE OBJECTION TO TRUSTEE'S REPORT ON CLAIMS

This case involves an objection to the Trustee's Report on Claims filed by Sears, Roebuck & Co. (Sears) regarding a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case filed by Jonas and Jean Harnish (Debtors). The issue at hand is the value of Sears' lien and the effect of the confirmed plan on the lien.

The parties have stipulated that the value of the property purchased with Debtors' Searseharge, excluding the garage door openers, is $100.00. However, the garage door openers have been placed in customers' homes or businesses in the ordinary course of business, making them valueless. Therefore, the amount of Sears' lien is $100.00.

The Court finds that Sears participated in the bankruptcy by filing a proof of claim prior to the original date set for the confirmation hearing. Additionally, the confirmed plan provides for distribution to unsecured creditors, including Sears, whose claim is duly approved and allowed. Therefore, the plan deals with or provides for Sears' claim under ยง 1327(c).

The Court holds that the lien is extinguished by confirmation, citing In re Siemers, 205 B.R. 583, 586 (Bankr.D.Minn.1997), and In re Penroci, 50 F.3d 459, 463 (7th Cir.1995). The confirmed plan is silent regarding Sears' lien, and Sears did not object to the plan or file a proof of claim as an unsecured creditor. Therefore, Sears' lien is extinguished, and its entire claim is unsecured.

This Order is based on the following references: 58 F.3d 89, 172 B.R. 595, and In re Siemers, 205 B.R. 583, 586 (Bankr.D.Minn.1997).

gold_text: The Court is aware that cases in other courts have reached the opposite result. See Cen-Pen Corp. v. Hanson, 58 F.3d 89, 94 (4th Cir.1995) (stating that if Chapter 13 plan does not address a lien, it passes through the bankruptcy process intact); Kuebler v. United States, 172 B.R. 595, 596 (E.D.Ark.1994) (where debtor failed to object to secured claim and creditor failed to object to Chapter 13 plan, the lien remains enforceable in rem after completion of payments). While admittedly subject to debate, the decisions in Be-Mac and Harmon rendered by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals provide sufficient guidance to convince this Court that a hen not preserved in a Chapter 13 plan is extinguished at confirmation, if the creditor has filed a proof of a secured claim and is scheduled as an unsecured creditor.
