In the case of Darwin Constr. Co. v. United States, the court considered whether the Board's decision to uphold the termination for default was correct. The court held that the Board's decision was arbitrary and capricious, and that the contracting officer's decision to terminate the contract was not based on a good faith evaluation of the contractor's performance.

The court cited several cases in support of its decision, including Schlesinger v. United States, 390 F.2d 702, 182 Ct.Cl. 571 (1968), which held that the government's decision to terminate a contract must be based on a good faith evaluation of the contractor's performance, and not on a desire to rid itself of the contractor. The court also cited Kalvar Corp. v. United States, 543 F.2d 1298, 211 Ct.Cl. 192 (1976), which held that "well-nigh irrefragable proof" is required to show that a government official acted in bad faith.

The court also noted that the Board's decision was in conflict with several other cases, including Nuclear Research Associates, Inc. v. United States, 70-1 BCA Â¶ 8,237 (1970), which held that once the right of termination is acquired by the government, the Board will uphold the termination for default without any inquiry into the "motives" or judgment of the contracting officer leading to the decision to terminate.

In conclusion, the court held that the Board's decision to uphold the termination for default was arbitrary and capricious, and that the contracting officer's decision to terminate the contract was not based on a good faith evaluation of the contractor's performance. The court also noted that the Board's decision was in conflict with several other cases, including Schlesinger v. United States, Kalvar Corp. v. United States, and Nuclear Research Associates, Inc. v. United States. (Reference cases: 17 How. 344, 175 U.S. 588, 223 U.S. 695)

gold_text: In innumerable cases it has been held that where discretion is conferred on an administrative officer to render a decision, this decision must be honestly rendered, and that if it is arbitrary or capricious, or rendered in bad faith, the courts have power to review it and set it aside. This court has this question presented to it constantly in cases arising under Government contracts, where the contracting officer and the head of the department are given the power to render final decisions on questions of fact. Both this Court and the Supreme Court have many times held that if the decision is arbitrary or capricious or so grossly erroneous as to imply bad faith, it will be set aside. See, e.g. Burchell v. Marsh, 17 How. 344, 349, [15 L.Ed. 96], Kihlbert v. United States, 97 U.S. [Otto] 398 [24 L.Ed. 1106]; United States v. Gleason, 175 U.S. 588, 602 [20 S.Ct. 228, 233, 44 L.Ed. 284]; Ripley v. United States, 223 U.S. 695, 701 [32 S.Ct. 352, 355, 56 L.Ed. 614].
