The issue at hand concerns the timeliness of a habeas corpus petition filed by Michael Neal, a prisoner currently confined at the Saginaw Correctional Facility in Freeland, Michigan. The petition was filed with the Court on September 20, 1999, challenging his conviction on one count of first-degree murder and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.

In his petition, Neal argues that his conviction became final on January 16, 1991, and that he had until April 24, 1997, to file a habeas corpus petition in federal court. However, Neal's conviction became final before the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) took effect, and accordingly, he was required to file his petition within one year of the AEDPA's effective date.

The Court notes that the AEDPA amended 28 U.S.C. § 2244 to include a one-year limitation period within which habeas petitions challenging state court judgments must be filed. The limitation period begins to run on the date the judgment becomes final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.

In this case, the limitation period began to run on January 16, 1991, and Neal's petition was filed over eight years later. The Court finds that the petition is untimely and must be dismissed. In so holding, the Court relies on the reasoning of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Bronaugh v. Ohio, 235 F.3d 280 (6th Cir.2000), which held that habeas petitions filed after the one-year statute of limitations had expired were barred as untimely.

The Court further notes that the AEDPA's one-year limitation period is not tolled by the filing of a state collateral review petition, as held in Smith v. McGinnis, 208 F.3d 13 (2d Cir.2000). The Court's decision is supported by the reasoning of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Isham v. Randle, 226 F.3d 691 (6th Cir.2000), which held that habeas petitions filed after the one-year statute of limitations had expired were barred as untimely.

In conclusion, the Court finds that the petition is untimely and must be dismissed.

gold_text: Nor may petitioner avoid the application of the statute of limitation under the doctrine of “equitable tolling.” “Equitable tolling stops the running of the statute of limitations in light of established equitable considerations.” New Castle County v. Halliburton NUS Corp., 111 F.3d 1116, 1125 (3d Cir.1997). At least one federal appellate court has concluded that the statute of limitations period set forth in § 2244(d) is subject to equitable tolling. Calderon v. United States District Court for the Central District of California, 128 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (9th Cir.1997). Equitable tolling under the AEDPA should be found, and an extension of time granted, only if “ ‘extraordinary circumstances’ beyond a prisoner’s control make it impossible to file a petition on time.” Moore v. Hawley, 7 F.Supp.2d 901, 904 (E.D.Mich.1998). In the present case, petitioner has not offered any reasons for failing to file his petition for writ of habeas corpus within the one year limitations period. Likewise, petitioner fails to offer any reasons for waiting over six years following the denial of his direct appeal by the Michigan Supreme Court to file his second motion for postconviction relief with the state courts or to seek habeas relief with the federal courts. A habeas petitioner must diligently pursue habeas relief to avail himself of the doctrine of equitable tolling. Craddock v. Mohr, 215 F.3d 1325, 2000 WL 658023, *2 (6th Cir. May 8, 2000). Because petitioner has not adequately explained his failure to diligently pursue post-conviction relief in the state courts or to seek a writ of habeas corpus with this Court, he is not entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period. See Jones v. Gundy, 100 F.Supp.2d 485, 488 (W.D.Mich.2000).
