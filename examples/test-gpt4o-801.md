As established in the precedent set by Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, a qualified First Amendment right of access applies to documents submitted in connection with a summary judgment motion. This means that, notwithstanding any protective order, documents that play a role in judicial adjudication are presumed accessible to the public. Similarly, "an adjudication is a formal act of government, the basis of which should, absent exceptional circumstances, be subject to public scrutiny," (Joy v. North, 692 F.2d 880).

Nonetheless, this presumption can be overcome if "countervailing factors" or "higher values" necessitate sealing, but such an order must be narrowly tailored and supported by specific findings (435 F.3d 110). In the present case, while the defendants argue for maintaining confidentiality under attorney-client privilege, this privilege was effectively waived when the documents were submitted by the plaintiffs as part of their summary judgment opposition (see Joy v. North, 692 F.2d 880).

As the Court has observed no specific, articulated harms from disclosure beyond broad and unsupported claims, and taking into consideration the overriding public interest in judicial transparency, the plaintiffs’ motion to unseal their summary judgment papers is granted. The limited redacted materials now satisfy the balance of interests, whereby the public’s right to access outweighs the unsupported claims of harm by the defendants.

gold_text: As was recently re-articulated in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.2006), “documents submitted to a court for its consideration in a summary judgment motion are—as a matter of law-—judicial documents to which a strong presumption of access attaches, under both the common law and the First Amendment.” Id. at 121. Lugosch notes that “summary judgment is an adjudication, and ‘[a]n adjudication is a formal act of government, the basis of which should, absent exceptional circumstances, be subject to public scrutiny.’ ” Id. (quoting Joy v. North, 692 F.2d 880, 893 (2d Cir.1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1051, 103 S.Ct. 1498, 75 L.Ed.2d 930 (1983) (brackets in original)). Thus, summary judgment documents “should not remain under seal absent the most compelling reasons.” Id.
