The case of Stuart v. Michelson presents a constitutional challenge to the University of Iowa's policy of charging nonresident students a higher tuition rate. The plaintiff, Michelson, argues that the policy is unconstitutional because it deprives him of his right to equal protection and due process. He claims that he is a resident of Iowa and should be classified as such, despite the university's decision to the contrary.

The court holds that the university's policy is constitutional, citing cases such as Vlandis v. Kline (412 U.S. 441) and Starns v. Malkerson (326 F.Supp. 234). The court notes that the policy is designed to protect the quality of the university's education and to ensure that only bona fide residents of Iowa receive the benefits of in-state tuition.

In regards to Michelson's claim that he is a resident of Iowa, the court holds that the university's decision to classify him as a nonresident was not arbitrary or capricious. The court notes that Michelson's actions, such as registering to vote in Johnson County and obtaining an Iowa driver's license, do not necessarily demonstrate his intent to make Iowa his permanent home.

The court also holds that Michelson's claims of procedural due process violation are without merit. The court notes that the university's review committee provided him with a constitutionally adequate statement of the reasons for its decision, and that the committee's procedures were designed to ensure that students have a meaningful opportunity to be heard.

As for Osmundson's claim, the court holds that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by not appealing the denial of his application for resident classification to the review committee. The court notes that Osmundson was aware of the roles of Mr. Duerksen and the review committee in the decision-making process, but failed to proceed far enough in the administrative process to present a case or controversy between him and the defendant university officials.

In conclusion, the court holds that the university's policy of charging nonresident students a higher tuition rate is constitutional, and that Michelson's claims of equal protection and due process violations are without merit. Osmundson's claim is also dismissed due to his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.

gold_text: It is not the function of this Court, as a Court of the United States, to become embroiled in the day-to-day administration of the University of Iowa’s nonresident fee program. The University has important financial interests in the program. It has promulgated rules and adopted a procedure for administering the program. Mr. Osmundson, by his own lack of actions, prevented the Review Committee from taking any action on his alleged application, and the Court does not know what the Committee’s decision would have been. The Court is asked in effect to decide whether a decision that was never made was arbitrary and capricious. The issue is a constitutional one and was not clearly presented to the Court on an unambiguous record. Under these circumstances, the Court would abstain from ruling on Mr. Osmundson’s claim even if a case or controversy existed. Cf. Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 814-16, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976); Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943). The Court sees no need to order a remand of Mr. Osmundson’s case to the Review Committee in view of the fact that he has the right under the Board of Regents’ rules to make a new application for resident classification during each semester or session he attends the University.
