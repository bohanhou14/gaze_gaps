In Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407, the Supreme Court clarified that in cases concerning lack of behavioral control, it is sufficient to demonstrate "serious difficulty in controlling behavior" without requiring absolute precision. This concept builds on the principles established in previous rulings, such as Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, which emphasized the dual requirements of mental illness and dangerousness for civil commitment.

The Petitioner, Richard S., contends that New York courts should have applied this standard alongside the established criteria of mental illness and dangerousness. However, the Third Department's findings, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, focused on these dual requirements without an explicit need for proving volitional impairment as outlined in Crane. The court found ample evidence supporting Richard S.'s continual mental illness and danger, satisfying the standards of New York law consistent with Supreme Court precedents.

Given that the Supreme Court's rulings in 521 U.S. 346 and 534 U.S. 407 provide for states to have considerable discretion in formulating criteria for civil commitment, the state courts' application of these principles to Richard S.’s case cannot be deemed an unreasonable application of federal law. Therefore, Petitioner’s argument that Crane mandates a proof of serious difficulty in behavioral control as a distinct element in his case does not hold, given the existing legal framework. Consequently, the habeas petition lacks merit under the AEDPA's standards.

Based on these considerations, it is recommended that the Petition be denied and dismissed.
