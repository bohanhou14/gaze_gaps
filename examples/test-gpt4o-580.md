This case draws significant parallels with several precedent cases underscoring the discretionary-function exemption. In *Reminga v. United States*, 631 F.2d 449, the court found negligence where the TV tower's ground location was inaccurately depicted on a chart. However, unlike *Reminga*, where the chart failed to reflect the actual conditions, the Wichita sectional chart conformed to IACC specifications, accurately depicting the essential details required.

Further, the discretionary function's scope as explained in *First National Bank v. United States*, 552 F.2d 370, encompasses determinations made in the planning and policy-making stages, including, as seen here, the development of aeronautical chart specifications. The IACC's decisions fall squarely within these protected areas.

Additionally, in the case of *Spillway Marina, Inc. v. United States*, 445 F.2d 876, it was established that actions falling under discretionary functions are shielded from liability under the FTCA, particularly when they involve policy decisions, such as flood control measures in that instance or chart design choices here.

Lastly, appellants' contention was also mirrored in *City and County of San Francisco v. United States*, 629 F.2d 581, where the misrepresentation exception barred claims based on failure to convey accurate information. Here, plaintiffs’ argument that additional detail should have been provided on the chart essentially seeks to impose liability for the IACC’s policy decisions, thus invoking the misrepresentation exception.

In conclusion, plaintiffs' claims against the Government for the publication of the Wichita sectional chart fall into the discretionary function category, thereby affirming the district court’s lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a).

gold_text: Simply put, plaintiffs challenge the Wichita sectional chart because it was too sketchy. This challenge thus goes to the heart of the IACC’s deliberative and judgmental activities in designing and approving the extent of detail to be included in aeronautical sectional charts versus the extent of detail left to be gleaned from other sources that the prudent pilot can be expected to consult. Such design and approval activities or choices by the Government fall within the discretionary-function exception and are not actionable under the Federal Tort Claims Act. See, e. g., Reminga v. United States, 631 F.2d 449, 454-56 (6th Cir. 1980) (activity in designing FAA regulations that do not require lighting or other warning markers on tower guy wires); Wright v. United States, 568 F.2d 153, 154 (10th Cir. 1977) (activity of Interior Department in designing approach roads to bridge), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 824, 99 S.Ct. 94, 58 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978); First National Bank v. United States, 552 F.2d 370, 376 (10th Cir. 1977) (activity of Agriculture Department in devising warning labels for pesticides and investigating dangers connected with prior use of such pesticides); Miller v. United States, 522 F.2d 386, 387 (6th Cir. 1975) (failure to adopt more strict air safety regulations); Spillway Marina, Inc. v. United States, 445 F.2d 876, 878 (10th Cir. 1971) (policy decision to lower reservoir’s water level created alleged need to give warnings; held Government’s omission within discretionary-function exception and not negligence at operational level). See also Payton v. United States, 636 F.2d 132,146-47 (5th Cir. 1981); Green v. United States, 629 F.2d 581, 585-86 (9th Cir. 1980). Contrary to the dissent, we believe that the IACC’s activities here are more analogous to those in cases like Reminga, Wright, First National, Miller, and Spillway, than to the operational activities in Indian Towing, Smith, Yates, or United Air Lines. We must therefore affirm the district court’s dismissal of plaintiffs’ claim.
