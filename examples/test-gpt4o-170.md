III.

In concluding our review of Thurston's sentence, it is critical to reflect upon the precedential context offered by prior determinations. In Thurston I, we found that the downward departure based on good works was not justified under the guidelines, as they permit such departures only in "exceptional" cases (358 F.3d 51, 78-79). The district court had erred in granting this departure by equating Thurston’s sentence with that of a co-defendant, Isola, which was highlighted as inappropriate (456 F.3d 211, 216).

Subsequent reevaluation in Thurston II confirmed this standpoint, establishing that the initial leniency undermined the gravity of Thurston’s offense and the deterrent objectives of sentencing (456 F.3d 211, 215-220). Despite the district court's consideration of Thurston's extensive community and charitable contributions, these factors alone could not substantiate the significant downward variance (358 F.3d 51, 79).

In light of Gall, the sentence’s procedural soundness remains reaffirmed but necessitates due deference to the district court’s broader discretion under § 3553(a). Here, the overall circumstances, particularly Thurston's acceptance of responsibility and his extraordinary charitable engagements, albeit debatable, ultimately align within Gall’s permissive framework for downward variances. Consequently, while cognizant of previous evaluations, we resolve that a remand would be ineffectual and affirm the district court’s imposition of a three-month incarceration and 24 months' supervised release.

So ordered.
