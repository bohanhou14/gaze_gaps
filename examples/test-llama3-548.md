OPINION
In these consolidated cases, Timothy McDonald and Deloris Glover appeal their convictions for carjacking and carrying firearms during a crime of violence. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.

The sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions was not challenged. Therefore, we review the admissibility of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Harris, 192 F.3d 580, 588 (6th Cir.1999). The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Agent Zimmer's testimony as an expert in the area of manufacture of vehicles and vehicle parts, as he was qualified to provide technical information to law enforcement agencies and officers. United States v. Langley, No. 93-5219, 1994 WL 518394 (4th Cir. September 23, 1994), reversed, 62 F.3d 602 (1995) (en banc).

Moreover, the court gave a cautionary instruction to the jury, warning them that they did not have to accept the expert's testimony. United States v. Morgan, 238 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir.2001). We believe that the admission of Agent Zimmer's testimony was proper and did not usurp the function of the jury. United States v. DeClue, 899 F.2d 1465, 1473 (6th Cir.1990).

Therefore, we reject Glover's contention that the admission of Agent Zimmer's testimony was prejudicial. United States v. Staples, - U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994); United States v. Hooker, 997 F.2d 67 (5th Cir.1993). The convictions are hereby AFFIRMED.

gold_text: Agent Zimmer’s testimony did not usurp the function of the jury; rather, his testimony was permissible as an expert opinion to help the jury determine a fact in issue. Cf. United States v. Monus, 128 F.3d 376, 386 (6th Cir.1997) (holding that expert testimony of IRS agent regarding tax liability did not usurp the function of the jury as agent did not give her opinion about the guilt of the defendant). Other courts have held that the government may use expert testimony to prove the interstate nexus element of a weapons charge brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 922. See, e.g., United States v. Corey, 207 F.3d 84, 88-89 (1st Cir.2000) (noting that an expert may testify that a weapon was manufactured in one state and sold in another, and thus to state their opinion as to that issue); United States v. Privett, 68 F.3d 101, 104 (5th Cir.1995) (holding that “[pjroof of the interstate nexus to the firearm may be based upon expert testimony”), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1226, 116 S.Ct. 1862, 134 L.Ed.2d 960 (1996); United States v. Dunn, 946 F.2d 615, 618 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that an expert may testify regarding the place of manufacture of a weapon in order to establish whether the weapon traveled in interstate commerce); United States v. Ware, 914 F.2d at 1002-03 (7th Cir.1990) (holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing expert to testify as to the place of manufacture of weapon, since his testimony could have been useful to the jury to determine whether the weapon had traveled in interstate commerce and court gave a limiting instruction). The reasoning of those courts is applicable here. The ultimate decision as to whether the victim’s car had traveled in interstate or foreign commerce remained within the province of the jury. The expert was only drawing on common sense when he gave his opinion as to the ultimate issue, and the jury was informed that it could accept or reject the expert’s testimony, as it could with any other witness.
