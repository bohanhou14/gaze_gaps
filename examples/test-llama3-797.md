In the case of Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation v. Bush (549 U.S. 422), the Supreme Court held that the government did not waive its sovereign immunity under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for damages caused by illegal wiretapping. The court found that there was no explicit waiver of sovereign immunity in the statute, and even if there was an implied waiver, it would be unclear.

In a similar vein, the court in United States v. Mitchell (636 F.3d 1190) held that a waiver of sovereign immunity cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed. The court noted that the government did not waive its sovereign immunity in the statute, and even if it did, it would be limited to the specific circumstances of the case.

In the case at hand, the court found that the claims against the government under FISA were insufficient to establish liability, and therefore, the government did not waive its sovereign immunity. The court also found that the claims against FBI Director Mueller in his individual capacity were insufficient to survive summary judgment.

In conclusion, the court held that the government did not waive its sovereign immunity under FISA for damages caused by illegal wiretapping, and the claims against the government and FBI Director Mueller were dismissed. The court's decision is consistent with the principles of sovereign immunity and the need for explicit waivers of immunity in statutes.
