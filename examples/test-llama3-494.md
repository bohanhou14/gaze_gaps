The cases presented demonstrate the complexities of legal issues and the importance of evaluating the facts and circumstances in each case. In Case 461 U.S. 95, the Court held that a plaintiff is not entitled to injunctive relief unless there is a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way. This principle is also applicable to the case at hand, where Blakeney seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants for their handling of his private criminal complaint.

In Case 343 U.S. 326, the Court emphasized the importance of examining the conduct of the defendants and determining whether it constitutes a continuing practice or a conspiracy violative of antitrust laws. The Court also cautioned against assuming that a defendant's actions have been abandoned without clear proof.

In Blakeney's case, the District Court correctly determined that the defendants were entitled to absolute immunity from suits for damages in the performance of judicial acts and actions related to the initiation and prosecution of a criminal matter. The Court also correctly determined that Blakeney's claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were barred by Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994).

Furthermore, the Court correctly determined that Blakeney's claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were not cognizable under section 1983, as he is not entitled to the relief he seeks. The Court also correctly determined that Blakeney's allegations regarding his allegedly unconstitutional criminal conviction have not yet accrued, and therefore, he cannot yet recover damages under section 1983.

In conclusion, the cases presented demonstrate the importance of evaluating the facts and circumstances in each case and the need to carefully consider the legal principles and precedents that apply. The District Court's decision in this case was correct, and Blakeney's appeal is without merit.

gold_text: Blakeney seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring the defendants to process his complaint “in accordance to law,” to allow him to amend and file motions for change of venue, and to appoint counsel, among other requests. Even if defendants violated Blakeney’s rights in the past as he alleges, he does not allege that he has any reason to believe that he might suffer such treatment in the future. His claim for injunctive relief is thus purely speculative and does not present a “case or controversy” under Article III. See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-110, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). Moreover, as the acts of which he complains were not ongoing at the time that he filed the complaint, the relief he seeks is not properly characterized as injunctive. See United States v. Or. State Med. Soc’y, 343 U.S. 326, 333, 72 S.Ct. 690, 96 L.Ed. 978 (1952).
