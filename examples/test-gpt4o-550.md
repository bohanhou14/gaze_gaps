VI.

In addressing the United States' argument that the plaintiffs' claims are time-barred by the statute of limitations, the court refers to the precedent set in Reference Case 207 F.2d 740. The court held that the statute of limitations did not run against plaintiffs who were not properly made parties to the action, affirming that the plaintiffs could seek relief under the Tucker Act despite the lapse of time. Similarly, in this matter, the claim that the statute of limitations bars the plaintiffs' action is inapplicable, as their interests will not vest until October 21, 1988. Under this interpretation, the plaintiffs' claims are timely.

VII.

Furthermore, the court turns to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to assess whether the 1936-1939 condemnation judgments can be set aside. Reference Case 672 F.2d 1044 elucidates that Rule 60(b)(6) has been applied liberally to grant relief where parties were inadequately represented or when equitable considerations demanded it. Given the circumstances where guardians ad litem failed to protect the interests of minor, incompetent, and unknown Bradley heirs, the plaintiffs' situation mirrors the exceptional and compelling circumstances necessary for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).

For these reasons, the court affirms the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability, with relief granted under Rule 60(b)(6) for the inadequately represented Bradley heirs.

AND IT IS SO ORDERED.

gold_text: . The United States contended in oral argument that the express language of Rule 60(b) forecloses relief to any heir who was unborn at the time of the condemnations because no unborn heir was "a party or his legal representative” to the original condemnation proceedings. This court recognizes that there is, as a general rule, merit to this argument, Screven v. U.S., 207 F.2d 740 (5th Cir.1953); however, under the circumstances of this case, the unborn heirs were sufficiently connected and identified with the original condemnation actions to attack those judgments. Dunlop v. Pan American Airways, Inc., 672 F.2d 1044 (2d Cir.1982). This case is especially suited for Rule 60(b) relief since, in addition to the then unborn Bradley heirs, the parties to the original condemnation judgments—(the United States, the then adult Bradley heirs, and the then minor, incompetent and unknown Bradley heirs)—are parties to this action. See Karnegis v. Schooler, 57 F.Supp. 178 (N.D.Tex.1944) (third parties not entitled to Rule 60 relief unless original parties who secured the decree are parties to new suit). In its supplemental brief filed after oral argument, the United States conceded that the unborn Bradley heirs were sufficiently connected and identified with the original condemnation proceedings to attack those judgments in this action.
