In determining whether the $25,000 contribution to the profit-sharing trust was properly accrued in 1953, we reference the decision in 27 T.C. 372. The court in that case concluded that contributions could be considered paid within the taxable year if made within the 60-day grace period, provided there is a valid trust res. Similar to the Crow-Burlingame Co. case (15 T.C. 738), the existence of a trust res is pivotal. Here, the petitioner issued a check in February 1954 and deposited it into the profit-sharing trust account by April 1954, satisfying the requirement that payment was made within 60 days post-1953.

Furthermore, as in 269 U.S. 422, the critical assessment is whether the trust was in a compliant status. Although initially discriminatory, the modifications in 1955 realigned the trust with legal requirements. However, since full compliance occurred post-1953, the respondent's argument holds merit. Hence, the $25,000 deduction for 1953, appearing to lack initial statutory compliance, cannot be upheld for that year. The deduction is disallowed, aligning with 27 T.C. 372's stipulation on trust validity and timely, compliant payments.

Given these precedent cases, the respondent's determination must be sustained.

gold_text: By the very terms of the stockholders’ resolution and the terms of the trust instrument, the effective date of the trust was January 1, 1954. Petitioner does argue that, even though the effective date of the trust was January 1, 1954, the controlling date is the date in which the plan was adopted, citing Tollman Tool & Machine Corporation, 27 T.C. 372 (1956). In that case, as well as in Crow-Burlingame Co., 15 T.C. 738 (1950), dealing with a similar problem, the effective dates of the trusts were the same as the dates in which the resolutions were adopted creating the trusts. Eespondent had argued unsuccessfully in Tollman Tool & Machine Corporation and Crow-Burlingame Co., both supra, that no trust could exist until moneys were in fact paid into it thereby creating the trust reserve. We held that the expressed intention of the stockholders and the board of directors controlled the existence of the trusts. In the instant case, however, petitioner’s stockholders expressly stated that the effective date of the trust was to be January 1, 1954. Petitioner had incurred no liability which could properly be accrued on December 31, 1953, or which could be enforced by the employees at any time during 1953; nor did the employees’ rights under the trust become fixed prior to January 1, 1954. All events must occur which fix the amount of the expense and determine the liability of the taxpayer to pay it before an expense item may accrue. United States v. Anderson, 269 U.S. 422 (1926).
