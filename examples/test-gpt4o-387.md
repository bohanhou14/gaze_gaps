**Generation:**

Amendola and Swor's claims hinge on identifying adverse employment actions that meet the necessary standards under USERRA. According to the district court's findings and the precedent established, mere trivial harms or personality conflicts do not suffice as actionable retaliation (495 F.3d 906). Only significant injuries or harms that would dissuade a reasonable person from making or supporting a charge of discrimination qualify (126 S.Ct. 2405 at 2415). 

For their claims, plaintiffs need to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that their employer's actions were motivated by protected activities and were materially adverse (38 F.3d 968). The district court concluded that Johnson's actions, described by Amendola and Swor, ranging from denial of vacation time to critical emails, did not rise to the level of significant adverse employment actions. Their allegations, ultimately, involved minor slights and administrative decisions, not actions producing a material disadvantage or significant harm in employment terms.

Consequently, with no compelling evidence supporting a materially adverse action influenced by their USERRA activities, the district court's grant of summary judgment was warranted and properly applied. Thus, we affirm the district court's ruling.

gold_text: Applying the material adversity standard to the claims of Amendola and Swor, the actions of which Amendola and Swor complain do not rise to the level of actionable retaliation. These are the garden-variety complaints about minor slights and disagreements with supervisors that are not protected by USERRA. A federal court does not sit as a super-personnel department that oversees a company’s general employment practices and guarantees to each employee a genial boss. See, e.g., Gilbert v. Des Moines Area Cmty. Coll., 495 F.3d 906, 916 (8th Cir.2007); Harvey v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 38 F.3d 968, 973 (8th Cir.1994). Because the “retaliations” claimed by Amendola and Swor were not materially adverse employment actions, the district court did not err in granting Gold Cross and Johnson’s motion for summary judgment.
