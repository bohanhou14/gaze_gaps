In the present case, the RTC has claimed entitlement to delinquency charges stipulated in the mortgage agreement for untimely payments. However, under New Jersey law, charges imposed for late payments must constitute fair compensation for administrative costs incurred due to the delay. As established in Crest Savings and Loan Ass’n v. Mason, 243 N.J.Super. 646, 581 A.2d 120 (Ch.Div.1990), such charges must be a genuine pre-estimate of the administrative expenses incurred by the lender.

In the bankruptcy context, courts scrutinize these charges to assess whether they serve as a compensation mechanism or a penalty. Following the logic laid out in In re L.H.D. Realty Corp., 20 B.R. 722, 725 (Bankr.S.D.Ind.1982), where it was deemed that late charges without evidence of genuine administrative expense correlation were considered penalties.

Furthermore, the court in In re Tastyeast, Inc., 126 F.2d 879, 881 (3d Cir.) cert. den. Modern Factors Co. v. Tastyeast, Inc., 316 U.S. 696 (1942), found that provisions resembling penalties, irrespective of state law acceptance, are unenforceable in bankruptcy. Since the RTC's late charges were admitted as inducements for prompt payment, and do not correlate to an exact administrative expense, they are analogous to the penalties discussed in In re Tastyeast, 126 F.2d 879 and further solidified by judicial rationale found in In re White, 88 B.R. 498 (Bkrtcy.D.Mass.1988).

Thus, this Court finds that the RTC's claim for delinquency charges is an unenforceable penalty under both state and federal bankruptcy law, mirroring principles from the aforementioned reference cases.

gold_text: In addition to bearing a relationship to the amount of actual loss incurred by the creditor, the primary purpose of the clause cannot be to compel prompt payment. In re Oahu Cabinets, Ltd., 12 B.R. 160, 165 (Bkrtcy.D.Haw.1981). Again, Ms. Kava-naugh testified that the 5% late charge was also “intended to coerce performance” by the debtor. (Transcript pgs. 20-21). Accordingly, this Court holds that the contractual provision providing for a late charge of 5% for any monthly interest installment not received within fifteen days is an unenforceable penalty. See In re Tastyeast, Inc., 126 F.2d 879 (3d Cir.1942).
