**Generation:**

The Drivers' reliance on anticipated injuries and speculative harms to assert ripeness fails as their arguments mirror premature challenges considered by courts previously. In *Reference case 442 U.S. 289*, the appellees' challenge was deemed premature, underscoring that abstract disagreements without concrete applicability aren't ripe for judicial review. Similarly, *Reference case 262 U.S. 553* establishes that a prospective injury must be certainly impending to obtain relief. Here, the Drivers' alleged injuries are speculative, not concrete or imminent. 

Moreover, *Reference case 414 U.S. 488* focuses on addressing issues with actual applicability backed by substantial facts. Applying this principle, the Drivers' stated injuries under NLRA ยง 8(e) and ยง 8(b)(4) lack a factual basis of an existing or imminent contract or coercive union campaign, rendering their claims speculative and unripe. Thus, pursuant to these principles, we conclude that the Drivers' claims remain unripe for adjudication.

gold_text: Finally, the Drivers cite to authorities that do not support their position. The Drivers cite to Babbitt v. United Farm Workers National Union , 442 U.S. 289, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979), for the proposition that the Drivers need not "await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief." Id. at 298, 99 S.Ct. 2301 (quoting Pennsylvania v. West Virginia , 262 U.S. 553, 593, 43 S.Ct. 658, 67 L.Ed. 1117 (1923) ). However, the Drivers ignore the language surrounding the quoted sentence, which makes clear that an injury that is "certainly impending ... is enough," id. (emphasis added) (quoting Pennsylvania , 262 U.S. at 593, 43 S.Ct. 658 ), and that "[a] plaintiff who challenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute's operation or enforcement," id. (emphasis added) (citing O'Shea v. Littleton , 414 U.S. 488, 494, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974) ). As discussed above, the Drivers' theories of injury do not meet these criteria.
