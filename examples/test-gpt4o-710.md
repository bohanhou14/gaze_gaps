Furthermore, the plaintiffs in error argue that the trial court unduly restricted their cross-examination of government witnesses. In *Reference case 255 F. 264*, it was noted that the trial judge is in the best position to determine the extent of cross-examination. Given the number of witnesses and the context of their testimonies, the restriction on cross-examination was deemed appropriate to prevent undue humiliation and repetitive examination, as seen in the cited case.

Additionally, objections were raised regarding the exclusion of certain lines of inquiry during cross-examination intended to reveal other potential perpetrators of the crime, as claimed in *Reference case 294 F. 633*. The court ruled these inquiries immaterial for not closely bearing on the defendants' alleged conspiracy. This approach aligns with the proper judicial discretion exercised in assessing the relevance of cross-examination, ensuring the focus remains on the indicted conspiracy.

In both reference cases, *255 F. 264* and *294 F. 633*, the courts upheld limitations on cross-examination and the exclusion of evidence unrelated to the primary conspiracy, similar to the rulings in the present case.
