In determining Divers' fiduciary status, it is crucial to adhere to the judicial precedents established in prior cases. The Ninth Circuit has emphasized that authority over plan assets determines fiduciary status under ERISA. In *Yeseta v. Baima*, 837 F.2d 380 (9th Cir. 1988), the court held that any exercise of control over plan assets renders an individual a fiduciary, regardless of authorization (51 F.3d 1449). Similarly, in *Parker*, the court affirmed fiduciary status for individuals exercising discretionary authority over plan assets, irrespective of their designation by the plan (68 F.3d 1131).

Additionally, the Second Circuit in *LaBarbara* supported the notion that delinquent employer contributions are regarded as plan assets (126 F.3d 34). This underscores the principle that unpaid contributions, once accrued, become vested trust assets.

Given Divers' role in directing payments and his decision to allocate assets away from the Trust Funds, Divers exercised sufficient control over plan assets to be deemed a fiduciary. This aligns with the Ninth Circuit's interpretation, which views functional control as the criterion for fiduciary responsibility (*IT Corp. v. General Am. Life Ins. Co.*, 107 F.3d 1415).

Thus, because Divers exercised authority over the funds that should have been contributed to the Trust Funds, he is liable as a fiduciary for breaching his duty under ERISA.

gold_text: Divers’ status as a corporate officer does not exempt him from liability. See Kayes v. Pacific Lumber Co., 51 F.3d 1449, 1459 (9th Cir.1995) (“This court has held corporate officers to be liable as fiduciaries on the basis of their conduct and authority with respect to ERISA plans.”). Rather, he is liable because, as established by the factual findings, he exercised authority and control over the management and disposition of the Trust Funds’ assets. See Parker v. Bain, 68 F.3d 1131, 1140 (9th Cir.1995) (finding individual who was company Vice President and majority owner to be a fiduciary because he ordered employees to withdraw plan assets to deposit into the corporation’s general account); Yeseta v. Baima, 837 F.2d 380, 386 (9th Cir.1988) (holding that employee who helped manage the business was a fiduciary under ERISA because he withdrew plan assets and placed them in the company’s account to cover “necessary operating expenses”); Lopresti v. Terwilliger, 126 F.3d 34, 40 (2nd Cir.1997) (holding that individual who paid company creditors instead of forwarding assets to the trust funds was a fiduciary); Connors v. Pay bra Mining Co., 807 F.Supp. 1242, 1246 (S.D.W.Va.1992) (concluding that company officers and directors were fiduciaries because they made “personal, conscious choices” to use withheld employee contributions to pay company expenses); PMTA-ILA Containerization Fund v. Rose, No. 94-5636, 1995 WL 461269, *5 (E.D.Pa. Aug.2, 1995) (“Courts have consistently held that employers who exercise discretionary control over funds that are designated for deposit into an ERISA fund qualify as fiduciaries.”).
