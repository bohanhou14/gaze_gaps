The decision is further reinforced by examining pertinent jurisprudence. In Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., 236 U.S. 412, the Supreme Court upheld the Commission's findings and interest awards in cases of overcharge disputes, emphasizing the necessity to compensate claimants fully for statutory violations. This principle was also affirmed in subsequent references, including 250 U.S. 368 and 63 L. Ed. 1039, where the courts reiterated that interest allowance was imperative to render whole those aggrieved by overcharges. These references provide robust jurisprudential support for the Commission's discretion in setting interest rates to ensure equitable restitution.

The order of the Commission, having been twice evaluated and upheld by Division 3 and reviewed by the entire Commission, aligns with established precedents. Therefore, the Court adopts the Commission's interpretation and upholds the allowance of 6% interest as consistent with legal standards and equitable remedy practices defined in the aforementioned cases.

Accordingly, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the overcharge amount of $29,206.33, along with 6% interest as determined by the Commission, validated by established legal precedents 236 U.S. 412, 250 U.S. 368, and 63 L. Ed. 1039.

The judgment is thus in favor of the plaintiff, affirming the Commission's decision and the stipulated interest rate.
