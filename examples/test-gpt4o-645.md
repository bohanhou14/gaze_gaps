In this case, Defendant challenges the district court’s determination that he was accountable for 2,414 grams of crack cocaine. Specifically, Defendant argues that the evidence presented did not sufficiently establish this quantity by a preponderance of the evidence, as required for sentencing purposes.

The government must prove the drug quantity attributable to a defendant by a preponderance of the evidence, as established in United States v. Randall, 171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir. 1999), and referenced in 667 F.3d 431. When direct evidence of drug quantity is lacking, the court may approximate the quantity based on reliable evidence. The Sentencing Guidelines permit sentencing courts to rely on a variety of methods to estimate drug quantities, provided the approximation ensures accuracy (667 F.3d 431).

In this case, several witnesses testified about receiving crack cocaine from Defendant, and the court relied on this testimony to approximate the drug quantity. According to United States v. Cook, 76 F.3d 596, 604 (4th Cir. 1996), reliance on direct or hearsay testimony is permissible, provided the district court exercises its discretion in assessing the credibility and reliability of such testimony. Here, the district court exercised its discretion and did not find clear error in attributing 2,414 grams of crack cocaine to Defendant, based on witness testimony and its approximation.

Therefore, given the discretion afforded to the district court in determining the method and evidence it credits (76 F.3d 596; United States v. Falesbork, 5 F.3d 715, 722 (4th Cir. 1993)), we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in its findings. 

Accordingly, we affirm both the denial of Defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and the sentencing determination attributing 2,414 grams of crack cocaine to Defendant.
