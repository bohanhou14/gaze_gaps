OPINION
PER CURIAM.
The case at hand concerns allegations of unfair labor practices by The Earthgrains Company (Earthgrains) towards its maintenance employees who were involved in a union representation election. Specifically, the employees claimed that Earthgrains withheld a wage increase, coercively interrogated them, and imposed a gag rule prohibiting union discussions.

In Handicaps, Inc., 318 N.L.R.B. 890, 896 (1995), enforced, 95 F.3d 681, 684-85 (8th Cir.1996), the Court held that a subjective notion of harassment is unknown to the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Similarly, in Le Tourneau Company of Georgia, the Court found that an employer may not confiscate union literature left for distribution to employees in non-work areas during non-work time.

Earthgrains' actions, as outlined in the case, demonstrate a clear violation of the NLRA. The company's withholding of the wage increase was motivated by anti-union sentiment, and its coercive interrogations and gag rule aimed to intimidate employees and discourage union activity. In 324 U.S. 793, the Court held that an employer's duty during the election process is to maintain the status quo and not change the benefits or conditions of employment in a way that may reasonably affect the outcome of the pending election.

In conclusion, the Board's findings of unfair labor practices by Earthgrains are supported by substantial evidence and are in line with the principles established in the NLRA. The company's actions were coercive, intimidating, and discriminatory, and therefore, violate the Act. We affirm the Board's decision and order Earthgrains to cease and desist from such practices.

gold_text: Soliciting support for a union and distributing union literature are two essential activities protected by the NLRA. Consol. Diesel Co. v. NLRB, 263 F.3d 345, 352 (4th Cir.2001). Furthermore, “the workplace is ‘uniquely appropriate’ for such activities, so long as the activities are conducted in nonwork areas during nonwork time and in a non-abusive manner.” Id. at 352 (quoting Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U.S. 793, 801 n. 6, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945) (internal citations omitted)). Thus, no-solicitation and no-distribution rules can be valid in the workplace, provided that they are not selectively applied against pro-union activity and do not spring up only when union activities begin.
