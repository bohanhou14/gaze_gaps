Fifth, Saenz-Jurado asserts he is actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted. To establish actual innocence, he must demonstrate that “it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him” in light of all the evidence. See Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 327-28 (1995); 523 U.S. 614. However, Saenz-Jurado has not presented new evidence that would meet this exacting standard. As noted in 232 F.3d 799, equitable tolling due to actual innocence requires substantial evidence and is applicable only in rare and exceptional circumstances. Without such evidence, his claim of actual innocence cannot justify equitable tolling.

Finally, regarding his request for the appointment of counsel, the district court correctly determined that there is no constitutional right to counsel in habeas proceedings. Our precedents do not warrant appointment of counsel given the lack of complexity and the straightforward procedural issues present. See 232 F.3d 799.

Accordingly, we DENY Saenz-Jurado’s request for a COA, his motion for appointment of counsel, and his application to proceed IFP.

gold_text: Fifth, equitable tolling is also appropriate when a defendant is actually innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted. Gibson v. Klinger; 232 F.3d 799, 808 (10th Cir.2000). Saenz-Jurado argues that he is innocent because the cocaine he was convicted of distributing belonged to someone else. But given his concession that the cocaine was found inside the vehicle he was driving (even though it was also occupied by another individual), he has made no showing that, “in light of all the evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him” of the offense. Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (quotation omitted). Further, Saenz-Jurado’s claim that the state court did not establish a factual basis for his conviction faces the same deficiency; he does not make the required showing of actual innocence.
