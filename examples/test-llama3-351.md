gold_text: Alternatively, even without a finding that the right to participate in the political process is a fundamental right, the State's sovereign immunity may be deemed validly abrogated "if Congress found pervasive unconstitutional state conduct." See Guttman , 669 F.3d at 1122-23. Pervasiveness has been found primarily in public higher education cases. See id. n.4 (citing Toledo v. Sanchez , 454 F.3d 24, 39-40 (1st Cir. 2006) ); see also Constantine v. Rectors & Visitors of George Mason Univ. , 411 F.3d 474, 490 (4th Cir. 2005) ; Bowers v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n , 475 F.3d 524, 555-56 (3rd Cir. 2007) ; Ass'n for Disabled Am. v. Fla. Int'l Univ. , 405 F.3d 954, 956-59 (11th Cir. 2005). Applying the factors identified in those cases-(1) a persistent pattern of exclusion and irrational treatment of disabled individuals, (2) the gravity of harm from such discrimination, and (3) limited compliance costs-the Court could arguably find that Oklahoma's sovereign immunity should be deemed abrogated in this case.
