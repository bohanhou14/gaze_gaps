CONCLUSIONS OF LAW (continued)

In assessing the Debtor’s plan, it is pertinent to analyze whether the plan was proposed in good faith. Applying the standards established in Public Finance Corp. v. Freeman, 712 F.2d 219, the court must view the "good faith" of the reorganization plan in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding its formulation. The bankruptcy judge is in the best position to assess the parties’ good faith, and in this scenario, the court finds that the Debtor has not exhibited such good faith.

The Debtor’s plan is reminiscent of the arguments presented in case 727 F.2d 1379, where the court emphasized the necessity of satisfying all requirements of Chapter 11 before the authorization of the sale. Here, the Debtor’s plan fails to meet these requirements as it does not provide for the prompt cure of defaults nor does it offer adequate assurances for future performance as per the obligations under the executory contracts.

Furthermore, akin to the finding in Public Finance Corp. v. Freeman, 712 F.2d 221, this court observes that the Debtor's proposal, which gambles on obtaining an unrealistic sale price for the property while failing to address accruing debts and timely payment obligations, is inconsistent with the objectives of the Bankruptcy Code aimed at fair reorganization and fresh start for the Debtor.

Based on these precedents and the clear indicators of bad faith in the Debtor’s plan, the court hereby denies the confirmation of the Debtor's reorganization plan.

ORDER
The proposed Plan of Reorganization by Love-Seemann Properties is hereby denied, and the appointment of a Trustee by Honolulu Limited is endorsed to ensure a fair and expedited resolution in the interests of all creditors involved.

So Ordered.
