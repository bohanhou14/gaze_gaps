The Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits adopt a different viewpoint, whereby the illegal seizure alone does not render the property immune from forfeiture but makes the government liable for any profits denied to the claimant during the period of unlawful seizure. This approach provides a balanced remedy for the constitutional violation. As noted in United States v. Real Property Located at 20832 Big Rock Drive, 51 F.3d 1402, 1406 (9th Cir.1995), and reaffirming the principle in United States v. Premises Known as RR # 1, 14 F.3d 864, 869 n. 5 (3d Cir.1994), government accountability for property earnings during illegal seizure is crucial. Following this logic, the Court concludes that Escobar is entitled to compensation for any deprivation caused by the unlawful seizure, without necessarily dismissing the forfeiture action, aligning with the reasoning seen in 58 F.3d 1181.

gold_text: On the other hand, the Second, Third, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuits are of the view that the illegal seizure does not, standing alone, require that the property be immune from forfeiture. See United States v. Real Property Located In El Dorado, 59 F.3d 974 (9th Cir.1995); United States v. All Assets and Equip. of West Side Bldg., 58 F.3d 1181, 1193 (7th Cir.1995); United States v. 51 Pieces of Real Property Roswell, N.M., 17 F.3d 1306 (10th Cir.1994); United States v. Premises Known as RR # 1, 14 F.3d 864, 869 n. 5 (3rd Cir.1994); United States v. Premises and Real Property at 4492 South Livonia Rd., 889 F.2d 1258, 1265-66 (2nd Cir.1989). Under this view, the government must remit any rents or profits accrued during the illegal seizure of the property. The recent Ninth Circuit Court case adds that an award of rent may not be the sole relief available, that claimants might also be entitled to damages for loss of use and enjoyment of the properties caused by the illegal seizure. United States v. Real Property Located In El Dorado, supra. The Tenth Circuit also concluded that any constitutional harm could be remedied by the suppression of any evidence gained through the illegal seizure. 51 Pieces of Real Property, 17 F.3d at 1316.
