In evaluating Plaintiff's claims, it is crucial to consider relevant case law. In 560 F.2d 925, the court addressed the constitutional right to due process and the proper assertion of such claims under federal question jurisdiction. Similarly, in 408 U.S. 564, the Court examined procedural protections afforded to individuals, emphasizing the need for a substantive basis for employment decisions linked to due process rights.

Applying these principles, Plaintiff’s contention that he was denied due process must be supported by a legitimate expectation of continued employment or appointment. As established in 408 U.S. 564, the lack of tenure or a guaranteed position does not inherently violate due process unless statutory or contractual provisions confer such protections. Here, Plaintiff was never formally included on the list and thus did not possess a protected property interest in the appointments.

Additionally, Plaintiff's claim under the equal protection clause requires demonstrating that he was treated differently from similarly situated individuals without a rational basis. According to 560 F.2d 925, Plaintiff must provide evidence that other attorneys were favored arbitrarily, which is not sufficiently shown in this context.

Given these considerations, Plaintiff fails to establish a violation of constitutional rights justifying judicial intervention under the precedent set by 560 F.2d 925 and 408 U.S. 564.

gold_text: The Court can frankly find no statutory basis of jurisdiction. It could be argued that there is a direct right of action under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Cf. Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971); Owen v. City of Independence, 560 F.2d 925 (8th Cir. 1977). Assuming such a right of action plaintiff must still demonstrate that he was once on the appointments list and held a federally protected property interest in that status. See Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564,92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). He has shown neither.
