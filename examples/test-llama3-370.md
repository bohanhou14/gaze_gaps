The case at hand presents a question of whether Congress may ratify retroactively the institution of a lawsuit by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce the Equal Pay Act requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. § 206(d) (1982). The EEOC filed a complaint against Westinghouse Electric Corporation (Westinghouse) on May 20, 1983, charging that Westinghouse had violated the Equal Pay Act by paying lower wages to female employees than to male employees performing equal work. The Reorganization Act of 1977, 5 U.S.C. § 901 et seq., authorized the EEOC to institute the suit, but the legislative veto provision in the Act was found unconstitutional in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983).

In response to the EEOC's appeal from the district court's judgment dismissing the complaint, Congress passed Public Law 98-532, which ratified all reorganization plans taken pursuant to prior reorganization acts, including the Reorganization Act of 1977. The EEOC moved to vacate the judgment of dismissal and to remand for further proceedings, arguing that P.L. 98-532 applied retroactively and validated its authority to enforce the Equal Pay Act. Westinghouse contended that P.L. 98-532 should not be given retroactive effect and that the EEOC lacked authority to enforce the Equal Pay Act at the time the suit was filed.

The court held that P.L. 98-532 is retroactive and applies to the EEOC's enforcement action. In Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd. v. United States, 300 U.S. 297, 301-02, 57 S.Ct. 478, 479-80, 81 L.Ed. 659 (1937), the Supreme Court recognized that Congress has the power to enact retroactive legislation ratifying actions that were taken prior to the enactment of the statute. Furthermore, the court noted that the "change in law" at issue here is different in kind from the change at issue in Bradley v. Richmond School Board, 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d

gold_text: First, Congress did not create jurisdiction over this lawsuit in enacting P.L. 98-532. The district courts have had federal question jurisdiction over such claims since the Equal Pay Act was enacted in 1964. See 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (1982). The authority of one executive agency or another to institute such suits is properly characterized as a question of standing, and not one of jurisdiction. Second, no reason has been suggested why a retroactive transfer of standing to sue from one agency to another should be viewed under any different principles from those governing retroactive legislation generally. Certainly the retroactive change wrought here has less impact on substantive rights of individuals than decisions, for example, to tax attorneys’ fees, Bradley, 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476, to require employers to compensate their employees, Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976), or to assess withdrawal penalties in the pension fund context, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. R.A. Gray & Co., — U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2709, 2718-19, 81 L.Ed.2d 601 (1984), all of which have been given retroactive effect despite due process challenges.
