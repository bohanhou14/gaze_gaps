The court grants in part and denies in part defendants' motion to dismiss. The court grants dismissal of count one, as dismissal is unopposed by Stanley Demster. The court also grants dismissal of count three. While the court finds that it has subject matter jurisdiction, and that plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a § 1983 claim for false arrest, the court finds that defendants are shielded by qualified immunity. The court, however, denies defendants' motion to dismiss count four because the court has subject matter jurisdiction and plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a § 1983 claim for malicious prosecution.

In count four, Karen and Renee Demster allege that Officers Trevino, Velasquez, Flack and/or McCormack maliciously prosecuted plaintiffs in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The court finds that plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a § 1983 malicious prosecution claim, and, therefore, deny defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). The court also denies defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) because defendants challenge the complaint facially, and the court finds that plaintiffs alleged a constitutional violation, giving the court subject matter jurisdiction based upon a federal claim.

Plaintiffs request leave to amend their complaint to add additional facts to support their false arrest claim. The court denies this request because allowing the pleading of additional facts would not alter the court's finding that the officers are shielded by qualified immunity. See Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998).

In conclusion, the court grants in part and denies in part defendants' motion to dismiss. The court denies defendants' motion to dismiss count four, and denies plaintiffs' request for leave to amend their complaint. See Siegert v. Gilley,

gold_text: Karen and Renee Demster argue that if the court believes they have not pled sufficient specific, non-conclusory allegations of fact to allow the district court to determine whether or not defendants are entitled to qualified immunity for plaintiffs’ false arrest claim, plaintiffs should be able to amend their complaint, citing Dill v. City of Edmond, 155 F.3d 1193, 1204 (10th Cir.1998) and Watson v. City of Kansas City, Kansas, 80 F.Supp.2d 1175, 1185 (D.Kan.1999). These cases, however, took place under a heightened pleading requirement formerly in place in the Tenth Circuit in cases where there was a qualified immunity defense, and the Tenth Circuit expressly stated in Currier v. Doran, 242 F.3d 905 (10th Cir.2001) that such a standard is no longer permissible as a result of Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998). As heightened pleading is no longer required, there remains no justification for allowing leave to amend as a matter of course in cases where qualified immunity is asserted as a defense. Moreover, even under a conventional discretionary standard, this is not a case where leave to amend should be granted. Here, Karen and Renee Dem-ster clearly state that they had to be restrained from approaching Stanley Dem-ster. This is the act which is analyzed while looking at defendants’ qualified im munity defense, and there are not any additional facts that plaintiffs could plead to defeat that defense. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) (leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires, unless the amendment would be futile); see Bauchman ex rel. Bauchman v. West High Sch., 132 F.3d 542, 559 (10th Cir.1997). The court, therefore, denies plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend.
