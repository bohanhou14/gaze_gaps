**Generation:**

While Brown raised concerns about the vocational expert’s (VE’s) testimony, particularly regarding the departure from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles and the data sources for job-related opinions, these objections were largely forfeited due to the lack of timely objection during the administrative hearing. An error, if any, was determined to be harmless.

This scenario is similar to the judicial reasoning found in the reference case 811 F.3d 969, where the application of res judicata was barred due to similar procedural shortcomings. Here, we see a parallel in the procedural aspect as Brown's failure to timely raise objections undermines her current challenge.

Moreover, referencing 559 F.3d 736, the court stipulates that procedural defaults can often mitigate the impact of potentially reversible errors if they do not affect the overall outcome. This aligns with our conclusion that even if the VE's testimony had procedural flaws, the error did not alter the ALJ's final decision about Brown's disability status substantially.

Thus, we find no reversible error in the ALJ’s reliance on the vocational expert’s testimony. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed in this respect.

III. CONCLUSION
While the ALJ adequately considered Brown's obesity, the improper application of the Treating Physician Rule necessitates a remand for further proceedings. However, the challenge to the VE's testimony does not warrant reversal. For these reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

gold_text: The ALJ determined that Brown could perform substantial gainful activity based primarily on testimony from a vocational expert regarding six particular jobs. Brown attacks the ALJ’s reliance on this testimony on several grounds. For example, Brown claims that the ALJ erred in accepting the vocational expert’s testimony that all six jobs could be performed sitting or standing and that the worker could be off task up to 10% of the time while doing so. However, Brown concedes that this testimony merely supplemented (and did not conflict with) the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), which means that she forfeited these arguments by failing to object to the testimony during the administrative hearing. Liskowitz v. Astrue, 559 F.3d 736, 744 (7th Cir. 2009) (claimant forfeited argument regarding reliability of data underlying vocational experts’ job-numbers opinions by failing to object during hearing); Barrett v. Barnhart, 355 F.3d 1065, 1067 (7th Cir. 2004) (same). Brown also forfeited her argument regarding the vocational expert’s testimony about the number of positions for each of the six jobs by failing to object during the hearing. Id. And to the extent Brown alleges error in the ALJ’s acceptance of the vocational expert’s testimony relating to the telephone solicitor/call center position, Brown waived the issue by failing to raise it in her opening appellate brief. Bonnstetter v. City of Chi, 811 F.3d 969, 973 (7th Cir. 2016).
