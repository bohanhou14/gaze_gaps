The principles elucidated in the precedents, particularly regarding summary judgment, guide our analysis. In accordance with the standards set forth in 477 U.S. 317 and 477 U.S. 242, we must determine if any genuine issues of material fact remain and whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. As stated in 477 U.S. 242, the existence of some factual disputes does not preclude summary judgment; the disputes must be material to affect the outcome under the substantive law.

The appellees, per the material records and sworn affidavits, have consistently shown that they were regularly scheduled to work on Sundays. The government's reliance on minor discrepancies in individual complaints does not rise to the level of a genuine issue of material fact, as the need for specific, material disputes is emphasized in 477 U.S. 317.

Therefore, in line with our precedents and the absence of any substantive factual disputes, we affirm the Claims Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for Sunday premium pay during authorized leave periods.

gold_text: Appellees’ motion for summary judgment on this ground was accompanied by sworn declarations attesting to the fact that Sundays were part of the appellees’ regularly scheduled workweek. This evidence was unrebutted by the government at the motion for summary judgment. Upon presentation of such evidence, the burden of avoiding entry of summary judgment shifts to the nonmovant to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact precluding entry of such a judgment. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (summary judgment motion may be opposed by the nonmoving party by “any of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves. . . .”); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Since this burden was not met by the government in this case, summary judgment was appropriate. “Regularly scheduled” furthermore need not be interpreted as requiring scheduling on every single Sunday of each month. Rather, all that the language requires is that the scheduling be “regular” as opposed to intermittent. Finally, no challenge is made to the determination by the Claims Court that “the material facts as to liability are undisputed.” Armitage, 23 Cl.Ct. at 484.
