The next legal issue pertains to whether punitive damages, awarded by the Greene County Circuit Court, are also nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(2)(A). According to the U.S. Supreme Court in Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U.S. 213, all liabilities arising from fraudulent conduct, including punitive damages, should be nondischargeable. This interpretation aligns with the rationale that fraudulent actions should bear comprehensive financial responsibility, thus rendering punitive damages nondischargeable.

Additionally, the Supreme Court case (523 U.S. 213) and its reaffirmation in Cohen, 118 S.Ct. 1212, establish that compensatory and punitive damages resulting from “actual fraud” must be treated as nondischargeable. This means the Greene County Circuit Court’s awards, including $45,176.82 in actual damages and $150,000 in punitive damages, fall squarely within this scope of nondischargeability under § 523(a)(2)(A).

Therefore, based on these precedents and the findings of fraud in the Greene County case, all awarded damages should be considered nondischargeable, reinforcing the comprehensive liability for fraudulent acts as stipulated in these cases.
