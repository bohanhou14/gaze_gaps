Defendant further contends that any penalties or sanctions for asserting constitutional rights should be deemed coercive and therefore, a violation of the Fifth Amendment. In support of this argument, she cites *Lefkowitz v. Turley*, 414 U.S. 70, where the Supreme Court held that a waiver secured under threat of substantial economic sanctions cannot be termed voluntary. The court found that disqualification from public contracting for five years, as a penalty for asserting a constitutional privilege, is violative of Fifth Amendment rights.

Moreover, defendant invokes *Spevack v. Klein*, 385 U.S. 511, which extended the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment through the Fourteenth Amendment, to lawyers as well as other individuals, indicating that the imposition of any sanction for asserting this privilege makes the assertion costly and unconstitutional. As articulated in *Garrity v. New Jersey*, 385 U.S. 493, the court emphasized that despite choosing between unfavorable alternatives, any choice made under duress does not exclude the presence of coercion.

However, these precedents are fundamentally different from the present case. Here, the IRS did not condition Walker's employment or contractual status on her waiver of the Fifth Amendment right. Instead, any potential misrepresentation by Lake during his undercover investigation did not amount to penalty or compulsion but was part of legitimate investigative tactics recognized and upheld by precedent. Therefore, while these cases illustrate the principle that coercion invalidates voluntary waivers of constitutional rights, they do not apply to undercover operations absent custodial interrogation.

For the reasons stated, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.

gold_text: Again, for the same reason, we summarily dismiss defendant’s claim that her statements were involuntary because she made them under economic duress. She states that Lake lured her with promises to purchase her business at a time when she was most vulnerable and cites Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 94 S.Ct. 316, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (1973); Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511, 87 S.Ct. 625, 17 L.Ed.2d 574 (1967); and Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 562 (1967), in support of her position. Unlike the present case, custodial interrogation clearly occurred in each of those cases. Additionally, each of those defendants was confronted with a Hobson’s choice and thus the magnitude of the duress greatly exceeded that which defendant here alleges.
