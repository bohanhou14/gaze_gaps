In the given cases, we can see that the courts have emphasized the importance of presenting sufficient evidence to support a claim. In the case of 395 F.3d 516, the court held that the presence of signs prohibiting public entry established that the access road was not open to public use, and thus, was not a highway under Virginia law. Similarly, in the case of 210 F.3d 240, the court ruled that the plaintiff had failed to forecast evidence creating a genuine issue of fact about whether its injuries were proximately caused by the defectiveness of the product.

In the case at hand, Toll's claims for unjust enrichment, unfair trade practices, and product liability are based on the alleged defective design of Dryvit's EIFS. However, Toll has failed to present sufficient evidence to support its claims. The court's conclusion that the proximate cause of Toll's dispute and settlement with the homeowners was Toll's misrepresentation to them that the homes would be clad in actual, rather than synthetic, stucco is supported by the record.

Furthermore, the court's ruling that Toll was not entitled to indemnification from Imperial is also supported by the record. The agreement between Toll and Imperial states that Imperial must indemnify Toll "from and against all claims, damages, losses and expenses... arising out of or resulting from the performance of [Imperial's] Work." J.A. 668. However, the problem was not with Imperial's performance, but with the defective design of the EIFS, which was outside of Imperial's control.

In conclusion, based on the evidence presented, the court's decision to grant summary judgment in favor of Appellees is supported. Toll's claims are based on insufficient evidence, and the court's conclusions are reasonable and supported by the record.

gold_text: Appellees maintain that to the extent that summary judgment should otherwise be reversed, it should be affirmed on the basis of spoliation of the evidence. Specifically, Appellees complain of Tollâ€™s removing the EIFS and disposing of it without alerting them or giving them an opportunity to determine if the systems, as they were actually installed, were defective. This court is of course free to affirm a judgment on any ground appearing in the record. See United States v. Smith, 395 F.3d 516, 519 (4th Cir.2005). But, because the district court has not yet addressed the spoliation issue, we will refrain from ruling on it at this time. See Silvestri v. Gen. Motors Corp., 210 F.3d 240, 245 (4th Cir.2000) (holding that the question of whether a case should be dismissed because of spoliation is one for the district court to address in the first instance).
