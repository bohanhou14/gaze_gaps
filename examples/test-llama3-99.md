In construing the insurance policy at issue, the court must consider the intent of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract. The court may look to extrinsic evidence to resolve ambiguities and determine the parties' intent. In this case, the court must consider the language of the policy, including the "Exclusion â€” Designated Professional Services" endorsement, to determine the scope of coverage.

The court may also consider the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, such as the parties' negotiations and any representations made by the insurer. In this case, the parties may have intended to exclude coverage for public officials' liability, but the court must consider all of the evidence before making a determination.

In determining the scope of coverage, the court must also consider the principles of insurance law, including the doctrine of utmost good faith and the duty to act in good faith. The court must also consider the insurance company's obligations under the policy, including its duty to defend and indemnify the insured.

In this case, the court must balance the parties' interests and determine the scope of coverage based on the language of the policy and the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract. The court may consider extrinsic evidence, such as the parties' negotiations and any representations made by the insurer, to resolve any ambiguities and determine the parties' intent.

gold_text: The law of this circuit is clear that when the written contract is clear and unequivocal, there is no need to resort to extrinsic evidence. See Bohler-Uddeholm Am. Inc. v. Ellwood Group, Inc., 247 F.3d 79, 92 (3rd Cir.2001). On the other hand, our cases have permitted consideration of extrinsic evidence in order to determine whether the ambiguity can be resolved. See Sikirica v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 214, 220 (3rd Cir.2005); Pacific Indem. Co. v. Linn, 766 F.2d 754, 761 (3rd Cir.1985).
