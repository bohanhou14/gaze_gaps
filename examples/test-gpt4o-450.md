In determining the standards for criminal responsibility, reference to case 214 F.2d 879 clearly delineates the role of the jury in new trials concerning mental condition issues. The court emphasized that treating factual issues as settled without jury determination constitutes reversible error due to the defective nature of the charge. Similarly, the retrial of Stewart must apply the broadened test of criminal responsibility announced in Durham v. United States.

Additionally, as highlighted in case 247 F.2d 42, the fundamental issue in these appeals remains Stewart's sanity at the time of the offense. The appellate court has consistently recognized the necessity of examining the evidence of criminal responsibility, ensuring it meets the standards set by Durham. Despite the new psychiatric examinations being argued as insufficient, the court found that these evaluations, if competent by medical standards, remain valid under the new test.

These precedents reinforce our requirement to provide Stewart with a new trial adhering to correct legal standards while ensuring the jury's role in determining criminal responsibility based on comprehensive and contemporary expert testimony.
