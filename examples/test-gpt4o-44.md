**Generation:**

AutoZone's contention that the district court erred in excluding Right’s 1998 CAR is akin to the situation in **reference case 228 F.3d 872**. There, the court noted that evidence not raised in a pre-verdict motion cannot be reconsidered post-trial. Similarly, AutoZone did not present the CAR during the pre-termination decision process, rendering it irrelevant.

Moreover, AutoZone's argument that the district court erred in not considering the CARs and termination notices of other employees is supported by **reference case 161 F.3d 491**. The court in that case emphasized that comparisons to other employees require that they be similarly situated in all relevant respects. As with Denesha, who produced sufficient evidence to allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination, Right provided adequate evidence showing that the younger employees cited by AutoZone were not similarly situated due to differing misconduct and decision-makers.

These precedents underscore that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the CAR and other termination notices, nor did it err in submitting the willfulness instruction to the jury. The evidence supported the jury's finding of discriminatory intent, warranting affirmance of the damages and denial of a new trial.

gold_text: AutoZone finally argues that there was insufficient evidence in support of the verdict so the district court should have granted its motion for judgment as a matter of law. Denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law is reviewed de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. Belk v. City of Eldon, 228 F.3d 872, 878 (8th Cir.2000). The standard of review for sufficiency of proof in an age discrimination suit is “whether [the plaintiff] produced sufficient evidence to allow a jury reasonably to find that [the employer] intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of his age.” Denesha v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, 161 F.3d 491, 497 (8th Cir.1998) (citation omitted).
