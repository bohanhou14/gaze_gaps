In the case of Holland v. United States, the court considered whether the applicable regulations, specifically 43 C.F.R. §§ 4.450-6 and 4.450-7(a), effectuated a denial of due process to the parties involved. The court held that the regulations, as applied, did not deny due process to the parties. The court based its decision on the Mathews factors, considering the private interest affected by the government action, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest, and the government's interest.

In applying the Mathews factors, the court found that the private interest affected by the government action was not as high as claimed by the parties. The court noted that the validity of the mining claims was disputed and that the regulations provided for a ten-day grace period for documents transmitted before the end of the period. The court also found that the risk of erroneous deprivation was low, as the parties were given actual notice of the contest complaint and the opportunity to respond.

The court further held that the government's interest in ensuring the prompt and efficient handling of contest complaints outweighed any potential burdens of applying the regulations consistently. The court noted that if the government were to allow a three-day grace period, it would likely lead to inconsistent application of the regulations and undermine the purpose of having a deadline.

In reaching its decision, the court drew parallels with other cases, including 408 U.S. 564 and 96 F.3d 355. The court recognized that the regulations at issue were mandatory and that the parties had failed to comply with them. The court also noted that the regulations provided for a hearing and that the parties had waived their right to a hearing by failing to timely file an answer.

In conclusion, the court held that the applicable regulations did not effectuate a denial of due process to the parties involved. The court's decision was based on the Mathews factors, which considered the private interest affected by the government action, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest, and the government's interest. The court found that the regulations were consistent with due process and that the government's interest in ensuring the prompt and efficient handling of contest complaints outweighed any potential burdens of applying the regulations consistently.

Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569-70 & n. 7, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)). It is undisputed that plaintiffs received adequate notice of the applicable regulations and of their right to a hearing. Plaintiffs were also given an opportunity to be heard. The fact that plaintiffs did not exercise their right to a hearing under the regulations by timely filing an answer is not the fault of the regulations. “The Constitution requires due process of law; it does not require an endless number of opportunities for one to assert his rights.” Silas v.
