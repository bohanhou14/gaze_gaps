However, due to Plaintiff's pro se status, the allegations and filings should be construed liberally. As established in Zichko v. Idaho, 247 F.3d 1015, courts have a duty to construe pro se pleadings liberally, especially in cases involving pro se prisoners. This principle extends to pro se litigants generally, including those involved in tax disputes, as seen in Christiansen v. Commissioner, 786 F.2d 1382. Additionally, the Ninth Circuit case Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police Department, 839 F.2d 621, emphasizes that when dismissing a pro se complaint due to procedural deficiencies, courts should allow the plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint to correct such defects.

Applying this standard, the Court notes Plaintiff’s pro se status and the necessity to afford Plaintiff the opportunity to address any procedural deficiencies, such as failure to specifically allege receipt of a right-to-sue letter or to identify the proper defendant for the rescission claim. Therefore, while granting summary judgment on the grounds of the untimeliness of the rescission claim for the First Mortgage based on § 1635(f), the Court DENIES the motion for summary judgment on the Second Mortgage to allow Plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint to correctly address the procedural requirements and substantiate the foreclosure claim.

gold_text: This Court finds Defendant’s argument regarding the Second Mortgage unpersuasive. First, courts have a duty to construe pro se pleadings liberally, including pro se motions as well as complaints. See Zichko v. Idaho, 247 F.3d 1015, 1020 (9th Cir.2001) (acknowledging that courts must construe pro se prisoner motions and pleadings liberally); see also Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police Dep% 839 F.2d 621, 623 (9th Cir.1988) (“In civil rights cases where the plaintiff appears pro se, the court must construe the pleadings liberally and must afford plaintiff the benefit of any doubt.”); Christensen v. CIR, 786 F.2d 1382, 1384 (9th Cir.1986) (construing a pro se taxpayer’s motion to “place statements in the record” as a motion to amend). Not only is Plaintiff acting pro se, she is also the non-moving party and therefore entitled to the interpretation most favorable to her position.
