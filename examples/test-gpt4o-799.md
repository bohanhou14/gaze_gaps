Kerrville's argument fails to meet the criteria laid out in the collateral order doctrine. Drawing from case law, it is evident that not all interlocutory orders are immediately appealable. In Reference case 638 F.2d 1357 (citing 636 F.2d 81 (5th Cir. 1981)), the Fifth Circuit outlined that to be reviewable under the collateral order doctrine, an order must be independent and easily separable from the substance of other claims, present a need to secure prompt review to protect important interests, and be examined based on practical considerations. 

In the current case, the district court’s dismissal of Kerrville's counterclaims does not meet these criteria. The order is intricately tied to the principal suit as both revolve around the EEOC’s investigation, which precludes it from being easily separable. Additionally, Kerrville has not demonstrated a prompt need for review to protect any important interest, failing to pass the practical considerations test as identified in Reference case 913 F.2d 205.

Moreover, in Reference case 704 F.2d 144, the Fifth Circuit reiterated that provisional denials by motions panels are subject to reconsideration and not indicative of the merits for interlocutory appeal. Therefore, the dismissal of Kerrville's counterclaims mirrors an interim resolution tied closely to the primary litigation, lacking the standalone nature required for a collateral order.

Ultimately, because the district court’s order fails to satisfy the elements of the collateral order doctrine, the interlocutory appeal cannot be justified. Thus, this Court lacks jurisdiction, and the appeal is dismissed.
