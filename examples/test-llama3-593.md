The court's comments to the jury in this case did not amount to plain error in light of the evidence in the case and the jury instructions taken as a whole. Unlike the case in United States v. Davila-Nater, 686 F.2d 863, where the court instructed the jury on the presumption of innocence at the beginning of the trial but not at the conclusion, the trial judge in this case did instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence at the beginning of the trial. Additionally, the court's comments were not as prejudicial as those in United States v. Fiorito, 855 F.2d 1528, where the trial judge explicitly instructed the jury that the court of appeals and the Supreme Court would review the judgment.

In this case, the court's comments were more akin to those in United States v. Varelli, 7 Cir. 1969, 407 F.2d 735, where the court noted that the government's evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The court's comments did not dilute the jury's responsibility for its verdict, as the jury was still required to make its own determination based on the evidence presented.

Furthermore, the court's comments did not rise to the level of plain error, as the prosecution's case was strong and the defense's arguments were weak. The prosecution presented sufficient evidence to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and the court's comments did not undermine the jury's ability to make a fair and impartial decision.

In conclusion, the court's comments to the jury in this case did not amount to plain error and did not prejudice the defendant's rights. The jury was able to make a fair and impartial decision based on the evidence presented, and the court's comments were consistent with the trial judge's previous instructions to the jury. Therefore, the court's comments did not rise to the level of plain error and did not warrant reversal of the conviction. <answer>
