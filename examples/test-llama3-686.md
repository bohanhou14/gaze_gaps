The Court must consider the requirement of security as mandated by Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In this case, Defendant contends that the Court failed to require the giving of security before issuing the preliminary injunction. However, the Court is of the opinion that this failure is not reversible error. As stated in Kerotest Manufacturing Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co., 342 U.S. 180, 183-84, 72 S.Ct. 219, 96 L.Ed. 200 (1952), the rule leaves it to the District Judge to order the giving of security in such sum as the court considers proper.

In the event that the Court determines injunctive relief to be proper, Defendant requests that the Court require Plaintiff to post a bond in the amount of $294,553.00, the additional access fee requested by Defendant. However, the Court believes that this request is excessive and not supported by the evidence presented. As stated in Urbain v. Knapp Brothers Manufacturing Co., 217 F.2d 810, the Court has the discretion to order the giving of security in such sum as the court deems proper.

In conclusion, the Court finds that Plaintiff has established a likelihood of success on the merits, and that without a preliminary injunction, Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm. The Court also finds that the potential harm to Defendant may be mitigated by placing appropriate conditions upon the grant of a preliminary injunction. Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, but requires Plaintiff to post a bond in the amount of $50,000.00.

The Court's decision is guided by the principles set forth in Meeropol v. Nizer, 505 F.2d 232, 235-37 (2d Cir. 1974), and Crosley Corp. v. Hazeltine Corp., 122 F.2d 925 (3d Cir. 1941). The Court's decision is also consistent with the requirements of Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
