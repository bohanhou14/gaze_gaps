The case at hand raises questions about the destruction of notes by a narcotic agent and the availability of an informer. In United States v. Comulada, 313 F.2d 757, the court held that the destruction of notes by an agent did not violate 18 U.S.C. § 3500. The notes were made as a precautionary measure and were incorporated into the agent's report. The court found that there was no reason to require the agent to keep the notes after they had served their purpose.

Regarding the availability of the informer, Scott, the court in United States v. Comulada, 313 F.2d 757, found that the government was not required to call Scott as a witness. The court noted that the defense never stated that it wished to call Scott as a witness and that the defense did not ask that the government produce Scott. The court also found that there was no reason to believe that Scott would have done more than duplicate the testimony already given by other witnesses.

In the case of United States v. Roviaro, 340 F.2d 453, the court held that the government was not required to disclose the identity of an informant to the defendant. The court found that the government's refusal to disclose the identity of the informant did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.

In the present case, the court's decision is supported by the evidence presented. The government's witnesses testified that they did not know Scott's whereabouts and that they had not seen him since February 1962. The defense never stated that it wished to call Scott as a witness and the defense did not ask that the government produce Scott. Therefore, the court's decision to deny the defense's motion to strike the government's witnesses' testimony is upheld.

In conclusion, the court's decision is supported by the evidence presented and is consistent with previous case law. The destruction of notes by an agent does not violate 18 U.S.C. § 3500, and the government is not required to call an informer as a witness. The court's decision to deny the defense's motion to strike the government's witnesses' testimony is upheld.

gold_text: We note that in case after case, in appeals from convictions for trafficking in narcotics, we hear arguments regarding the government’s failure to call the informer or special employee. See e. g., United States v. D’Angiolillo, 340 F.2d 453 (2 Cir.1965); United States v. Cimino, supra; United States v. Glaze, 313 F.2d 757 (2 Cir.1963); United States v. Colletti, 245 F.2d 781 (2 Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Russo v. United States, 355 U.S. 874, 78 S.Ct. 125, 2 L.Ed.2d 78 (1957); see also United States v. Lanza, 329 F.2d 422 (2 Cir.1964). It seems to be defense strategy to bring out facts from which it can be argued that the government or the court should have called the informer as a witness. Almost never is there a genuine effort to find the witness or to call him even when it is certain that he is available and subject to process. See United States v. D’Angiolillo, supra. We think that this is another such case.
