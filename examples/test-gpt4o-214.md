In determining whether plain error exists, we follow the guidelines set forth in United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-734 (1993). An error qualifies as plain if it affects substantial rights, meaning it must have impacted the outcome of the district court proceedings (id. at 734). This is consistent with the precedents that emphasize an error needs to seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings (United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160 (1936)).

The district court's retrospective application of § 3583(h) clearly satisfies the criteria for plain error as it resulted in Keith Dozier being subjected to a longer term of punishment than was authorized at the time he committed his original offense. The violation here serious enough to affect the fairness of judicial proceedings, as the ex post facto application increased Dozier's sentence potential, which constitutes plain error under the established jurisprudence (United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 455-456 (1986)) and impacts his substantial rights.

Given these circumstances, and in line with the discretion provided under Rule 52(b), this misconduct requires correction to uphold judicial integrity. Thus, we vacate Dozier's sentence and remand for resentencing in compliance with the statutory provisions in effect at the time of his original offense.

gold_text: We engage in a four-step analysis to determine whether an error can be corrected on appeal despite not having been raised in the trial court. We ask (1) whether there was an error, (2) that was plain, i.e. “clear” or “obvious,” (3) that affected substantial rights, and (4) that calls for the exercise of our discretion to take corrective action because the error creates a miscarriage of justice or seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. See United States v. Retos, 25 F.3d 1220, 1228-32 (3d Cir.1994) (deriving four steps from United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-79, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).
