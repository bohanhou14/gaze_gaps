The principle of "purposeful availment" ensures that a defendant will not be forced to litigate in a forum solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts. For jurisdiction to be appropriate, the defendant's contacts with the forum state must show that they deliberately engaged in significant activities within that state or created continuing obligations between themselves and residents of the forum (see 444 U.S. 286, Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235). Here, defendant's application for re-registration of the trademark in Massachusetts in 1993 serves as deliberate engagement in the state, aligning with the principles in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310.

Additionally, defendants must have clear notice that they are subject to suit in the forum state (471 U.S. 462, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson). The specific advertisement activities and mailings further indicate purposeful availment, supporting personal jurisdiction (see also 877 F.2d 1003, T.J. Smith & Nephew Ltd. v. Parke, Davis & Co.).

Thus, plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated that defendant purposefully availed themselves of the privileges of conducting activities in Massachusetts, meeting the due process requirement for personal jurisdiction.

gold_text: The defendant filed an allegedly fraudulent application for re-registration of the logo as a protected trademark in Massachusetts. In these circumstances, as a matter of law, the defendant should have anticipated the likelihood of being haled into court in Massachusetts. See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980). See also National Patent Dev. Corp. v. T.J. Smith & Nephew Ltd., 877 F.2d 1003, 1009-10 (D.C.Cir.1989) (regis tration of patent with United States Patent and Trademark Office by foreign national sufficient to constitute “purposeful availment” in this country). Furthermore, defendant’s acts leading to re-registration in 1993 were indisputably voluntary. See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985).
