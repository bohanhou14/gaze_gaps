Monzon argues that Counts 2 and 3 of his indictment were multiplicitous. Count 2 concerned possession with intent to distribute based on the 492 grams of cocaine distributed to Steinfest, while Count 3 focused on the 62 grams distributed to George. Monzon cites *United States v. Palafox*, 764 F.2d 558 (9th Cir.1985), to support his claim, positing that the charges stem from a single transaction, much like the situation in *Palafox* where possession and distribution arose from the same act (849 F.2d 886).

However, the court in *United States v. Privett*, 443 F.2d 528 (9th Cir.1971), held that possession of heroin in different locations and forms could constitute separate offenses if different acts and proofs are involved. Likewise, the assertion in *United States v. Madison*, 689 F.2d 1300 (7th Cir.1982), underscores the legislative intent to prosecute discrete transactions of drug trafficking as separate offenses (765 F.2d 677).

Here, the distribution to George and the possession with intent to distribute to Steinfest involved different acts and participants. Following the *Privett* and *Madison* precedents, Monzon’s charges in Counts 2 and 3 represent distinct offenses that support cumulative punishments and do not render the indictment multiplicitous. Thus, we find no merit in Monzon’s claim regarding multiplicity.

gold_text: The Ninth Circuit held that while Palafox could be charged with both crimes, he could not be sentenced for both. After examining the relevant legislative history and Supreme Court precedent, the court stated that: “when more than one offense arises under § 841(a)(1) from a single criminal undertaking involving drugs, and each offense is committed at virtually the same time, in the same place, and with the same participants, the punishments should not be compounded.” Id. at 562. Nevertheless, other cases have shown that where different purities of the controlled substance are involved, United States v. Privett, 443 F.2d 528, 531 (9th Cir.1971), United States v. Griffin, 765 F.2d 677, 683 (7th Cir.1985), different participants are involved, United States v. Elliott, 849 F.2d 886, 890 (4th Cir.1988), or the transactions occur at different times, Id., the Palafox rule does not apply and separate sentences are permissible.
