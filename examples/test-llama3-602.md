The cases presented, reference cases 815 F.2d 1122 and 851 F.2d 957, shed light on the interpretation of insurance policies. In the context of the insurance contract between Hudson Insurance Company and Gelman Sciences, Inc., it is clear that Hudson's liability is limited to Gelman's losses between $21 and $25 million. The contract explicitly states that Hudson's liability does not attach unless and until the insured or the insured's underlying insurance has paid or been held liable to pay the total underlying insurance limit of liability.

The court in Hudson Ins. Co. v. Gelman Sciences, Inc., 706 F.Supp. 25 (N.D.Ill.1989), correctly held that the contract is unambiguous in limiting Hudson's coverage to Gelman's liability between $21 and $25 million. This decision is supported by the plain language of the contract, which states that Hudson's liability shall be limited to the amount stated in Item 3 as applicable to "each occurrence," "each person" or "each claim," and further limited to the amount stated in Item 3 as "aggregate" with respect to each annual period while this policy is in force.

In Reserve Ins. Co. v. Pisciotta, 30 Cal.3d 800, 180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764, the court held that when an underlying insurer becomes insolvent, the insured cannot recover the amount of his policy, and thus the court can reasonably and fairly interpret the policy as making the excess insurer liable in that situation. However, this case is distinguishable from the present case, as the contract in Reserve Ins. Co. v. Pisciotta contains a provision allowing for liability in excess of amounts "recoverable" under underlying insurance policies. In contrast, the contract in the present case does not contain such a provision.

In conclusion, the court's decision in Hudson Ins. Co. v. Gelman Sciences, Inc. is supported by the plain language of the contract and the case law discussed above. Hudson's liability is limited to Gelman's losses between $21 and $25 million, and the company is not obligated to "drop down" and provide underlying coverage due to the primary insurer's insolvency.

gold_text: We find more appropriate a comparison with our decision in Zurich Ins. Co. v. Heil Co., 815 F.2d 1122 (7th Cir.1987). In a case applying Wisconsin law, we distinguished MacNeal’s “amount recoverable” language from an insurance contract with language similar to the Hudson-Gelman agreement. Relying on the “plain language” of the contract, we held that the excess insurer was not required to “drop down” to provide coverage for the insolvent underlying insurer. We reached a similar decision applying Indiana law in U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. Charter Financial Group, 851 F.2d 957 (7th Cir.1988). We again distinguished MacNeal because of the “amount recoverable” language, and found that the excess insurer need not “drop down,” stating that
