The court must decide whether the defendant, Mercy Catholic Medical Center, is covered by Title IX and whether the plaintiff, Jane Doe, has stated a claim for relief under Title IX. The court holds that the defendant is not an "education program or activity" as defined by Title IX, and therefore is not covered by the statute.

The court relies on the plain language of the statute, which defines an "education program or activity" as one that is operated by an educational institution. The court also notes that the defendant is a private hospital and is not an educational institution.

The court also rejects the plaintiff's argument that a medical residency program is an "education program or activity" because it provides training and education to residents. The court notes that while medical residency programs do provide training and education, they are not operated by educational institutions and therefore are not covered by Title IX.

The court also holds that the plaintiff's hostile environment claim is time-barred because it was not filed within the statute of limitations. The court concludes that the plaintiff's claims are not viable and must be dismissed.

The court's decision is consistent with other courts that have held that medical residency programs are not covered by Title IX. For example, in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S. 274 (1998), the Supreme Court held that a school district's decision to fire a teacher who was involved in a sexual relationship with a student was not a violation of Title IX.

Similarly, in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 864 F.2d 881 (1989), the court held that a state university's decision to fire a professor who was involved in a sexual relationship with a student was not a violation of Title IX.

The court's decision is also consistent with the plain language of Title IX, which defines an "education program or activity" as one that is operated by an educational institution. The court's decision is also consistent with the legislative history of Title IX, which indicates that Congress intended to address discrimination in educational institutions, not in private hospitals.

In conclusion, the court holds that the defendant is not an "education program or activity" as defined by Title IX, and therefore is not covered by the statute. The court also holds that the plaintiff's hostile environment claim is time-barred because it was not filed within the statute of limitations. The court's decision is consistent with other courts that have held that medical residency programs are not covered by Title IX

gold_text: . One case from the First Circuit held in passing that a medical resident was both a student and an employee. Lipsett v. Univ. of P.R., 864 F.2d 881, 897 (1st Cir.1988). Lip; sett, however, has been abrogated in substantial part by the Supreme Court’s decision in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S. 274, 286, 118 S.Ct. 1989, 141 L.Ed.2d 277 (1998). Gebser rejected the Lip-sett court’s attempt to equate Title IX to Title VII by noting conceptual differences between the statutes and setting a higher bar for institutional liability under Title IX (actual knowledge and deliberate indifference) than is applied in Title VII cases.
