**Generation:**

The situation presented here has similarities to previous rulings where the timing and actions regarding property appropriation and compensation were scrutinized. For instance, in the reference case 308 U.S. 271, the Court emphasized that just compensation is the value at the time of taking, asserting that unless a specific statutory provision fixes the time of taking, the actual event that triggered the taking must be considered for assessing value. This is pertinent to the present case where the defense, led by Mr. Badley, disputes the timings and statements allegedly made by the representatives of both parties during the jury's visit to the premises.

Similarly, in reference case 98 F.2d 609, the Court concluded that an option agreement’s terms remain enforceable in condemnation suits even if certain stipulated timelines are exceeded due to necessary legal proceedings. In the current case, the negotiations between the plaintiff's representatives and Mr. Badley, including letters and proposed judgments, imply ongoing discussions up until the trial, negating claims of a conclusive accord and satisfaction at a proposed amount. 

Finally, reference case 140 F.2d 941 sheds light on the implications of delays and cancellations in property transaction agreements, noting that unreasonable delays can lead to the negation of binding agreements about land value. The defendant in the present case’s contention that ongoing negotiations thwarted a finalized agreement aligns with this precedent, asserting that no binding accord existed before the jury's verdict.

These references collectively support the position that the jury's award of $15,000 was justified based on the evidence presented regarding the property's condition and value at the time of taking, judged fairly within legal precedents.

gold_text: The court does not think that the parties reached any agreement as to the amount that should be paid for just compensation, and certainly the plaintiff did not feel that a valid agreement had been entered into, else it would have filed an amendment to the declaration of taking and the complaint and alleged that an agreement fixing just compensation had been entered into. Such procedure is recognized and has been approved. See, Danforth v. United States, 308 U.S. 271, 60 S.Ct. 231, 84 L.Ed. 240; Wachovia Bank & Trust Co., v. United States, 4 Cir., 1938, 98 F.2d 609; United Statev. Stott, 8 Cir., 1944, 140 F.2d 941.
