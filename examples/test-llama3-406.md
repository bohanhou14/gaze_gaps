You are referring to a series of legal cases that involve issues of discrimination and peremptory strikes in jury selection. The cases include Reference case 162 F.3d 481, which involved a challenge to the prosecutor's use of peremptory strikes to exclude African-American jurors, and Reference case 368 F.3d 246, which involved a similar challenge in a case where the prosecutor used peremptory strikes to exclude all seven African-American members of the jury venire.

In both cases, the courts held that the prosecutor's use of peremptory strikes was not discriminatory, despite the fact that the prosecutor had used the strikes to exclude a disproportionate number of African-American jurors. The courts based their decisions on the fact that the prosecutor had provided race-neutral explanations for the strikes, and that the strikes were not motivated by the prosecutor's own racial bias.

Reference case 476 F.3d 426 involved a challenge to the prosecutor's use of peremptory strikes in a case where the prosecutor had used the strikes to exclude all the African-American members of the jury venire. The court held that the prosecutor's use of peremptory strikes was not discriminatory, despite the fact that the prosecutor had used the strikes to exclude a disproportionate number of African-American jurors. The court based its decision on the fact that the prosecutor had provided race-neutral explanations for the strikes, and that the strikes were not motivated by the prosecutor's own racial bias.

Reference case 375 F.3d 643 involved a challenge to the prosecutor's use of peremptory strikes in a case where the prosecutor had used the strikes to exclude all the African-American members of the jury venire.

The court based its decision on the fact that the prosecutor had provided race-neutral explanations for the strikes, and that the strikes were not motivated by the prosecutor's own racial bias.

In all of these cases, the courts have held that the prosecutor's use of peremptory strikes was not discriminatory, despite the fact that the prosecutor had used the strikes to exclude a disproportionate number of African-American jurors. The courts have based their decisions on the fact that the prosecutor had provided race-neutral explanations for the strikes, and that the strikes were not motivated by the prosecutor's own racial bias.

gold_text: Court of Illinois to affirm the trial court’s conclusion that the peremptory strikes were not motivated by race. The trial court was permitted to conclude that the strikes were race neutral based on (1) the circumstantial evidence culled from the voir dire transcript supporting the state’s race-neutral justifications for the strikes; and (2) the prosecutor’s description of his general practices in jury selection. See Morse v. Hanks, 172 F.3d 983, 984-85 & 985 n. 1 (7th Cir.1999); Mahaffey v. Page, 162 F.3d 481, 484 n. 1 (7th Cir.1998); cf Hardcastle v. Horn, 368 F.3d 246, 256-57 & 257 n. 4 (3d Cir.2004) (“ ‘[W]e are unprepared to hold ... that the state’s burden can never be carried without direct evidence from the decisionmaking prosecutor regarding his or her state of mind.’ ” (citations omitted)). This conclusion is “ ‘a pure issue of fact’ accorded significant deference,” Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 364, 111 S.Ct. 1859, and presumed correct unless Boston shows by clear and convincing evidence that it is not, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1); Rice, 546 U.S. at 338-39, 126 S.Ct. 969; Lamon, 467 F.3d at 1102; see also Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 n. 21, 106 S.Ct. 1712. Boston points to no such evidence, either in his § 2254 petition or his submissions to this court. Rather, he merely asserts—without elaboration—that the prosecution challenged the six prospective jurors because of their race; such a conclusory declaration alone is insufficient to establish on collateral attack a constitutional violation. See Rice, 546 U.S. at 338-39, 126 S.Ct. 969; Purkett, 514 U.S. at 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769 (per curiam); see also Daniels v. Knight, 476 F.3d 426, 434 (7th Cir.2007); Conner v. McBride, 375 F.3d 643, 652 (7th Cir.2004).
