In Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Travelers Insurance Co., 7 Cir., 1958, 261 F.2d 774, the Court indicated that the duty to defend must be based on the allegations within the complaint, regardless of whether those allegations are conclusively determined as groundless or false. This is consistent with the approach taken in Lee v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 2 Cir., 178 F.2d 750, where it was held that the insurer’s obligation to defend arises if the complaint alleges facts which potentially fall within the policy coverage.

Additionally, in the case of Powell Plumbing Heating, Inc. v. Merchants Mutual Casualty Co., referred to within 178 F.2d 750, the principle was reaffirmed that ambiguities in policy language should be construed in favor of the insured to impose the defense burden on the insurer.

In a similar vein, 194 F.2d 284 echoes this by suggesting that the insurer must defend until it can definitively confine the claims outside the policy’s coverage. Even if the allegations in the state court complaint are insufficient without additional information, Liberty Mutual is still obliged to defend Sears in the underlying state court action.

Furthermore, 175 F.2d 597 enhances this premise by underscoring that an insurer’s duty to defend exists as long as the allegations in the complaint reasonably hint at potential coverage, regardless of the complaint's precision or perfection.

Therefore, taking these cases into account, it is evident that Liberty Mutual's obligation to defend Sears in the Circuit Court suit is activated by the allegations implicating Power Products' negligence, and until it is unequivocally established that the claims are not covered by the policy, Liberty Mutual must fulfill its defense commitment.
