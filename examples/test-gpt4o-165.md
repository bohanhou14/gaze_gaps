Reviewing the legal standard for acting under "color of state law," it is crucial to examine the circumstances surrounding Hogan’s actions. In Chapman v. Higbee Co., 319 F.3d 825 (6th Cir.2003), the court determined that a security officer could be seen as acting under color of state law when actions, like initiating a strip search, could be attributed to state authority. Similarly, the presence of Hogan in a courthouse, engaging in actions while ostensibly performing official duties, raises the issue of whether his actions were state-sanctioned.

Additionally, the policies referenced in Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, highlight the significant powers and responsibilities bestowed upon entities by the state, influencing whether actions taken under such circumstances can be deemed state actions. Thought must be given to whether Hogan’s response to Barkovic in a courthouse setting, while on duty and discussing official matters, constitutes an exercise under the authority granted by his state position. Therefore, as there is a genuine dispute over whether Hogan’s conduct falls under the color of state law, the district court’s summary judgment decision needs reevaluation.

In conclusion, consistent with precedent in Chapman v. Higbee Co., this case presents factual conflicts that necessitate a jury’s determination on Hogan’s state-actor status at the moment of the altercation with Barkovic. Thus, we reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings aligned with this opinion.

gold_text: Chapman v. Higbee Co. presented a genuine issue of material fact as to wheth er a security officer acted under color of state law. 319 F.3d 825, 835 (6th Cir.2003). In Chapman, a Dillard’s security guard, who was an off-duty sheriffs deputy, wearing his official uniform, badge, and sidearm, stopped and searched the plaintiff. Id. at 834. The officer did not represent himself as a police officer or threaten to arrest the plaintiff, but he did initiate a strip search, which, according to Dillard’s policy, required the intervention of police. Id. at 835. Thus, this court, describing the “color of state law” inquiry as “fact-specific” and determined on “a case-by-case basis,” held that “a reasonable jury could very well find that the initiation of a strip search by an armed, uniformed sheriffs deputy constituted an act that may fairly be attributed to the state.” Id. at 834-35 (citing Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961)). In turn, this court determined that summary judgment was inappropriate and remanded the case. Id. at 835.
