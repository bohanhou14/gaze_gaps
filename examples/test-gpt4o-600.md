**Generation:**

Based on the above findings and legal precedents, particularly the case of *Wallis v. Justice Oaks II, Ltd.* (898 F.2d 1544), the doctrine of res judicata clearly bars GMAC from relitigating the interest issue at this stage. As reaffirmed in Justice Oaks II, the confirmation order of a bankruptcy plan is considered final and conclusive. Since GMAC did not object to the confirmation of the debtor's plan, which explicitly stated a 0.00% interest rate, they are now precluded from claiming any post-petition interest.

Moreover, as discussed under Judge Tjoflat's ruling, the prerequisites for res judicata are met: the court had proper jurisdiction, the confirmation order was a final judgment, the same parties are involved, and the same claims were or could have been addressed in the initial proceeding (*898 F.2d 1544*). GMAC’s failure to timely assert their claim for interest and subsequent acceptance of the payment terms further supports the waiver of their right to claim additional interest.

Consequently, GMAC’s amended claim seeking post-petition interest is disallowed, respecting both the res judicata effect of the confirmation order and the principle of waiver as discussed in *In re Garfinkle*.

Therefore, it is ORDERED that:

1. The debtor’s Objection to General Motors Acceptance Corporation’s Amended Proof of Claim (Claim No. 3) is SUSTAINED;
2. The Amended Proof of Claim (Claim No. 3) is DISALLOWED.
