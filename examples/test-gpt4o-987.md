This prediction stems from multiple jurisdictions that have addressed similar issues. For example, the Pennsylvania courts have considered the single publication rule as applicable to the Internet based on analogous reasoning observed in other jurisdictions (Reference case 690 F.3d 161). This standpoint is bolstered by the Firth v. State, 706 N.Y.S.2d 835, 843 (N.Y.O. Cl.2000), aff'd 98 N.Y.2d 365, 747 N.Y.S.2d 69, 775 N.E.2d 463 (App.2002), which argued the lack of rational basis to distinguish between traditional print and electronic publication. Subsequent cases such as Nationwide Bi-Weekly Admin., Inc. v. Belo Corp., 512 F.3d 137, 144 (5th Cir.2007) and Oja v. U.S. Army Corps of Engâ€™rs, 440 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.2006) have upheld this view, affirming the single publication rule's applicability to Internet content. 

An exception to this rule, known as the republication doctrine, resets the statute of limitations if defamatory material is edited and reissued or placed in a new form, as outlined in Davis v. Mitan (In re Davis), 347 B.R. 607, 611 (W.D.Ky.2006). However, courts typically distinguish between mere technical changes and actual republication, providing a nuanced approach to Internet modifications (Reference case 690 F.3d 161). Therefore, Pippen's assertion that ongoing online availability constitutes republication is unlikely to succeed under the established legal precedents.

Nestle USA, Inc., 47 Cal.4th 468, 97 Cal.Rptr.3d 798, 213 P.3d 132 (2009); T.S. v. Plain Dealer, 194 Ohio App.3d 30, 954 N.E.2d 213 (2011); Ladd v.

State, 378 N.J.Super. 471, 876 A.2d 311 (2005); Firth v. State, 98 N.Y.2d 365, 747 N.Y.S.2d 69, 775 N.E.2d 463 (2002). And those federal courts that have addressed the topic have concluded that the relevant state supreme court would agree. See Shepard v. The-HuffingtonPost.com, Inc., 509 Fed.Appx. 556 (8th Cir.2013) (Minnesota law) (non-precedential); In re Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC, 690 F.3d 161, 174-75 (3d Cir.2012) (Pennsylvania law). Pippen does not alert us to any authority supporting his view, and we have found none.
