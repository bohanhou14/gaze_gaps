In evaluating Willard’s claims, it is vital to note that the duty to make reasonable accommodations for handicapped employees, as mandated under the Rehabilitation Act, imposes an affirmative obligation on federal employers (857 F.2d 1073). The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that reasonable accommodation is possible (755 F.2d 1244). In this case, Willard failed to meet this burden as she could not identify a vacant, funded position to which she could have been reassigned, which is a critical element of her prima facie case (107 F.3d 1171). 

Moreover, the court’s application of summary judgment standards involves verifying that no material factual disputes necessitate a trial (Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317). Despite Willard’s arguments regarding the Postal Service’s duty to engage in an interactive process, this Court has clarified that even a failure to engage in such a process does not negate the plaintiff’s obligation to identify a suitable vacant position after discovery (Donahue v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 224 F.3d 226, 234). Thus, Willard’s inability to identify an appropriate position substantiates the summary judgment in favor of the defendant, rendering her claims insufficient to proceed to trial (658 F.2d 1372).

gold_text: Willard’s final contention is that summary judgment was improper because the defendant had not satisfied its burden of proving that the requested accommodation was unreasonable. For this argument, she relies on the statement in Hall v. United States Postal Service, 857 F.2d 1073 (6th Cir.1988), that “[t]he burden is on the employer to present credible evidence that a reasonable accommodation is not possible in a particular situation.” Id. at 1080 (citations omitted). Hall is distinguishable because there is no “particular situation” for the employer to address here since Willard has not identified any vacant, funded positions that she was qualified to perform. In Hall, the court was faced with the question of whether a reasonable accommodation would enable the plaintiff to perform the functions of an already identified position; it was not presented with the threshold issue of the need to identify a position in the first place. Such identification is part of a plaintiffs prima facie case, and the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case before she can prevail on a claim of disability discrimination. See Gaines v. Runyon, 107 F.3d 1171, 1175 (6th Cir.1997). Once that has happened, “the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the employee cannot reasonably be accommodated.... ” Id. If, however, “the plaintiff fails to establish a ptima facie case, it is unnecessary to address the question of reasonable accommodation.” Id. at 1176 (citing Jasany v. U.S. Postal Serv., 755 F.2d 1244, 1250 (6th Cir.1985); Sisson v. Helms, 751 F.2d 991, 993 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 846, 106 S.Ct. 137, 88 L.Ed.2d 113 (1985); Daubert v. U.S. Postal Serv., 733 F.2d 1367 (10th Cir.1984); Pushkin v. Regents of Univ. of Colo., 658 F.2d 1372, 1387 (10th Cir.1981)). Because Willard has not established a prima facie case, the defendant was never eonfi’onted with the burden of demonstrating that the proposed accommodation was not reasonable. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot survive summary judgment on the basis that the defendant did not meet that burden.
