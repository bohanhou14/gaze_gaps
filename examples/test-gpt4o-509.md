**Generation:**

As emphasized in *United Stationers Supply Co. v. King*, "a conclusory assertion that a document is privileged is inadequate" (see 2013 WL 419346, at *2). Similarly, Ford's use of vague and repetitive descriptions fails to meet the requisite standard established by *Victor Stanley, Inc. v. Creative Pipe, Inc.*, which mandates that the privilege log must provide sufficient facts to allow an assessment of the validity of the privilege claim (see 250 F.R.D. 251, 264).

The Court's ruling in *Spilker v. Medtronic, Inc.*, which upheld privilege logs that detailed attorney-client communications with specific contextual information, underscores the deficiencies in Ford's log (see No. 4:13-CV-76-H, 2015 WL 1643258, at *6). Ford's descriptions lack comparable specificity, rendering the log insufficient under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5)(A).

Additionally, as illustrated in *R.J. Reynolds Tobacco v. Philip Morris, Inc.*, privilege logs that merely list generic descriptions without factual context are deemed inadequate (see 29 Fed.Appx. 880, 882). Ford's privilege log, characterized by non-descriptive file names and uniform language, similarly does not provide the necessary detail, as shown by Mr. Ott's inability to identify his own documents from the log (see ECF No. 536-8 at 4-5).

Considering the guidance from these precedents and the lack of sufficient information within Ford's supplemental privilege log, the Court concludes that Ford must provide a more detailed log to substantiate its claims of privilege. This ensures compliance with Rule 26(b)(5)(A) and allows Plaintiffs to intelligently determine the appropriateness of the asserted privileges.

gold_text: Moreover, as Plaintiffs point out, many of the withheld documents were created by non-attorneys within Ford’s ASO, and then sent to attorneys within Ford’s OGC. Mr. Ott testified to his belief that he and his team were assigned to perform the 2010 investigation into unintended acceleration as part of the normal course of Ford’s business. (ECF No. 569-1 at 5); see Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co., 967 F.2d 980, 984 (4th Cir.1992) (noting that materials prepared in ordinary course of business “are not documents prepared in anticipation of litigation”); Johnson v. Ford Motor Co., No. 3:13-cv-06529, 2015 WL 1650428, at *4 (S.D.W.Va. Apr. 14, 2015) (recognizing that, under both West Virginia and Michigan law, not all communications between attorney and client are privileged, only those made for purpose of obtaining legal advice); Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd, 306 F.R.D. 234 (N.D.Cal. 2015) (noting that simply because an attorney is involved in a communication does not make the communication privileged, nor does a single email of a legal nature “privilege the entire email thread.”). Obviously then, reasonable questions exist as to Ford’s claims of attorney-client privilege and work-product protection in light of the plain facial inadequacy of the privilege log and Mr. Ott’s testimony. Ford should have recognized these issues and answered them with a more detailed privilege log or some type of extrinsic evidence further explaining the basis for withholding the listed ASO documents before Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to compel. Even now, Mr. Logel’s affidavit does not entirely quell Plaintiffs’ reasonable skepticism as to the nondisclosure of some of the listed documents; particularly, in light of Mr. Ott’s testimony. Therefore, after having reviewed the May 2015 supplemental ASO privilege log, the Court FINDS that the log’s document descriptions do not enable Plaintiffs “to make an intelligent determination about the validity of the assertion of the privilege” and thus are insufficient. Auto. Club of N.Y., Inc., 2014 WL 2518959, at *5.
