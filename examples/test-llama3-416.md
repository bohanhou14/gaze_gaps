In the case of Capital City Telephone Company v. Communication Workers of America, the court was faced with the issue of whether the company could seek compensatory damages for the breach of the "no strike" provision of the collective bargaining agreement. The company argued that the district court erred in deferring the issue of damages to arbitration, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Williams v. Pacific Maritime Ass'n, 421 F.2d 1287 (9th Cir. 1970), which held that a party seeking damages for a breach of contract must submit the dispute to arbitration.

However, the court held that the arbitration clause in the collective bargaining agreement was susceptible to an interpretation that covered the asserted dispute, and therefore, the company was bound by the arbitration award. The court cited Local 127, United Shoe Workers of America v. Brooks Shoe Manufacturing Co., 298 F.2d 277 (3rd Cir. 1962) (en banc), which established the principle that a grievance under a collective bargaining agreement is deemed arbitrable unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.

Furthermore, the court noted that the company had previously agreed to submit all disputes to arbitration, citing the stipulation filed on April 19, 1974, which provided that the parties had agreed to submit the remaining issues to arbitration consistent with the arbitration procedure set forth in the collective bargaining agreement. This stipulation, along with Capital's previous filings, precluded the court from saying with positive assurance that the arbitration clause was not susceptible of an interpretation that covered the asserted dispute.

In conclusion, the court held that the company was bound by the arbitration award and could not seek compensatory damages for the breach of the "no strike" provision. The court's decision was based on the interpretation of the arbitration clause in the collective bargaining agreement and the company's previous agreement to submit all disputes to arbitration. This case is consistent with the principles established in cases such as Zamora v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc., 336 F.Supp. 588 (S.D.Iowa 1972), and Sidney Wanzer & Sons, Inc. v. Milk Drivers Union, Local 753, supra.

gold_text: Capital argues that this stipulation was merely a means of informing the district court that the parties were proceeding on the course already ordered by the court. However, our reading of the stipulation convinces us otherwise. We find no language used in the stipulation to indicate that Capital was proceeding to arbitration on the damage issue under protest or solely because the court had so ordered. In clear, unambiguous language the stipulation states that “the parties have agreed to submit the remaining issues to arbitration.” In similar fashion, Capital and the defendants stated to the district court in a filing entitled “Suggestions in Support of Motion for Order Extending Date for Completion of Discovery” that “[t]he parties propose to now submit the remaining issues [damages] to the same arbitrator at a time and place consistent with the convenience of said arbitrator.” Assuming arguendo that the original collective bargaining agreement did not provide for arbitration of the damage issue, we are persuaded that the parties nevertheless independently agreed to submit this issue to arbitration.
