Drawing parallels to the reference cases, plaintiffs argue that Ease's authority as a fiduciary was inadequately substantiated. Referencing case 587 F.2d 453, fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA require clear designation and proper delegation. Section 3(21)(A) of ERISA stipulates that a fiduciary must have discretionary authority or control over plan management, or the rendering of investment advice for compensation, among other responsibilities. Here, while it is evident that some form of delegation occurred, the absence of a written record raises questions regarding procedural fidelity and adherence to fiduciary designation requirements.

Similarly, in reference case 88 F.R.D. 153, the court emphasized that conclusory identification of fiduciaries without supportive facts fails to assert ERISA duties properly. Thus, the contention is whether verbal delegations supported by testimonies without written documentation fulfill ERISA’s stringent fiduciary definition and delegation criteria.

Despite these concerns, the district court concluded plaintiffs did not satisfy their burden to prove that the delegation was improper. Consequently, Ease acted within his delegated authority under section 2.9.2., qualifying as a fiduciary based on ERISA's broad definition encompassing those exercising discretionary responsibilities. 

In conclusion, plaintiffs’ arguments draw valid inquiries into procedural rigor and fiduciary designation, yet fell short under judicial scrutiny to establish a deviation from the arbitrary and capricious standard of review. The district court’s affirmation of Ease’s decision aligns with judicial precedents on fiduciary duty delineation and delegation protocols as observed in 587 F.2d 453 and 88 F.R.D. 153.

Thus whatever his title, or whether he was named as a fiduciary or not, Ease was acting as a fiduciary when making his no severance pay determination. •
