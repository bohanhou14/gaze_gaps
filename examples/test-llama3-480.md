The Court has carefully reviewed the evidence presented at trial and concludes that the prosecution has met its burden of proving petitioner's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence shows that petitioner intentionally pointed the gun at the victim and pulled the trigger, resulting in the victim's death. The jury instruction on accidental homicide was adequate and informed the jury of petitioner's defense.

Petitioner's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are without merit. Defense counsel's decision not to object to the jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter was a reasonable trial strategy. The evidence did not warrant an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, and an instruction on an intentional crime would have contradicted petitioner's theory of accident.

Petitioner's allegations of prosecutorial misconduct are also unfounded. The prosecutor's comments during closing argument were fair and did not mislead the jury. The prosecution did not suppress material evidence, and the trial court's error regarding accidental homicide was promptly corrected.

In conclusion, the Court finds that petitioner's conviction for murder in the second degree is supported by sufficient evidence, and the trial was fair and impartial. Petitioner's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and insufficient evidence are without merit. As such, the petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.
