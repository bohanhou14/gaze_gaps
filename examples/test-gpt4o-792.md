Furthermore, appellant contends that the admission of evidence of prior acts of a similar nature was in error. However, established precedents underscore that in prosecutions for sexual offenses, evidence of prior similar acts is admissible to demonstrate a disposition to commit the act charged. In Miller v. United States, 126 F.2d 849, it was held that evidence of prior acts between the same parties is permissible as it indicates a continued emotional predisposition. Similarly, United States v. Regents of New Mexico School of Mines, 142 F.2d 85, denotes that such evidence shows a likelihood that the emotional predisposition will persist, making it relevant and material to the case at hand. 

Additionally, in addressing appellantâ€™s assertion that the jury should have been allowed to view the premises, it is clear from precedent that such a decision is at the court's discretion. As elucidated in 299 F. 893, the trial court's refusal does not constitute an abuse of discretion unless it is shown to lack precedent or reason.

Therefore, considering these principles and precedents, the court did not err in the evidentiary rulings in question, nor in exercising its discretion regarding the jury's viewing of the premises.

United States, 1924, 55 App.D.C. 26, 299 F. 893; see, also, Bracey v. United States, 1944, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 23, 142 F.2d 85, certiorari denied 322 U.S. 762, 64 S.Ct. 1274, 88 L.Ed. 1589. This exception to the general rule excluding evidence of a crime for which a defendant is not on trial is qualified. Kidwell v. United States, 1912, 38 App.D.C. 566, 574. The qualification is that there must be independent evidence which points to the defendant as having committed the offense charged. As we have seen, this requirement is met in this case.
