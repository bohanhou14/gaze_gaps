MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER
ROBINSON, District Judge.

II. ANALYSIS:

A. Motion to Dismiss:

1. Pendent Jurisdiction:

The Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs’ claim under New York Civil Rights Law 50-b may also be considered. In Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966), the Supreme Court established the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, which allows federal courts to hear state-law claims when the federal claims are also part of the same case. Here, the Plaintiffs seek to bring a claim under New York Civil Rights Law 50-b, which provides a private right of action for the violation of certain constitutional and statutory rights. In order to maintain a claim under this statute, the Plaintiffs must show that the Defendants’ actions deprived them of a right or privilege guaranteed by the New York Civil Rights Law.

In this case, the Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants’ disclosure of the Student’s sexual abuse history violated his right to privacy under New York Civil Rights Law 50-b. However, the Defendants argue that this claim lacks merit because the statute does not provide a private right of action for the violation of the right to privacy. They also argue that even if the statute did provide a private right of action, the Court lacks pendent jurisdiction over the state-law claim because the federal claims have been dismissed.

In 484 U.S. 343, the Supreme Court held that a federal court has the discretion to decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over a state-law claim when the federal claims have been dismissed. Here, the federal claims under § 1983 have been dismissed, and the Court has determined that the Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Therefore, the Court declines to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the state-law claim under New York Civil Rights Law 50-b. The Plaintiffs’ claim under New York Civil Rights Law 50-b is hereby dismissed without prejudice.

gold_text: In addition to alleging a violation of the Student’s constitutional privacy rights, the Plaintiffs also claim a violation of the Student’s right to privacy under § 50-b of the New York Civil Rights Law. Under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, where the state and federal claims derive from a common nucleus of operative fact such that it would ordinarily be expected that they would all be tried in one judicial proceeding, federal courts have the constitutional power to exercise jurisdiction of the state law claims as well as the federal claims. See e.g. United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). However, 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) gives a district court the discretion not to exercise pendent jurisdiction when it has dismissed all of the claims over which it had original jurisdiction. Further, the Supreme Court in Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988), announced that when all federal claims are eliminated in the early stages of litigation, the balance of factors generally favors declining to exercise pendent jurisdiction over remaining state law claims and dismissing them without prejudice. Id. at 350, 108 S.Ct. 614. Therefore, in light of the determination that the Plaintiffs’ have not stated a viable federal claim under 1983, this Court declines to exercise jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs’ § 50-b claim. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs’ second cause of action is hereby dismissed without prejudice.
