The Holmans argue that their Title VII claims should survive the 12(b)(6) motion on the basis that they could prove a set of facts consistent with their complaint. However, it is well established that a plaintiff can plead themselves out of court by alleging facts that negate their claim. See Trevino v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 916 F.2d 1230, 1234 (7th Cir.1990) and Warzon v. Drew, No. 94-2687, 1995 WL 422847 (7th Cir. July 19, 1995). The allegations here clearly articulate an "equal opportunity" harasser, which falls outside Title VII as it does not demonstrate discrimination based on sex. Additionally, conclusory legal statements are insufficient to defeat a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, as noted in Nelson v. Monroe Regional Med. Ctr., 925 F.2d 1555, 1559 (7th Cir.1991).

Regarding the pleading standards, it is paramount to submit non-legalistic statements that outline the claims clearly and cogently as per federal rules, avoiding unnecessary details that can undermine the case, as established in Trevino, 916 F.2d at 1230, 1234, and also reiterating the vital principle from 69 F.3d 123, that we must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.

In conclusion, the district court's dismissal of the Holmans' sexual harassment claims was appropriate since the complaint's facts do not establish sex-based discrimination under Title VII, leaving other claims intact for further litigation.

gold_text: Additional discovery, then, would not save the Holmans’ sexual harassment claims. Their problem is that the allegations in their complaint are very precise; the complaint simply and clearly says that their supervisor was sexually harassing each of them by asking for sexual favors. As a matter of law, then, neither of them has a claim for discrimination under Title VII. Northern Trust Co. v. Peters, 69 F.3d 123, 129 (7th Cir.1995) (“More is not necessarily better under the Federal Rules; a party ‘can plead himself out of court by ... alleging facts which ... demonstrate that he has no legal claim.’ ”) (quoting Trevino v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., 916 F.2d 1230, 1234 (7th Cir.1990)).
