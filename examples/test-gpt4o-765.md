The issue before us under Charge IV necessitates the analysis of whether the law officer erred by not instructing on the elements of lesser included offenses. The precedent established in United States v. Clark, 2 USCMA 306, highlights the importance of providing adequate instructions regarding lesser offenses when evidence may reasonably support a finding of a lesser included offense. In Clark, the failure to instruct on voluntary manslaughter when evidence indicated heat of passion constituted prejudicial error.

Similarly, in United States v. Gilbertson, 4 CMR 57, and United States v. Strong, 5 CMR 55, the courts emphasized that instructional deficiencies regarding lesser offenses could not be rectified merely by referencing appropriate manual provisions.

Applying these principles to the present case, the law officer's failure to instruct on the elements of lesser offenses under Charge IV amounts to a significant legal oversight. As established in United States v. Moreash, 5 CMR, such an omission requires corrective action due to its potential prejudice to the accused's substantial rights. The fact that the court-martial and the board of review ultimately convicted the accused of lesser included offenses for specifications 1 through 6 further underscores the necessity for proper instructions.

Therefore, the failure of the law officer to instruct on these lesser included offenses indeed constitutes prejudicial error, as it deprived the accused of a fair opportunity for the court members to consider the appropriate lesser charges. Based on the precedents and consistent with the requirement of military due process, as discussed in United States v. Clay, 1 USCMA 74, 1 CMR 74 and United States v. Snyder, 1 USCMA 423, 4 CMR 15, the convictions under specifications 5 and 6 should align with those under specifications 1 through 4, thus warranting reconsideration.

gold_text: Did the failure of the law officer to instruct on the elements of' the lesser offenses constitute error? We have — on occasions without number — held that instructions as to lesser offenses need be given only where the lesser offense or offenses are fairly raised by the evidence adduced at the trial as reasonable alternatives to that charged. United States v. Miller, 2 USCMA 194, 7 CMR 70. In this case, from the factual conclusions of the court-martial and the board of review to the effect that accused had possessed no intention to deceive and no intention at the time of issuance not to maintain a sufficient balance in'his account, it seems clear beyond peradventure that the lesser offenses not involving those elements, and of which accused now stands convicted, were fairly raised as reasonable alternatives to those charged. Indeed, we hold that they were. The law officer’s dereliction was, therefore, error. However, since the lesser offenses of which the accused stands convicted were the only alternatives raised to the offenses charged, whatever prejudice resulted to the accused from the law officer’s instructional omissions in this particular, has been removed by the action of the court-martial and the board of review. United States v. Baguex, 2 USCMA 306, 8 CMR 106; see United States v. Simmons, supra. The present case is not, we believe, within the principle of United States v. Clark, 1 USCMA 201, 2 CMR 107.
