In addition, Fragchem’s reliance on the expired arbitration clause is misplaced given the context of the post-termination agreements. Referencing case 307 F.3d 601, the presumption of arbitrability does not fully apply when arbitration agreements are contained in expired contracts. The court must determine whether the parties had an ongoing agreement to arbitrate disputes post-expiration (Litton Financial Printing Division v. NLRB, 501 U.S. 190). Similarly, in the current case, whether Fragchem and CPL continued their relationship under the original Supply Agreement or through new terms, the applicability of the arbitration clause is crucial.

Furthermore, case 486 F.3d 989 underscores the scrutiny required when delineating the scope of arbitration clauses, especially when agreements have expired. The district court in that case found that an arbitration agreement had expired and did not govern the parties' relationship, reinforcing that expired agreements necessitate clear evidence of continued applicability.

Given CPL’s assertion that post-termination dealings lacked the arbitration clause and the district court’s procedural misstep in dismissing sua sponte (Automobile Mechanics, 502 F.3d 740; case 356 F.3d 731), we find that a thorough examination of the post-termination contractual framework is warranted. Consequently, we reverse the district court’s dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Lastly, case 330 F.3d 991 emphasizes that decisions on summary judgment, especially involving complex contractual disputes, are best left to district courts for comprehensive evaluation. Thus, this matter necessitates further deliberation at the lower court level to resolve the contractual ambiguities and the applicability of the arbitration clause post-expiration.

gold_text: Because the district court dismissed the case sua sponte for improper venue based on the arbitration clause contained in the Supply Agreement, it did not address the key issue here of whether the parties are still bound by the agreement. On appeal, both parties agree that the Supply Agreement terminated two years before the sale at issue in this lawsuit. However, Fragchem argues that Kirit Parikh’s letter dated June 3, 2002, coupled with Cadila/CPL’s continued manufacture and sale of C Products, indicates that the Supply Agreement was still in full force. CPL, however, relies on this Court’s twin decisions in Nissan North America, Inc. v. Jim M’Lady Oldsmobile, Inc., 307 F.3d 601 (7th Cir.2002), and Nissan North America, Inc. v. Jim M’Lady Oldsmobile, Inc., 486 F.3d 989 (7th Cir.2007), for the proposition that an agreement to arbitrate does not survive if the written agreement between two parties expired, and there was no subsequent written agreement governing the parties’ relationship that contained an arbitration clause. While there are questions of law here, there are also questions of fact, and so the issue of whether the Supply Agreement covered the April 2004 transaction is better left to the district court as a matter of first impression. See International Financial Services Corp. v. Chromas Technologies Canada, Inc., 356 F.3d 731, 740 (“Whether veil-piercing is appropriate depends on a host of considerations that this court is ill-positioned to weigh as a matter of first impression.”); Turner v. J. V.D.B. Assocs., Inc., 330 F.3d 991, 998 (7th Cir.2003) (refusing to direct the entry of summary judgment in favor of one party when the district court had not yet made a ruling on the issue, in part because of the state of the record). What we have ruled here is that it was improper for the district court to dismiss the lawsuit sua sponte on the grounds of improper venue based on an arbitration agreement between the parties when neither party explicitly or effectively indicated that it would not waive arbitration. Nevertheless, even if on remand one of the parties moves to compel arbitration, the district court will still have to grapple with the question of whether the Supply Agreement applies to the transaction at issue.
