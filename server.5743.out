Now, you are asked to annotate legal analysis generated by large language models and classify the errors and mismatch made by these models. To produce these legal analysis, a language model will receive the following prompt:\n\nHere are some reference articles for legal cases: \n# Reference case {case_key_1}\n{text of cited case 1} \n# Reference case {case_key_2}\n{text of cited case 2}\n...\n# Reference case {case_key_N} {text of cited case N}\nHere is the text I’ve written so far: # Paragrah\n{previous_text}\nContinue to write it following the style of my writeup. Your answer contains 100 to 400 words. You must explicitly use the reference cases and mention their reference ids, i.e. {case_key_1}, {case_key_2} . . . {case_key_N}. Wrap your answer with <answer></answer>. Make your answer concise and avoid redundant languages.\n\nReceiving the prompt above, a language model will generate a paragraph of legal analysis, but often times they make different kinds of errors and mismatches. \n\nThe instructions for you to classify these errors and mismatches are as follows:\n\nYou should classify the LLM-generated legal analysis to these categories:\n\n1. Intrinsic gap:\nThis category refers to generation that is unacceptable, due to the language model has fundamentally failed to follow the instruction, or make a lot of redundancy, or generate something that does not look like legal text (structural mismatch). More specificially, if it makes one or more of the following:\n\n- Redundancy (sentence-level, appearing as neural degeneration): the generation appears to make repetitive statements that do not add more meaning to the analysis. For example, multiple occurences of an exact sentence or phrase.\n- Citation Format Mismatch: the generation appears not matching with the citation format of the standard Bluebook.\n    - Please be aware that, for example, 440 U.S. 48, 55\' is a proper format. Although its full citation should be \'Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979)\', the format \'440 U.S. 48, 55\' is still acceptable as a concise form.\n- Structural Mismatch: the generation appears to generate the document from scratch (like containing words such as "ORDER" which only appear in the beginning).\n- Stylistic Mismatch: contain sentences that do not match the styles of legalese.\n\nIf this type of gaps is present, add the label `1`. Continue to item 2.\n\nSide note: You should be able to classify this purely based on the generation itself, without having to look at cited examples.\n\n2. Target mismatch:\n\nWhile language model\'s generated text may be obviously wrong and substantively different from the target (i.e. the original/target text from the case), the claims it makes are still logically and factually sound and can be seen as acceptable. This could be because\n - Chain Cite: the citations appear in a chain cite but the generation cites them parallely, or the other way around.\n    - Clarification: "The rule that certain acts of a creditor in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding and during the statutory period for filing proof of claim, may give rise to something equivalent to a proof of claim and afford a sufficient basis for allowing an amendment after the statutory period for filing, was recognized and applied in many cases decided before the 1938 amendment of the Bankruptcy Act. See In re Atlantic Gulf & Pacific S. S. Corporation, D.C., 26 F.2d 751; In re Fant, D.C., 21 F.2d 182; Globe Indemnity Co. of Newark, N. J., v. Keeble, 4 Cir., 20 F.2d 84; In re Coleman & Titus Corporation, D.C., 286 F. 303; In re Roeber, 2 Cir., 127 F. 122." would be a chain cite because all of these citations support the previous claim "The rule that certain acts of a creditor in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding and during the statutory period for filing proof of claim, may give rise to something equivalent to a proof of claim and afford a sufficient basis for allowing an amendment after the statutory period for filing, was recognized and applied in many cases decided before the 1938 amendment of the Bankruptcy Act."\n - Reverse Cite: the citations reverse the ruling in each other but the generation cites them parallely, or the other way around.\n - Compound Cite: the citations of different cases are cited together, separated by semicolons, or the other way around.\n \n Although it does not match with the target, it is still considered somewhat acceptable, but we should label it out.\n\n If this type of mismatch is present add the label `2`. Continue to item 3.\n\n3. Citation Mismatch: The language model\'s generated text does not align with the content of the citation it points to. This might be because one or more of the following:\n\n- Claim Hallucination: the claim supported by the citation is not truthful or not related to the context or from cited paragraphs or the previous context. The generated text makes different and possibly (although not necessarily) contradictory claims about one or more citations, which you can check from comparing to the reference case. Or, the generated text attributes information from one citation to a different citation.\n- Retrieval Inaccuracy: the claims supported by the citation is not relevant because the cited paragraph looks irrelevant compared to the target paragraph. \n- Citation Hallucination: the citation is non-existent or pulled from a citation in the cited paragraphs or the previous context, or there misses a citation (the generated text fails to use one of the citations that were given to it).\n\nIf this type of mismatch is **present**, add the label `3` and move on to the next example. If none of the above errors are present, label \'0\'.\n\nHere are some examples for demonstration:\n\nExample 1:\nUser:\n\nGeneration:\n\nIn the context of reopening Miss Fowler’s 1968 claim, relevant precedent supports such a measure due to administrative errors. Specifically, in 514 F.2d 561, the court allowed reopening where evidence revealed a clear error on the face of the record. The similarities with Mrs. Lauritzen\'s case are striking; both involved overlooked evidence and procedural errors. Moreover, 527 F.2d 224 further emphasizes that initial, revised, or reconsidered claims may be reopened if clerical or evident errors are detected.\n\nApplying these principles, we find the Secretary\'s refusal to reopen Miss Fowler’s 1968 claim to be legally unsupported. The evidence demonstrates errors that warrant reconsideration, thus fitting within the regulatory framework as outlined in the reference cases. Consequently, we remand the case to the Secretary for a substantive review of the 1968 claim, ensuring compliance with the established legal standards set forth in the cases of 514 F.2d 561 and 527 F.2d 224.\n\ncitations needed to make: [\'514 F.2d 561\', \'527 F.2d 224\']\n\ntarget_text: 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8) provides that a final decision may be reopened at any time “for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.” As the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said in Lauritzen v. Wein-berger, 514 F.2d 561, 563 (8th Cir. 1975), the question for the Social Security Administration on any claim for reopening is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, or whether there is manifest error in the record. This inquiry, in opting for a flexible approach to the doctrine of res judicata, supports the view expressed by this court in Coulter v. Weinberger, 527 F.2d 224, 228 (3d Cir. 1975):\n\nreference_case_1: 514 F.2d 561\n\njudicial review of the August 1, 1967, final determination necessarily bars judicial review of the Appeals Council’s decisions. Mrs. Lauritzen filed a third application for reinstatement of disability benefits on December 8, 1971. In that application, she contended that she had been continuously disabled since 1964. The application was denied and then referred, on Mrs. Lauritzen’s request, to an administrative law judge for decision. He stated that he assumed the matter had been referred to him pursuant to 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8). That section pro vides that an initial, revised or reconsidered determination may be reopened at any time when [s]uch initial * * * determination * * * is unfavorable, in whole or in part, to the party thereto but only for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination * * * was based. (Emphasis added.) The Social Security Claims Manual defines error on the face of the evidence as follows: * * * An error on the face of the evidence exists where, on the basis of all the evidence in the file on which the determination or decision was based and any evidence of record anywhere in the Administration at the time such determination or decision was made, it is clear that the determination or decision was incorrect. * * * A determination or decision which was reasonable on the basis of the evidence in the file and the statute, regulations, instructions, precedents, etc., existing at\n\nreference_case_2: 527 F.2d 224\n\npart provide: “An initial, revised, or reconsidered determination of the Administration or a decision or ¿Wised decision of an hearing examiner or of the Appeals Council which is otherwise final . . . may be reopened: ****** (c) At any time when: ****** (8) Such initial, revised, or reconsidered determination or decision or revised decision is unfavorable, in whole or in part, to the party thereto but only for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.” 20 C.F.R. § 404.957. Our review of the record reveals such error as would require a reopening of the 1968 claim under the standard set by the regulations. The hearing officers’ pre-occupation with the claimant’s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider all of the applicable regulations and to overlook a number of other significant factors which would have a bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim. Because of the error of the Social Security Administration in 1959, there was no determination at that time as to whether Coulter was disabled. If a finding of disability had been made, Coulter would have become eligible for payment of benefits in 1960 when the Act was amended to eliminate the age requirement. It seems unlikely that he would have secured any employment thereafter in view of his testimony that he worked in 1961 and 1962 only out of dire need despite his pain, disability and need for\n\nprevious_text: OPINION OF THE COURT\nWEIS, Circuit Judge.\nClaimant Merle Fowler is presently disabled by multiple sclerosis. Hampered by the necessity to establish an onset date within her coverage period, she has been unsuccessful in securing disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. Difficulties in proof abound, for the disease is a progressive one, the initial date of disability is seldom easy to determine, and periods of remission are common. And as if these problems were not enough, they were compounded by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare’s loss or destruction of critical records relating to claimant’s first application for benefits. After a thorough review of the case, we conclude the HEW determination that no disability existed on the last day of coverage, June 30, 1966 is not supported by the evidence. Finding adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record, we remand to the Secretary for consideration of Miss Fowler’s request to reopen because of error on the record.\nFrom the early 1950’s on, Miss Fowler worked for various medical schools as a recordkeeper, secretary, and nurse. From 1963 to 1967, she was employed at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. That institution did not participate in the Social Security program and her coverage earned while at other jobs terminated on June 30,1966. Claimant’s testimony before the administrative law judge revealed that it was during her service at U.C.L.A. that she began to encounter increasingly serious and bizarre physical disabilities. These difficulties included: problems in maintaining her balance that were severe enough to attract accusations of being intoxicated or under the influence of drugs; a four-week period during which she had to crawl because of an inability to stand; slurred speech resulting in communication problems with coworkers and patients; difficulty in typing. Miss Fowler was forced to use up all of her vacation time as well as her sick leave because of her illness. Additionally, she often found it necessary to rest over long lunch hours.\nMiss Fowler continued to cling to her employment because she was living alone and was her own sole means of support. In February 1967, her condition was such that she could no longer be retained even by the most sympathetic and understanding employer. At about this time her condition was finally diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. She then went to live with her sister in Florida, and for a period of about a year and a half was both bedridden and mentally disoriented. During this interval, her sister filed a disability claim for her with the Social Security Administration, which was rejected, according to the sister, because the claimant did not have enough quarters of coverage.\nThe claimant enjoyed a period of remission from 1970 to 1973 when she was able to obtain limited employment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but thereafter her disease was again disabling. She filed for disability benefits on March 25, 1974, alleging disability from 1965. After an initial denial, the Secretary referred her case for disability evaluation to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation. That agency, based on information that severe symptoms were observable at some time in 1965 or early 1966, concluded that a closed period of disability was established between December 31, 1965 and February 1, 1970, when remission occurred. The Secretary, however, disallowed the payment of any benefit because the 1974 claim had been filed more than twelve months after the first period of disability had ceased in 1970. See 42 U.S.C. § 416(i)(2)(E). The claimant then requested a hearing, asserting that the 1968 claim filed by her sister had been erroneously denied and should be reopened. On the basis of the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation disability evaluation, claimant believed she was entitled to benefits for the 1965 — 1970 period. The ALJ, however, bypassed the 1968 claim issue altogether, finding instead that there had been no disability before June 30, 1966. The Appeals Council affirmed and the district court ruled there was substantial evidence supporting the Secretary’s decision.\nLooking first to the determination of the onset of disability, we conclude that there is not substantial evidence to support the ALJ’s decision.\nThe claimant’s description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing. She tried desperately to hold her job and exerted extraordinary efforts to cope with her disability. Her case did not rely upon her testimony alone but was supported by several statements from persons familiar with her at that time. A letter from Justine Walker, a coworker, was received into evidence and corroborated Miss Fowler’s account of her difficulties. In addition, the detailed statements of two physicians who were aware of her condition during the period were made part of the record. Dr. Donald A. Adams, her treating physician, stated:\n“[Bjeyond question . . . she had multiple sclerosis dating back probably to 1965 and early 1966.”\nHe said further:\n“were she an employee of mine during late 1965 and early 1966 I would have had no other alternative except to terminate her due to her illness even though the consequences would have been that she would be unable to procure another job.”\nDr. Jack A. Cannon, her employer in 1965, said that she should not have been working at that time.\n“However, in considering what would happen to her if I did recommend that she be terminated, I had to realize that she would be unable to secure another position because of the problems, and that I could not recommend her for other employment based on her mental and physical condition.”\nHer physician at the time of the hearing, Dr. Lawrence D. Ellis, came to a similar opinion after reviewing Miss Fowler’s records. He believed she was unable to engage in substantial gainful employment for a period beginning in late 1965. Moreover, the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation report, which, after careful study, found that disability existed as of December 31, 1965, was totally ignored in the ALJ’s decision. The ALJ did not refer to any of the foregoing evidence, but merely summarized the medical reports relating to the disability period prior to June 30, 1966 as giving “no indication of severe and protracted disability prior to that date.”\nThis conclusory statement misses the mark on several counts. It fails to observe the appropriate legal standard, whether claimant is unable “to engage in any substantial gainful activity,” 42 U.S.C. §§ 416(i)(l), 423(d)(1), and substitutes a far harsher requirement. Additionally, the statement is directly contrary to the evidence submitted by the physicians familiar with claimant’s condition. In fact, it is not supported by any medical opinion in this case. As we commented in Gober v. Matthews, 574 F.2d 772, 777 (3d Cir. 1978), an ALJ is not free to set his own expertise against that of physicians who present competent medical evidence.\nThe ALJ’s opinion drew some unsupported inferences from the fact that claimant had been employed by physicians. The ALJ commented, “it is axiomatic that physicians take care of their own.” The thrust of this remark is somewhat obscure because the record indicates the employers did take care of claimant by retaining her for a longer period than that which could be justified by her failing health. To that extent, the “axiom” tends to support Miss Fowler’s claim that she continued to work even though physically incapable of performing the tasks demanded of her. Moreover, her employment after the cut-off date does not foreclose an award of benefits since disability “turns on whether she was disabled within the meaning of the Act notwithstanding the fact that she actually did work.” Stark v. Weinberger, 497 F.2d 1092, 1100 (7th Cir. 1974).\nWe find it particularly puzzling that the ALJ ignored the findings on disability reached by the state agency to which the Secretary had referred the matter. That expert body made a determination of disability on less evidence than was submitted to the ALJ. Although findings by other agencies are not binding on the Secretary, they are entitled to weight and must be considered. We said in an early case that the evaluation of disability by the Veterans Administration was critically relevant and material in a parallel Social Security ease. Pulaski v. Finch, 415 F.2d 613, 618 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Cutler v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir. 1975); DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92,101 (5th Cir. 1972). And in a case quite similar to the one at bar, Dunbar v. Califano, 454 F.Supp. 1261 (W.D.N.Y.1978), the court expressed disapproval over an ALJ’s failure to consider the disability finding of a state agency consulted by the Secretary.\nAfter careful review of the record, we are convinced that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period, and the Secretary’s determination to the contrary cannot stand. Indeed, absent the question of timely filing, we would enter judgment for the plaintiff at this point.\nWe must now, then, consider the effect of the 1968 claim. The 1974 application would not be timely if it constituted the original claim because it was filed more than twelve months after the closed disability period terminated in 1970. The claimant, however, asked that the 1974 claim be considered as one requesting a reopening of the original application filed on her behalf some six years earlier.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.

Reference case 514 F.2d 561 highlights the importance of considering all applicable regulations and overlooking significant factors that may impact the correct adjudication of a claim. In this case, the administrative law judge\'s preoccupation with the claimant\'s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider critical evidence and overlook significant factors that would have bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim.\n\nFurthermore, reference case 527 F.2d 224 emphasizes the need to correct clerical errors or errors on the face of the evidence when reopening a claim. In this case, the claimant\'s testimony and medical records provide adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record and support the reopening of the claim.\n\nWe conclude that the claimant\'s description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing, and the evidence submitted by physicians familiar with her condition supports her claim. The administrative law judge\'s opinion misses the mark, and we find that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period.\n\nTherefore, we remand the case to the Secretary for consideration of the claimant\'s request to reopen because of error on the record. We also note that the claimant\'s request to reopen the 1968 claim is timely, and we will consider this request in conjunction with the Secretary\'s decision on the reopened claim.\n\n\n\ncitations needed to make: [\'514 F.2d 561\', \'527 F.2d 224\']\n\ntarget_text: 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8) provides that a final decision may be reopened at any time “for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.” As the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said in Lauritzen v. Wein-berger, 514 F.2d 561, 563 (8th Cir. 1975), the question for the Social Security Administration on any claim for reopening is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, or whether there is manifest error in the record. This inquiry, in opting for a flexible approach to the doctrine of res judicata, supports the view expressed by this court in Coulter v. Weinberger, 527 F.2d 224, 228 (3d Cir. 1975):\n\nreference_case_1: 514 F.2d 561\n\njudicial review of the August 1, 1967, final determination necessarily bars judicial review of the Appeals Council’s decisions. Mrs. Lauritzen filed a third application for reinstatement of disability benefits on December 8, 1971. In that application, she contended that she had been continuously disabled since 1964. The application was denied and then referred, on Mrs. Lauritzen’s request, to an administrative law judge for decision. He stated that he assumed the matter had been referred to him pursuant to 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8). That section pro vides that an initial, revised or reconsidered determination may be reopened at any time when [s]uch initial * * * determination * * * is unfavorable, in whole or in part, to the party thereto but only for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination * * * was based. (Emphasis added.) The Social Security Claims Manual defines error on the face of the evidence as follows: * * * An error on the face of the evidence exists where, on the basis of all the evidence in the file on which the determination or decision was based and any evidence of record anywhere in the Administration at the time such determination or decision was made, it is clear that the determination or decision was incorrect. * * * A determination or decision which was reasonable on the basis of the evidence in the file and the statute, regulations, instructions, precedents, etc., existing at\n\nreference_case_2: 527 F.2d 224\n\npart provide: “An initial, revised, or reconsidered determination of the Administration or a decision or ¿Wised decision of an hearing examiner or of the Appeals Council which is otherwise final . . . may be reopened: ****** (c) At any time when: ****** (8) Such initial, revised, or reconsidered determination or decision or revised decision is unfavorable, in whole or in part, to the party thereto but only for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.” 20 C.F.R. § 404.957. Our review of the record reveals such error as would require a reopening of the 1968 claim under the standard set by the regulations. The hearing officers’ pre-occupation with the claimant’s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider all of the applicable regulations and to overlook a number of other significant factors which would have a bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim. Because of the error of the Social Security Administration in 1959, there was no determination at that time as to whether Coulter was disabled. If a finding of disability had been made, Coulter would have become eligible for payment of benefits in 1960 when the Act was amended to eliminate the age requirement. It seems unlikely that he would have secured any employment thereafter in view of his testimony that he worked in 1961 and 1962 only out of dire need despite his pain, disability and need for\n\nprevious_text: OPINION OF THE COURT\nWEIS, Circuit Judge.\nClaimant Merle Fowler is presently disabled by multiple sclerosis. Hampered by the necessity to establish an onset date within her coverage period, she has been unsuccessful in securing disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. Difficulties in proof abound, for the disease is a progressive one, the initial date of disability is seldom easy to determine, and periods of remission are common. And as if these problems were not enough, they were compounded by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare’s loss or destruction of critical records relating to claimant’s first application for benefits. After a thorough review of the case, we conclude the HEW determination that no disability existed on the last day of coverage, June 30, 1966 is not supported by the evidence. Finding adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record, we remand to the Secretary for consideration of Miss Fowler’s request to reopen because of error on the record.\nFrom the early 1950’s on, Miss Fowler worked for various medical schools as a recordkeeper, secretary, and nurse. From 1963 to 1967, she was employed at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. That institution did not participate in the Social Security program and her coverage earned while at other jobs terminated on June 30,1966. Claimant’s testimony before the administrative law judge revealed that it was during her service at U.C.L.A. that she began to encounter increasingly serious and bizarre physical disabilities. These difficulties included: problems in maintaining her balance that were severe enough to attract accusations of being intoxicated or under the influence of drugs; a four-week period during which she had to crawl because of an inability to stand; slurred speech resulting in communication problems with coworkers and patients; difficulty in typing. Miss Fowler was forced to use up all of her vacation time as well as her sick leave because of her illness. Additionally, she often found it necessary to rest over long lunch hours.\nMiss Fowler continued to cling to her employment because she was living alone and was her own sole means of support. In February 1967, her condition was such that she could no longer be retained even by the most sympathetic and understanding employer. At about this time her condition was finally diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. She then went to live with her sister in Florida, and for a period of about a year and a half was both bedridden and mentally disoriented. During this interval, her sister filed a disability claim for her with the Social Security Administration, which was rejected, according to the sister, because the claimant did not have enough quarters of coverage.\nThe claimant enjoyed a period of remission from 1970 to 1973 when she was able to obtain limited employment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but thereafter her disease was again disabling. She filed for disability benefits on March 25, 1974, alleging disability from 1965. After an initial denial, the Secretary referred her case for disability evaluation to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation. That agency, based on information that severe symptoms were observable at some time in 1965 or early 1966, concluded that a closed period of disability was established between December 31, 1965 and February 1, 1970, when remission occurred. The Secretary, however, disallowed the payment of any benefit because the 1974 claim had been filed more than twelve months after the first period of disability had ceased in 1970. See 42 U.S.C. § 416(i)(2)(E). The claimant then requested a hearing, asserting that the 1968 claim filed by her sister had been erroneously denied and should be reopened. On the basis of the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation disability evaluation, claimant believed she was entitled to benefits for the 1965 — 1970 period. The ALJ, however, bypassed the 1968 claim issue altogether, finding instead that there had been no disability before June 30, 1966. The Appeals Council affirmed and the district court ruled there was substantial evidence supporting the Secretary’s decision.\nLooking first to the determination of the onset of disability, we conclude that there is not substantial evidence to support the ALJ’s decision.\nThe claimant’s description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing. She tried desperately to hold her job and exerted extraordinary efforts to cope with her disability. Her case did not rely upon her testimony alone but was supported by several statements from persons familiar with her at that time. A letter from Justine Walker, a coworker, was received into evidence and corroborated Miss Fowler’s account of her difficulties. In addition, the detailed statements of two physicians who were aware of her condition during the period were made part of the record. Dr. Donald A. Adams, her treating physician, stated:\n“[Bjeyond question . . . she had multiple sclerosis dating back probably to 1965 and early 1966.”\nHe said further:\n“were she an employee of mine during late 1965 and early 1966 I would have had no other alternative except to terminate her due to her illness even though the consequences would have been that she would be unable to procure another job.”\nDr. Jack A. Cannon, her employer in 1965, said that she should not have been working at that time.\n“However, in considering what would happen to her if I did recommend that she be terminated, I had to realize that she would be unable to secure another position because of the problems, and that I could not recommend her for other employment based on her mental and physical condition.”\nHer physician at the time of the hearing, Dr. Lawrence D. Ellis, came to a similar opinion after reviewing Miss Fowler’s records. He believed she was unable to engage in substantial gainful employment for a period beginning in late 1965. Moreover, the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation report, which, after careful study, found that disability existed as of December 31, 1965, was totally ignored in the ALJ’s decision. The ALJ did not refer to any of the foregoing evidence, but merely summarized the medical reports relating to the disability period prior to June 30, 1966 as giving “no indication of severe and protracted disability prior to that date.”\nThis conclusory statement misses the mark on several counts. It fails to observe the appropriate legal standard, whether claimant is unable “to engage in any substantial gainful activity,” 42 U.S.C. §§ 416(i)(l), 423(d)(1), and substitutes a far harsher requirement. Additionally, the statement is directly contrary to the evidence submitted by the physicians familiar with claimant’s condition. In fact, it is not supported by any medical opinion in this case. As we commented in Gober v. Matthews, 574 F.2d 772, 777 (3d Cir. 1978), an ALJ is not free to set his own expertise against that of physicians who present competent medical evidence.\nThe ALJ’s opinion drew some unsupported inferences from the fact that claimant had been employed by physicians. The ALJ commented, “it is axiomatic that physicians take care of their own.” The thrust of this remark is somewhat obscure because the record indicates the employers did take care of claimant by retaining her for a longer period than that which could be justified by her failing health. To that extent, the “axiom” tends to support Miss Fowler’s claim that she continued to work even though physically incapable of performing the tasks demanded of her. Moreover, her employment after the cut-off date does not foreclose an award of benefits since disability “turns on whether she was disabled within the meaning of the Act notwithstanding the fact that she actually did work.” Stark v. Weinberger, 497 F.2d 1092, 1100 (7th Cir. 1974).\nWe find it particularly puzzling that the ALJ ignored the findings on disability reached by the state agency to which the Secretary had referred the matter. That expert body made a determination of disability on less evidence than was submitted to the ALJ. Although findings by other agencies are not binding on the Secretary, they are entitled to weight and must be considered. We said in an early case that the evaluation of disability by the Veterans Administration was critically relevant and material in a parallel Social Security ease. Pulaski v. Finch, 415 F.2d 613, 618 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Cutler v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir. 1975); DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92,101 (5th Cir. 1972). And in a case quite similar to the one at bar, Dunbar v. Califano, 454 F.Supp. 1261 (W.D.N.Y.1978), the court expressed disapproval over an ALJ’s failure to consider the disability finding of a state agency consulted by the Secretary.\nAfter careful review of the record, we are convinced that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period, and the Secretary’s determination to the contrary cannot stand. Indeed, absent the question of timely filing, we would enter judgment for the plaintiff at this point.\nWe must now, then, consider the effect of the 1968 claim.

In reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court determined that a patent merely combining old elements without producing a new function or result was not inventive. Similarly, reference case 106 F.2d 554 reinforces this stance by negating claims that don\'t advance the existing technical field in a substantive way.\n\nIn the present case, Anderson \'125\'s integration of a rotary cutter with spray guns to simultaneously deposit fiberglass and resin fails to constitute a novel invention as defined in these precedents. The combination of these elements, while potentially convenient, does not produce any unforeseen or novel functional results, reflecting the lessons from 219 F.2d 952 and 106 F.2d 554. Thus, the cumulative effect of prior art decisively points to the conclusion that the Anderson \'125 patent lacks the necessary inventive step for patentability.\n\n\ncitations needed to make: [\'219 F.2d 952\', \'219 F.2d 952\', \'106 F.2d 554\']\n\ntarget_text: Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No. 2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise. The method and apparatus claimed by claim 11 of Anderson ’314 “would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * * ” (35 U.S.C.A. § 103) upon perceiving that the strand roving fell to the ground when the operator stopped the machine. “[I]t is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result.” Application of Demarche, 219 F.2d 952, 955, 42 CCPA 793 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 1955). Again, our conclusions in this regard are influenced by the fact that so little time elapsed between the introduction of roving in strands and the application for Anderson’s main patent. Compare Forestek Plating & Mfg. Co. v. Knapp-Monarch Co., 106 F.2d 554, 557 (6 Cir. 1939) (validity of improvement patent upheld in light of prior, repeated unsuccessful efforts).\n\nreference_case_1: 219 F.2d 952\n\n.\n\nreference_case_2: 219 F.2d 952\n\nwinding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant’s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof. The Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel.

Parties\nPlaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H.

Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.\n2. Civil Action\nThis is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.\n3. Background of Patentee\nDavid F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the “Vidal” process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: “hand lay-up” and “matched die (or metal) mold” (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).\n4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method\nThe “Vidal” process involved, in part, the “hand lay-up” process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the “Vidal” process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).\n5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method\n(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called “matched metal mold” or “matched die” process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).\n(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).\n6. Anderson Early Work and Invention\n(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the “matched metal mold” process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *\n7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125\n(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;\n“the depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.” (Column 2, lines 39-52).\nThe form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).\n(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:\n“The present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.” (Column 1, lines 55-65).\n\'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed ■only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim ■6). * * ■*\n11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit\n(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).\n(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff’s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend “Patented Process” while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs’ Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *\nYj * * *\n(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).\n(b) In the Defendant’s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).\n18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs’\nEach of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).\nAt this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the “clearly erroneous” limitation.\nSecond, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of “primary,” as opposed to “ultimate” fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).\nThird, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court’s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court’s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.\nFourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. § 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.\nDirecting our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the “rather severe test” promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?” Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to “scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.” Ibid.\nIn light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson’s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.\nAs the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general — problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the “clearly erroneous” limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.\nIt is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson’s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson’s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).\nPursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson’s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of “obviousiness” and “newness” of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes — both relating to the making of pre-form — combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).\nThe final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson’s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at\n143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, “in that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.” (Anderson deposition at 117).\nA discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court’s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court’s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had “abandoned” its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility’s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson’s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.\nAlthough certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson’s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.\nThe California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson’s case for improvement over the prior art as being “limited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.” Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).\nHaving thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson’s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention — subjecting Anderson ’125 to the “rather severe test” outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson ’125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of “obviousness” of the Anderson combination.\nWhile it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus “occurred to me the moment I saw the roving.” (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or ’51, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson ’125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson’s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson’s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).\nFrom this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson ’125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. § 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining “obviousness” under 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve — the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .\nTo summarize, the Anderson ’125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements “perform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that\n“patentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun — a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.”\nOur conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson ’125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.\nImplicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.

The court needs to consider whether a person of ordinary skill in the field would have arrived at the claimed invention without resorting to inventive ingenuity. In the case of Anderson\'s patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.\n\nIn the reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court held that the patent in question did not meet the requirements of patentability because it was obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field. Similarly, in the reference case 106 F.2d 554, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.\n\nIn the case of Anderson\'s patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious because it was a combination of old elements that were well-known in the field. The court noted that the prior art references, such as the Thompson and Lampe patents, showed that the simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder was already known. The court also noted that the use of a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid was also known in the prior art.\n\nFurthermore, the court found that the claimed invention did not have any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements. The court noted that the materials used in the prior art references did not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics, but the court still found that the prior art references were relevant to the issue of obviousness.\n\nIn conclusion, the court\'s decision in the case of Anderson\'s patents was influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The court\'s finding of obviousness was based on the combination of old elements that were well-known in the field, and the court did not find any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements.\n\n\n\ncitations needed to make: [\'219 F.2d 952\', \'219 F.2d 952\', \'106 F.2d 554\']\n\ntarget_text: Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No. 2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise. The method and apparatus claimed by claim 11 of Anderson ’314 “would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * * ” (35 U.S.C.A. § 103) upon perceiving that the strand roving fell to the ground when the operator stopped the machine. “[I]t is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result.” Application of Demarche, 219 F.2d 952, 955, 42 CCPA 793 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 1955). Again, our conclusions in this regard are influenced by the fact that so little time elapsed between the introduction of roving in strands and the application for Anderson’s main patent. Compare Forestek Plating & Mfg. Co. v. Knapp-Monarch Co., 106 F.2d 554, 557 (6 Cir. 1939) (validity of improvement patent upheld in light of prior, repeated unsuccessful efforts).\n\nreference_case_1: 219 F.2d 952\n\n.\n\nreference_case_2: 219 F.2d 952\n\nwinding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant’s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof. The Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel.

Parties\nPlaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H.

Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.\n2. Civil Action\nThis is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.\n3. Background of Patentee\nDavid F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the “Vidal” process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: “hand lay-up” and “matched die (or metal) mold” (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).\n4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method\nThe “Vidal” process involved, in part, the “hand lay-up” process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the “Vidal” process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).\n5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method\n(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called “matched metal mold” or “matched die” process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).\n(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).\n6. Anderson Early Work and Invention\n(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the “matched metal mold” process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *\n7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125\n(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;\n“the depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.” (Column 2, lines 39-52).\nThe form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).\n(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:\n“The present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.” (Column 1, lines 55-65).\n\'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed ■only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim ■6). * * ■*\n11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit\n(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).\n(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff’s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend “Patented Process” while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs’ Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *\nYj * * *\n(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).\n(b) In the Defendant’s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).\n18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs’\nEach of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).\nAt this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the “clearly erroneous” limitation.\nSecond, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of “primary,” as opposed to “ultimate” fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).\nThird, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court’s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court’s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.\nFourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. § 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.\nDirecting our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the “rather severe test” promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?” Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to “scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.” Ibid.\nIn light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson’s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.\nAs the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general — problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the “clearly erroneous” limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.\nIt is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson’s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson’s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).\nPursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson’s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of “obviousiness” and “newness” of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes — both relating to the making of pre-form — combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).\nThe final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson’s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at\n143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, “in that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.” (Anderson deposition at 117).\nA discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court’s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court’s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had “abandoned” its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility’s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson’s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.\nAlthough certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson’s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.\nThe California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson’s case for improvement over the prior art as being “limited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.” Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).\nHaving thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson’s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention — subjecting Anderson ’125 to the “rather severe test” outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson ’125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of “obviousness” of the Anderson combination.\nWhile it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus “occurred to me the moment I saw the roving.” (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or ’51, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson ’125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson’s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson’s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).\nFrom this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson ’125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. § 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining “obviousness” under 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve — the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .\nTo summarize, the Anderson ’125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements “perform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that\n“patentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun — a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.”\nOur conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson ’125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.\nImplicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.

The order also required the removal of a website operated by the officers, which contained information and recordings that the court deemed to be prejudicial to the trial.\n\nIn reviewing the order, we must consider the prior restraint doctrine, which requires that the record establish a clear and present danger of prejudice sufficient to justify the restriction. As the court in Brown v. United States, 218 F.3d 415 (5th Cir. 2000), held, a prior restraint on speech is presumed to be unconstitutional, and the party seeking to impose the restraint must demonstrate a substantial likelihood of prejudice.\n\nHere, the court\'s order was based on the testimony of the parties, which suggested that they had made extra-judicial comments to the media and on the website. However, as the court in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), held, the mere fact that a party has made extra-judicial statements does not necessarily establish a nexus between the statements and the potential for prejudice to the jury venire.\n\nFurthermore, the court\'s order was not narrowly tailored to excise only those portions of the website that were likely to cause prejudice. Instead, it required the removal of the entire website, which is a broad and overbroad restriction on speech.\n\nIn conclusion, while the court\'s concern about prejudice to the trial is understandable, the order issued is not a narrowly tailored solution to that problem. In the absence of a clear and present danger of prejudice, the court\'s order is an unreasonable determination of the facts and is therefore unconstitutional. The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. \n\ncitations needed to make: [\'279 F.2d 41\', \'682 F.3d 400\']\n\ngold_text: In sum, the district court erred in concluding that the entirety of the Website was substantially likely to cause prejudice. Accordingly, the court’s determination that the entire Website “demonstrate^] a substantial likelihood of impacting the jury venire,” is overbroad and clearly erroneous. See Canal Ins. Co. v. Thornton, 279 F.2d 41, 43 (5th Cir.1960) (concluding that a district court’s determination was clearly erroneous when “there was no basis [in] the record” to support its finding); cf. Batchelor v. Cain, 682 F.3d 400, 413 (5th Cir.2012) (concluding that the state appellate court made an erroneous factual determination that a habeas petitioner waived his request to represent himself when “the record admitted] of no basis” to support the finding). As a result, we must vacate the portion of the order requiring the “takedown” of the Website.\n\nreference_case_1: 279 F.2d 41\n\nbased on such admitted state of facts, cannot stand. The judgment is reversed and is here rendered for appellant.\n\nreference_case_2: 682 F.3d 400\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2); see also Salts v. Epps, 676 F.3d 468, 2012 WL 1034026, at *6 (5th Cir. Mar. 29, 2012) (holding that determination by “state appeals court ... that the [defendants] had waived their right to conflict-free representation ... was an unreasonable determination of fact” under § 2254(d)(2) where the state court record was “devoid of documentation or evidence of th[e] purported waiver”). IV. In sum, we conclude that the trial court violated Batchelor’s Sixth Amendment right to represent himself by erroneously denying a clear and unequivocal assertion of that right. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a). We further conclude that Batchelor has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the state appellate court’s implicit finding that he waived his Faretta request was erroneous, see id. § 2254(e)(1), and that the state appellate court’s denial of Batchelor’s claim on direct appeal resulted from an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence in the state court record, see id. § 2254(d)(2). Therefore, § 2254(d) does not bar issuance of the writ. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of habeas relief. . McKaskle addressed the issue of “what role standby counsel who is present at trial over the defendant\'s objection may play consistent with the protection of the defendant’s Faretta rights.” 465 U.S. at 169, 104 S.Ct. 944. However, the "limits on the extent of standby counsel’s unsolicited participation” set forth in McKaskle, see id. at 177-82, 104 S.Ct. 944, are\n\nprevious_text: HAYNES, Circuit Judge:\nSeveral current and former officers in the Lafayette Police Department (“Officers”) appeal the district court’s grant of a protective order requiring, among other things, that a particular website they operate be “taken down” in its entirety, which was issued at the request of Appellees, officials and entities within the City of Lafayette Police Department (collectively, “Lafayette PD Defendants”). We VACATE in part and REMAND for further proceedings.\nI. Jurisdiction\nA prior motions panel of this court denied the Lafayette PD Defendants’ motion to dismiss this interlocutory appeal for want of jurisdiction. Although the Lafayette PD Defendants do not renew their jurisdictional arguments in their merits brief, we may consider whether we have appellate jurisdiction sua sponte at any time. See Save the Bay, Inc. v. U.S. Army, 639 F.2d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.1981) (“Because we may not proceed without requisite jurisdiction, it is incumbent upon federal courts trial and appellate to constantly examine the basis of jurisdiction, doing so on our own motion if necessary.” (emphasis added)).\nWe agree with the motions panel, concluding that we have jurisdiction pursuant to the collateral order doctrine, which provides appellate jurisdiction to review “a small set of prejudgment orders ... [1] that are conclusive, [2] that resolve important questions separate from the merits, and [3] that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.” Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 103-06, 130 S.Ct. 599, 175 L.Ed.2d 458 (2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have repeatedly found the doctrine applies in cases in which pre-trial orders arguably infringe on First Amendment rights. See In re Hearst Newspapers, L.L.C., 641 F.3d 168, 174 (5th Cir.2011); Davis v. E. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., 78 F.3d 920, 926 (5th Cir.1996). In United States v. Brown, 218 F.3d 415, 420-21 (5th Cir.2000), we concluded that we had jurisdiction to consider a criminal defendant’s pre-trial appeal of a gag order imposed by the district court on litigants in the case. We similarly conclude that we have appellate jurisdiction over the Officers’ challenge here.\nII. Facts and Background\nThe Officers sued under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988, alleging, inter alia, that the Lafayette PD Defendants imposed a “code of silence” to prevent police officers from reporting certain civil rights abuses and corruption within the Lafayette Police Department and that the Lafayette PD Defendants retaliated against them for objecting to these practices. Relevant here, the Officers communicated with the media concerning the case and maintained a website, www.realcopsvcraft.com (the “Website”), which contained: an image of the Lafayette Police Chief, a party in this suit; excerpts of critical statements made in the media concerning the Lafayette PD Defen dants; certain voice recordings of conversations between the Officers and members of the Lafayette Police Department; and other accounts of the Lafayette PD Defendants’ alleged failings. The Officers’ attorneys eventually transferred ownership of the website to one of the Officers.\nIn response to this publicity, the Lafayette PD Defendants sought a protective order seeking certain limits on communications with the media and removal of the Website. At the conclusion of the two-day hearing, the magistrate judge orally granted the Lafayette PD Defendants’ request to limit the trial participants’ communication with the media and public. The magistrate judge then entered a written order accompanied by a memorandum ruling.\nThe magistrate judge opined from the bench that “[t]he [Wjebsite ... is patently offensive on its face as a means of producing information rather than being an objective source of information supposedly created for the protection of the litigants.” In the subsequent written order, the magistrate judge\nordered that the parties’ and their attorneys’ contact and communication with and through the media shall be limited to (a) information contained in the public record; (b) identification of parties and claims/defenses asserted in this matter; (c) the scheduling or result of any step in this litigation; (d) references that investigation(s) is in progress, without disclosure of investigation details; (e) requests for assistance in obtaining evidence or information; (f) warnings of danger concerning the behavior of persons who are parties in this case when there is reason to believe, based on a reasonable factual inquiry, that there exists a likelihood of substantial harm to an individual or the public interest.\nThe magistrate judge “further ordered that the website www.realcopsvcraft.com shall be closed and removed immediately, ceasing all operations and publication, and that the recordings shall not be publicly disclosed outside the confines of this case and any other pending legal proceeding, absent leave of court.” The restrictions on communications with the media were expressly modeled on Louisiana Rule of Professional Conduct 3.6 and the language approved in Brown, 218 F.3d at 429-31, and Levine v. U.S. District Court, 764 F.2d 590, 598-99 (9th Cir.1985). The magistrate judge also “order[ed] the [Wjebsite be taken down” because it “not only con-tainted] comments and information that would violate [Louisiana Rule of Professional Conduct] 4.4, it is and has been used as a vehicle by which to disseminate inappropriate information to the media and the public.” The primary rationale for the order was to allow for a fair trial by avoiding a taint on the prospective jury pool. Over objection, the district court adopted the magistrate judge’s order, and this appeal followed.\nIII. Standard of Review\nWe review a district court’s grant of a protective order for abuse of discretion. Leatherman v. Tarrant Cnty. Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 28 F.3d 1388, 1394 (5th Cir.1994). The district court’s legal conclusions should be reviewed de novo, and its factual findings should not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. See United States v. Aldawsari, 683 F.3d 660, 664 (5th Cir.2012) (explaining that “[b]ecause [evaluating the validity of a gag order] involves constitutional and other legal questions, we review the district court’s orders de novo. Specific factual findings of the district court on the issue are, of course, entitled to review under the clearly erroneous standard.” (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). Importantly, however, “in eases raising First Amendment issues ... an appellate court has an obligation to ‘make an independent examination of the whole record’ in order to make sure that ‘the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.’ ” Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 499, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984) (quoting N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 284-86, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964)).\nIV. Discussion\nWhen restrictions are sought to be imposed on litigants after litigation is filed, a district court must balance a litigant’s First Amendment rights against other important, competing considerations. See Brown, 218 F.3d at 424 (“ ‘[Although litigants do not surrender their First Amendment rights at the courthouse door, those rights may be subordinated to other interests that arise’ in the context of both civil and criminal trials.” (quoting Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 32 n. 18, 104 S.Ct. 2199, 81 L.Ed.2d 17 (1984))). Court orders restricting trial participants’ speech are evaluated under the prior restraint doctrine, which requires that the record establish that the speech creates a potential for prejudice sufficient to justify the restriction. See Brown, 218 F.3d at 424-25. In addition, the restriction must be narrowly tailored and employ the least restrictive means of preventing the prejudice. Id. at 425. We note that the Officers represent that they are willing to accept the application to them of Louisiana Rules of Professional Responsibility 3.6 and 4.4 in this context, although those rules ordinarily would not apply to clients who are not lawyers. They object to the terms of the court’s order only as they support or apply to the portion of the order mandating that the Website be removed in its entirety. Thus, we focus our analysis only on the portion of the order addressing removal of the entire Website.\nWe begin by addressing the necessity of deferring to district courts in matters affecting the daily functioning of their courts. See, e.g., United States v. Gurney, 558 F.2d 1202, 1209 (5th Cir.1977) (“The trial judge is ... granted broad discretion in ordering the daily activities of his court.”). In a broader sense, considerable discretion is vested in district, courts in ensuring fair trials and avoiding a “circus atmosphere” or “chaos” that can be occasioned by unfettered aggression on the part of one or both sides in litigation. See United States v. Harrelson, 713 F.2d 1114, 1117 (5th Cir.1983) (explaining that district court judges possess “broad discretion, based on the law and on [their] common experience,” to ensure a fair and orderly trial). We respect and affirm the district court’s central role in this important process of securing a just and dignified trial proceeding.\nWe disagree, however, with the Lafayette PD Defendants’ implicit suggestion in their briefs (made explicit at oral argument) that the Officers have a complete “either or” choice between filing a lawsuit and exercising their First Amendment rights. This area, as the district court recognized, demands a nuanced approach to the delicate balance between the necessity of avoiding a tainted jury pool and the rights of parties to freely air their views and opinions in the “market square” now taking the form of the electronic square known as the Internet. The district court faithfully and carefully addressed numerous precedents surrounding the use of “gag orders” and applied a careful and nuanced approach in much of the challenged order. When it came to the Website, however, the nuanced approach gave way to a more wholesale striking of its entire content — indeed, the very website itself. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that this wholesale striking cannot stand in its current form.\nWe analyze this issue under the prior restraint doctrine. Court orders aimed at preventing or forbidding speech “are classic examples of prior restraints.” Alexander v. United States, 509 U.S. 544, 550, 113 S.Ct. 2766, 125 L.Ed.2d 441 (1993). Indeed, this court has recognized that “[d]espite the fact that litigants’ First Amendment freedoms may be limited in order to ensure a fair trial, gag orders ... still exhibit the characteristics of prior restraints.” Brown, 218 F.3d at 424; see also Levine, 764 F.2d at 595 (holding that a court’s order prohibiting trial participants from speaking to the media constituted a prior restraint). The order here explicitly restricts the expression of attorneys and parties in this litigation as it relates to the media and prevents the Officers from expression in the Website. As a result, the protective order qualifies as a prior restraint.\nPrior restraints “face a well-established presumption against their constitutionality.” Brown, 218 F.3d at 424-25 (citing Bernard v. Gulf Oil Co., 619 F.2d 459, 467 (5th Cir.1980) (en banc) (citations omitted)); see also Org. for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U.S. 415, 419, 91 S.Ct. 1575, 29 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971) (“Any prior restraint on expression comes ... with a ‘heavy presumption’ against its constitutional validity.”). We must therefore balance the First Amendment rights of trial participants with our “ ‘affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial publicity.’ ” Brown, 218 F.3d at 423 (quoting Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378, 99 S.Ct. 2898, 61 L.Ed.2d 608 (1979)); see also Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966) (“The courts must take such steps by rule and regulation that will protect their processes from prejudicial outside interferences.”).\nThe first step in assessing the constitutionality of a prior restraint requires considering whether the harm the court seeks to prevent justifies the restraint on speech. Brown, 218 F.3d at 425. In assessing restrictions on speech, courts have required that the record establish different levels of harm, including a “clear and present danger,” “substantial likelihood,” or “reasonable likelihood” of prejudice. We have not clearly delineated which standard applies to the parties (rather than the media) in civil litigation.\nIn Brown, we applied a substantial likelihood of prejudice test to both attorneys and parties in the context of a gag order applied in a criminal matter. 218 F.3d at 426 (noting that the Court in Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030, 111 S.Ct. 2720, 115 L.Ed.2d 888 (1991), “approved [a] ‘substantial likelihood’ standard when applied to gag orders imposed on attorneys, but did not mandate it as a constitutional minimum necessary to justify a judicially-imposed restriction on attorney speech”). As “[t]he Supreme Court has recognized that conflict between freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial is no less troubling in the non-criminal context,” we conclude that Brown represents the right balance for this civil case. See Bailey v. Sys. Innovation, Inc., 852 F.2d 93, 97 (3d Cir.1988); see also Brown, 218 F.3d at 424 (providing that an individual’s First Amendment rights may be limited by a court order “in the context of both civil and criminal trials ” (emphasis added)). As in criminal matters, civil cases also require avoiding “the potential that pretrial publicity may taint the jury venire, resulting in a jury that is biased toward one party or another,” Brown, 218 F.3d at 423, and preventing the “creat[ion] [of] “a ‘carnival atmosphere,’ which threatens the integrity of the proceeding.” Id. at 423 n. 8. Thus, we apply the Brown standard here.\nIn this case, the testimony during the two-day trial presents significant evidence that the trial participants made extra-judicial comments to the media and on the Website. For instance, Plaintiff Mar-ceaux testified that he had television interviews with two news stations, but he did not provide any newspaper interviews. This testimony, along with the testimony of the other seven witnesses, speaks to the trial participants’ propensity to make extra-judicial statements.\nIt does not, however, establish a nexus between the comments and the potential for prejudice to the jury venire through the entirety of the Website. It is not “narrowly tailored” to excising matters with a sufficient potential for prejudice to warrant prior restraint.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.

Now, you are asked to annotate legal analysis generated by large language models and classify the errors and mismatch made by these models. To produce these legal analysis, a language model will receive the following prompt:\n\nHere are some reference articles for legal cases: \n# Reference case {case_key_1}\n{text of cited case 1} \n# Reference case {case_key_2}\n{text of cited case 2}\n...\n# Reference case {case_key_N} {text of cited case N}\nHere is the text I’ve written so far: # Paragrah\n{previous_text}\nContinue to write it following the style of my writeup. Your answer contains 100 to 400 words. You must explicitly use the reference cases and mention their reference ids, i.e. {case_key_1}, {case_key_2} . . . {case_key_N}. Wrap your answer with <answer></answer>. Make your answer concise and avoid redundant languages.\n\nReceiving the prompt above, a language model will generate a paragraph of legal analysis, but often times they make different kinds of errors and mismatches. \n\nThe instructions for you to classify these errors and mismatches are as follows:\n\nYou should classify the LLM-generated legal analysis to these categories:\n\n1. Intrinsic gap:\nThis category refers to generation that is unacceptable, due to the language model has fundamentally failed to follow the instruction, or make a lot of redundancy, or generate something that does not look like legal text (structural mismatch). More specificially, if it makes one or more of the following:\n\n- Redundancy (sentence-level, appearing as neural degeneration): the generation appears to make repetitive statements that do not add more meaning to the analysis. For example, multiple occurences of an exact sentence or phrase.\n- Citation Format Mismatch: the generation appears not matching with the citation format of the standard Bluebook.\n    - Please be aware that, for example, 440 U.S. 48, 55\' is a proper format. Although its full citation should be \'Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979)\', the format \'440 U.S. 48, 55\' is still acceptable as a concise form.\n- Structural Mismatch: the generation appears to generate the document from scratch (like containing words such as "ORDER" which only appear in the beginning).\n- Stylistic Mismatch: contain sentences that do not match the styles of legalese.\n\nIf this type of gaps is present, add the label `1`. Continue to item 2.\n\nSide note: You should be able to classify this purely based on the generation itself, without having to look at cited examples.\n\n2. Target mismatch:\n\nWhile language model\'s generated text may be obviously wrong and substantively different from the target (i.e. the original/target text from the case), the claims it makes are still logically and factually sound and can be seen as acceptable. This could be because\n - Chain Cite: the citations appear in a chain cite but the generation cites them parallely, or the other way around.\n    - Clarification: "The rule that certain acts of a creditor in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding and during the statutory period for filing proof of claim, may give rise to something equivalent to a proof of claim and afford a sufficient basis for allowing an amendment after the statutory period for filing, was recognized and applied in many cases decided before the 1938 amendment of the Bankruptcy Act. See In re Atlantic Gulf & Pacific S. S. Corporation, D.C., 26 F.2d 751; In re Fant, D.C., 21 F.2d 182; Globe Indemnity Co. of Newark, N. J., v. Keeble, 4 Cir., 20 F.2d 84; In re Coleman & Titus Corporation, D.C., 286 F. 303; In re Roeber, 2 Cir., 127 F. 122." would be a chain cite because all of these citations support the previous claim "The rule that certain acts of a creditor in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding and during the statutory period for filing proof of claim, may give rise to something equivalent to a proof of claim and afford a sufficient basis for allowing an amendment after the statutory period for filing, was recognized and applied in many cases decided before the 1938 amendment of the Bankruptcy Act."\n - Reverse Cite: the citations reverse the ruling in each other but the generation cites them parallely, or the other way around.\n - Compound Cite: the citations of different cases are cited together, separated by semicolons, or the other way around.\n \n Although it does not match with the target, it is still considered somewhat acceptable, but we should label it out.\n\n If this type of mismatch is present add the label `2`. Continue to item 3.\n\n3. Citation Mismatch: The language model\'s generated text does not align with the content of the citation it points to. This might be because one or more of the following:\n\n- Claim Hallucination: the claim supported by the citation is not truthful or not related to the context or from cited paragraphs or the previous context. The generated text makes different and possibly (although not necessarily) contradictory claims about one or more citations, which you can check from comparing to the reference case. Or, the generated text attributes information from one citation to a different citation.\n- Retrieval Inaccuracy: the claims supported by the citation is not relevant because the cited paragraph looks irrelevant compared to the target paragraph. \n- Citation Hallucination: the citation is non-existent or pulled from a citation in the cited paragraphs or the previous context, or there misses a citation (the generated text fails to use one of the citations that were given to it).\n\nIf this type of mismatch is **present**, add the label `3` and move on to the next example. If none of the above errors are present, label \'0\'.\n\nHere are some examples for demonstration:\n\nExample 1:\nUser:\n\nGeneration:\n\nIn the context of reopening Miss Fowler’s 1968 claim, relevant precedent supports such a measure due to administrative errors. Specifically, in 514 F.2d 561, the court allowed reopening where evidence revealed a clear error on the face of the record. The similarities with Mrs. Lauritzen\'s case are striking; both involved overlooked evidence and procedural errors. Moreover, 527 F.2d 224 further emphasizes that initial, revised, or reconsidered claims may be reopened if clerical or evident errors are detected.\n\nApplying these principles, we find the Secretary\'s refusal to reopen Miss Fowler’s 1968 claim to be legally unsupported. The evidence demonstrates errors that warrant reconsideration, thus fitting within the regulatory framework as outlined in the reference cases. Consequently, we remand the case to the Secretary for a substantive review of the 1968 claim, ensuring compliance with the established legal standards set forth in the cases of 514 F.2d 561 and 527 F.2d 224.\n\ncitations needed to make: [\'514 F.2d 561\', \'527 F.2d 224\']\n\ntarget_text: 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8) provides that a final decision may be reopened at any time “for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.” As the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said in Lauritzen v. Wein-berger, 514 F.2d 561, 563 (8th Cir. 1975), the question for the Social Security Administration on any claim for reopening is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, or whether there is manifest error in the record. This inquiry, in opting for a flexible approach to the doctrine of res judicata, supports the view expressed by this court in Coulter v. Weinberger, 527 F.2d 224, 228 (3d Cir. 1975):\n\nreference_case_1: 514 F.2d 561\n\njudicial review of the August 1, 1967, final determination necessarily bars judicial review of the Appeals Council’s decisions. Mrs. Lauritzen filed a third application for reinstatement of disability benefits on December 8, 1971. In that application, she contended that she had been continuously disabled since 1964. The application was denied and then referred, on Mrs. Lauritzen’s request, to an administrative law judge for decision. He stated that he assumed the matter had been referred to him pursuant to 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8).

Our review of the record reveals such error as would require a reopening of the 1968 claim under the standard set by the regulations. The hearing officers’ pre-occupation with the claimant’s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider all of the applicable regulations and to overlook a number of other significant factors which would have a bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim. Because of the error of the Social Security Administration in 1959, there was no determination at that time as to whether Coulter was disabled. If a finding of disability had been made, Coulter would have become eligible for payment of benefits in 1960 when the Act was amended to eliminate the age requirement. It seems unlikely that he would have secured any employment thereafter in view of his testimony that he worked in 1961 and 1962 only out of dire need despite his pain, disability and need for\n\nprevious_text: OPINION OF THE COURT\nWEIS, Circuit Judge.\nClaimant Merle Fowler is presently disabled by multiple sclerosis. Hampered by the necessity to establish an onset date within her coverage period, she has been unsuccessful in securing disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. Difficulties in proof abound, for the disease is a progressive one, the initial date of disability is seldom easy to determine, and periods of remission are common. And as if these problems were not enough, they were compounded by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare’s loss or destruction of critical records relating to claimant’s first application for benefits. After a thorough review of the case, we conclude the HEW determination that no disability existed on the last day of coverage, June 30, 1966 is not supported by the evidence. Finding adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record, we remand to the Secretary for consideration of Miss Fowler’s request to reopen because of error on the record.\nFrom the early 1950’s on, Miss Fowler worked for various medical schools as a recordkeeper, secretary, and nurse. From 1963 to 1967, she was employed at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. That institution did not participate in the Social Security program and her coverage earned while at other jobs terminated on June 30,1966. Claimant’s testimony before the administrative law judge revealed that it was during her service at U.C.L.A. that she began to encounter increasingly serious and bizarre physical disabilities. These difficulties included: problems in maintaining her balance that were severe enough to attract accusations of being intoxicated or under the influence of drugs; a four-week period during which she had to crawl because of an inability to stand; slurred speech resulting in communication problems with coworkers and patients; difficulty in typing. Miss Fowler was forced to use up all of her vacation time as well as her sick leave because of her illness. Additionally, she often found it necessary to rest over long lunch hours.\nMiss Fowler continued to cling to her employment because she was living alone and was her own sole means of support. In February 1967, her condition was such that she could no longer be retained even by the most sympathetic and understanding employer. At about this time her condition was finally diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. She then went to live with her sister in Florida, and for a period of about a year and a half was both bedridden and mentally disoriented. During this interval, her sister filed a disability claim for her with the Social Security Administration, which was rejected, according to the sister, because the claimant did not have enough quarters of coverage.\nThe claimant enjoyed a period of remission from 1970 to 1973 when she was able to obtain limited employment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but thereafter her disease was again disabling. She filed for disability benefits on March 25, 1974, alleging disability from 1965. After an initial denial, the Secretary referred her case for disability evaluation to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation. That agency, based on information that severe symptoms were observable at some time in 1965 or early 1966, concluded that a closed period of disability was established between December 31, 1965 and February 1, 1970, when remission occurred. The Secretary, however, disallowed the payment of any benefit because the 1974 claim had been filed more than twelve months after the first period of disability had ceased in 1970. See 42 U.S.C. § 416(i)(2)(E). The claimant then requested a hearing, asserting that the 1968 claim filed by her sister had been erroneously denied and should be reopened. On the basis of the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation disability evaluation, claimant believed she was entitled to benefits for the 1965 — 1970 period. The ALJ, however, bypassed the 1968 claim issue altogether, finding instead that there had been no disability before June 30, 1966. The Appeals Council affirmed and the district court ruled there was substantial evidence supporting the Secretary’s decision.\nLooking first to the determination of the onset of disability, we conclude that there is not substantial evidence to support the ALJ’s decision.\nThe claimant’s description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing. She tried desperately to hold her job and exerted extraordinary efforts to cope with her disability. Her case did not rely upon her testimony alone but was supported by several statements from persons familiar with her at that time. A letter from Justine Walker, a coworker, was received into evidence and corroborated Miss Fowler’s account of her difficulties. In addition, the detailed statements of two physicians who were aware of her condition during the period were made part of the record. Dr. Donald A. Adams, her treating physician, stated:\n“[Bjeyond question . . . she had multiple sclerosis dating back probably to 1965 and early 1966.”\nHe said further:\n“were she an employee of mine during late 1965 and early 1966 I would have had no other alternative except to terminate her due to her illness even though the consequences would have been that she would be unable to procure another job.”\nDr. Jack A. Cannon, her employer in 1965, said that she should not have been working at that time.\n“However, in considering what would happen to her if I did recommend that she be terminated, I had to realize that she would be unable to secure another position because of the problems, and that I could not recommend her for other employment based on her mental and physical condition.”\nHer physician at the time of the hearing, Dr. Lawrence D. Ellis, came to a similar opinion after reviewing Miss Fowler’s records. He believed she was unable to engage in substantial gainful employment for a period beginning in late 1965. Moreover, the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation report, which, after careful study, found that disability existed as of December 31, 1965, was totally ignored in the ALJ’s decision. The ALJ did not refer to any of the foregoing evidence, but merely summarized the medical reports relating to the disability period prior to June 30, 1966 as giving “no indication of severe and protracted disability prior to that date.”\nThis conclusory statement misses the mark on several counts. It fails to observe the appropriate legal standard, whether claimant is unable “to engage in any substantial gainful activity,” 42 U.S.C. §§ 416(i)(l), 423(d)(1), and substitutes a far harsher requirement. Additionally, the statement is directly contrary to the evidence submitted by the physicians familiar with claimant’s condition. In fact, it is not supported by any medical opinion in this case. As we commented in Gober v. Matthews, 574 F.2d 772, 777 (3d Cir. 1978), an ALJ is not free to set his own expertise against that of physicians who present competent medical evidence.\nThe ALJ’s opinion drew some unsupported inferences from the fact that claimant had been employed by physicians. The ALJ commented, “it is axiomatic that physicians take care of their own.” The thrust of this remark is somewhat obscure because the record indicates the employers did take care of claimant by retaining her for a longer period than that which could be justified by her failing health. To that extent, the “axiom” tends to support Miss Fowler’s claim that she continued to work even though physically incapable of performing the tasks demanded of her. Moreover, her employment after the cut-off date does not foreclose an award of benefits since disability “turns on whether she was disabled within the meaning of the Act notwithstanding the fact that she actually did work.” Stark v. Weinberger, 497 F.2d 1092, 1100 (7th Cir. 1974).\nWe find it particularly puzzling that the ALJ ignored the findings on disability reached by the state agency to which the Secretary had referred the matter. That expert body made a determination of disability on less evidence than was submitted to the ALJ. Although findings by other agencies are not binding on the Secretary, they are entitled to weight and must be considered. We said in an early case that the evaluation of disability by the Veterans Administration was critically relevant and material in a parallel Social Security ease. Pulaski v. Finch, 415 F.2d 613, 618 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Cutler v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir. 1975); DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92,101 (5th Cir. 1972). And in a case quite similar to the one at bar, Dunbar v. Califano, 454 F.Supp. 1261 (W.D.N.Y.1978), the court expressed disapproval over an ALJ’s failure to consider the disability finding of a state agency consulted by the Secretary.\nAfter careful review of the record, we are convinced that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period, and the Secretary’s determination to the contrary cannot stand. Indeed, absent the question of timely filing, we would enter judgment for the plaintiff at this point.\nWe must now, then, consider the effect of the 1968 claim. The 1974 application would not be timely if it constituted the original claim because it was filed more than twelve months after the closed disability period terminated in 1970. The claimant, however, asked that the 1974 claim be considered as one requesting a reopening of the original application filed on her behalf some six years earlier.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.

Reference case 514 F.2d 561 highlights the importance of considering all applicable regulations and overlooking significant factors that may impact the correct adjudication of a claim. In this case, the administrative law judge\'s preoccupation with the claimant\'s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider critical evidence and overlook significant factors that would have bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim.\n\nFurthermore, reference case 527 F.2d 224 emphasizes the need to correct clerical errors or errors on the face of the evidence when reopening a claim. In this case, the claimant\'s testimony and medical records provide adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record and support the reopening of the claim.\n\nWe conclude that the claimant\'s description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing, and the evidence submitted by physicians familiar with her condition supports her claim. The administrative law judge\'s opinion misses the mark, and we find that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period.\n\nTherefore, we remand the case to the Secretary for consideration of the claimant\'s request to reopen because of error on the record. We also note that the claimant\'s request to reopen the 1968 claim is timely, and we will consider this request in conjunction with the Secretary\'s decision on the reopened claim.\n\n\n\ncitations needed to make: [\'514 F.2d 561\', \'527 F.2d 224\']\n\ntarget_text: 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8) provides that a final decision may be reopened at any time “for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.” As the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said in Lauritzen v.

See 42 U.S.C. § 416(i)(2)(E). The claimant then requested a hearing, asserting that the 1968 claim filed by her sister had been erroneously denied and should be reopened. On the basis of the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation disability evaluation, claimant believed she was entitled to benefits for the 1965 — 1970 period. The ALJ, however, bypassed the 1968 claim issue altogether, finding instead that there had been no disability before June 30, 1966. The Appeals Council affirmed and the district court ruled there was substantial evidence supporting the Secretary’s decision.\nLooking first to the determination of the onset of disability, we conclude that there is not substantial evidence to support the ALJ’s decision.\nThe claimant’s description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing. She tried desperately to hold her job and exerted extraordinary efforts to cope with her disability. Her case did not rely upon her testimony alone but was supported by several statements from persons familiar with her at that time. A letter from Justine Walker, a coworker, was received into evidence and corroborated Miss Fowler’s account of her difficulties. In addition, the detailed statements of two physicians who were aware of her condition during the period were made part of the record. Dr. Donald A. Adams, her treating physician, stated:\n“[Bjeyond question . . . she had multiple sclerosis dating back probably to 1965 and early 1966.”\nHe said further:\n“were she an employee of mine during late 1965 and early 1966 I would have had no other alternative except to terminate her due to her illness even though the consequences would have been that she would be unable to procure another job.”\nDr. Jack A. Cannon, her employer in 1965, said that she should not have been working at that time.\n“However, in considering what would happen to her if I did recommend that she be terminated, I had to realize that she would be unable to secure another position because of the problems, and that I could not recommend her for other employment based on her mental and physical condition.”\nHer physician at the time of the hearing, Dr. Lawrence D. Ellis, came to a similar opinion after reviewing Miss Fowler’s records. He believed she was unable to engage in substantial gainful employment for a period beginning in late 1965. Moreover, the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation report, which, after careful study, found that disability existed as of December 31, 1965, was totally ignored in the ALJ’s decision. The ALJ did not refer to any of the foregoing evidence, but merely summarized the medical reports relating to the disability period prior to June 30, 1966 as giving “no indication of severe and protracted disability prior to that date.”\nThis conclusory statement misses the mark on several counts. It fails to observe the appropriate legal standard, whether claimant is unable “to engage in any substantial gainful activity,” 42 U.S.C. §§ 416(i)(l), 423(d)(1), and substitutes a far harsher requirement. Additionally, the statement is directly contrary to the evidence submitted by the physicians familiar with claimant’s condition. In fact, it is not supported by any medical opinion in this case. As we commented in Gober v. Matthews, 574 F.2d 772, 777 (3d Cir. 1978), an ALJ is not free to set his own expertise against that of physicians who present competent medical evidence.\nThe ALJ’s opinion drew some unsupported inferences from the fact that claimant had been employed by physicians. The ALJ commented, “it is axiomatic that physicians take care of their own.” The thrust of this remark is somewhat obscure because the record indicates the employers did take care of claimant by retaining her for a longer period than that which could be justified by her failing health. To that extent, the “axiom” tends to support Miss Fowler’s claim that she continued to work even though physically incapable of performing the tasks demanded of her. Moreover, her employment after the cut-off date does not foreclose an award of benefits since disability “turns on whether she was disabled within the meaning of the Act notwithstanding the fact that she actually did work.” Stark v. Weinberger, 497 F.2d 1092, 1100 (7th Cir. 1974).\nWe find it particularly puzzling that the ALJ ignored the findings on disability reached by the state agency to which the Secretary had referred the matter. That expert body made a determination of disability on less evidence than was submitted to the ALJ. Although findings by other agencies are not binding on the Secretary, they are entitled to weight and must be considered. We said in an early case that the evaluation of disability by the Veterans Administration was critically relevant and material in a parallel Social Security ease. Pulaski v. Finch, 415 F.2d 613, 618 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Cutler v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir. 1975); DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92,101 (5th Cir. 1972). And in a case quite similar to the one at bar, Dunbar v. Califano, 454 F.Supp. 1261 (W.D.N.Y.1978), the court expressed disapproval over an ALJ’s failure to consider the disability finding of a state agency consulted by the Secretary.\nAfter careful review of the record, we are convinced that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period, and the Secretary’s determination to the contrary cannot stand. Indeed, absent the question of timely filing, we would enter judgment for the plaintiff at this point.\nWe must now, then, consider the effect of the 1968 claim. The 1974 application would not be timely if it constituted the original claim because it was filed more than twelve months after the closed disability period terminated in 1970. The claimant, however, asked that the 1974 claim be considered as one requesting a reopening of the original application filed on her behalf some six years earlier.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.

In reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court determined that a patent merely combining old elements without producing a new function or result was not inventive. Similarly, reference case 106 F.2d 554 reinforces this stance by negating claims that don\'t advance the existing technical field in a substantive way.\n\nIn the present case, Anderson \'125\'s integration of a rotary cutter with spray guns to simultaneously deposit fiberglass and resin fails to constitute a novel invention as defined in these precedents. The combination of these elements, while potentially convenient, does not produce any unforeseen or novel functional results, reflecting the lessons from 219 F.2d 952 and 106 F.2d 554. Thus, the cumulative effect of prior art decisively points to the conclusion that the Anderson \'125 patent lacks the necessary inventive step for patentability.\n\n\ncitations needed to make: [\'219 F.2d 952\', \'219 F.2d 952\', \'106 F.2d 554\']\n\ntarget_text: Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No. 2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise. The method and apparatus claimed by claim 11 of Anderson ’314 “would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * * ” (35 U.S.C.A. § 103) upon perceiving that the strand roving fell to the ground when the operator stopped the machine. “[I]t is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result.” Application of Demarche, 219 F.2d 952, 955, 42 CCPA 793 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 1955). Again, our conclusions in this regard are influenced by the fact that so little time elapsed between the introduction of roving in strands and the application for Anderson’s main patent. Compare Forestek Plating & Mfg. Co. v. Knapp-Monarch Co., 106 F.2d 554, 557 (6 Cir. 1939) (validity of improvement patent upheld in light of prior, repeated unsuccessful efforts).\n\nreference_case_1: 219 F.2d 952\n\n.\n\nreference_case_2: 219 F.2d 952\n\nwinding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant’s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof. The Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel.

Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court’s findings of fact as follows:\n1. Parties\nPlaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida, Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.\n2. Civil Action\nThis is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.\n3. Background of Patentee\nDavid F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the “Vidal” process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: “hand lay-up” and “matched die (or metal) mold” (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).\n4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method\nThe “Vidal” process involved, in part, the “hand lay-up” process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the “Vidal” process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).\n5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method\n(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called “matched metal mold” or “matched die” process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).\n(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).\n6. Anderson Early Work and Invention\n(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the “matched metal mold” process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *\n7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125\n(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;\n“the depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.” (Column 2, lines 39-52).\nThe form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).\n(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:\n“The present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.” (Column 1, lines 55-65).\n\'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed ■only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim ■6). * * ■*\n11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit\n(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).\n(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff’s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend “Patented Process” while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs’ Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *\nYj * * *\n(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).\n(b) In the Defendant’s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).\n18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs’\nEach of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).\nAt this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the “clearly erroneous” limitation.\nSecond, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of “primary,” as opposed to “ultimate” fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).\nThird, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court’s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court’s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.\nFourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. § 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.\nDirecting our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the “rather severe test” promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?” Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to “scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.” Ibid.\nIn light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson’s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.\nAs the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general — problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the “clearly erroneous” limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.\nIt is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson’s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson’s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).\nPursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson’s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of “obviousiness” and “newness” of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes — both relating to the making of pre-form — combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).\nThe final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson’s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at\n143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, “in that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.” (Anderson deposition at 117).\nA discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court’s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court’s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had “abandoned” its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility’s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson’s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.\nAlthough certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson’s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.\nThe California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson’s case for improvement over the prior art as being “limited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.” Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).\nHaving thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson’s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention — subjecting Anderson ’125 to the “rather severe test” outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson ’125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of “obviousness” of the Anderson combination.\nWhile it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus “occurred to me the moment I saw the roving.” (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or ’51, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson ’125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson’s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson’s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).\nFrom this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson ’125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. § 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining “obviousness” under 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve — the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .\nTo summarize, the Anderson ’125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements “perform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that\n“patentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun — a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.”\nOur conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson ’125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.\nImplicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.

The court needs to consider whether a person of ordinary skill in the field would have arrived at the claimed invention without resorting to inventive ingenuity. In the case of Anderson\'s patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.\n\nIn the reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court held that the patent in question did not meet the requirements of patentability because it was obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field. Similarly, in the reference case 106 F.2d 554, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.\n\nIn the case of Anderson\'s patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious because it was a combination of old elements that were well-known in the field. The court noted that the prior art references, such as the Thompson and Lampe patents, showed that the simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder was already known. The court also noted that the use of a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid was also known in the prior art.\n\nFurthermore, the court found that the claimed invention did not have any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements. The court noted that the materials used in the prior art references did not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics, but the court still found that the prior art references were relevant to the issue of obviousness.\n\nIn conclusion, the court\'s decision in the case of Anderson\'s patents was influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The court\'s finding of obviousness was based on the combination of old elements that were well-known in the field, and the court did not find any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements.\n\n\n\ncitations needed to make: [\'219 F.2d 952\', \'219 F.2d 952\', \'106 F.2d 554\']\n\ntarget_text: Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No. 2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise. The method and apparatus claimed by claim 11 of Anderson ’314 “would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * * ” (35 U.S.C.A. § 103) upon perceiving that the strand roving fell to the ground when the operator stopped the machine. “[I]t is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result.” Application of Demarche, 219 F.2d 952, 955, 42 CCPA 793 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 1955). Again, our conclusions in this regard are influenced by the fact that so little time elapsed between the introduction of roving in strands and the application for Anderson’s main patent. Compare Forestek Plating & Mfg. Co. v. Knapp-Monarch Co., 106 F.2d 554, 557 (6 Cir. 1939) (validity of improvement patent upheld in light of prior, repeated unsuccessful efforts).\n\nreference_case_1: 219 F.2d 952\n\n.\n\nreference_case_2: 219 F.2d 952\n\nwinding machines which stops the machine when the tension of the yarn being wound exceeds a predetermined amount. The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant’s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof. The Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel.

Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court’s findings of fact as follows:\n1. Parties\nPlaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida, Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.\n2. Civil Action\nThis is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.\n3. Background of Patentee\nDavid F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the “Vidal” process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: “hand lay-up” and “matched die (or metal) mold” (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).\n4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method\nThe “Vidal” process involved, in part, the “hand lay-up” process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the “Vidal” process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).\n5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method\n(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called “matched metal mold” or “matched die” process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).\n(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).\n6. Anderson Early Work and Invention\n(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the “matched metal mold” process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *\n7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125\n(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;\n“the depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.” (Column 2, lines 39-52).\nThe form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).\n(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:\n“The present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.” (Column 1, lines 55-65).\n\'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed ■only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim ■6). * * ■*\n11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit\n(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).\n(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff’s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend “Patented Process” while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs’ Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *\nYj * * *\n(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).\n(b) In the Defendant’s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).\n18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs’\nEach of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).\nAt this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the “clearly erroneous” limitation.\nSecond, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of “primary,” as opposed to “ultimate” fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).\nThird, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court’s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court’s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.\nFourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. § 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.\nDirecting our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the “rather severe test” promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?” Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to “scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.” Ibid.\nIn light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson’s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.\nAs the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general — problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the “clearly erroneous” limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.\nIt is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson’s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson’s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).\nPursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson’s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of “obviousiness” and “newness” of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes — both relating to the making of pre-form — combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).\nThe final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson’s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at\n143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, “in that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.” (Anderson deposition at 117).\nA discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court’s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court’s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had “abandoned” its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility’s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson’s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.\nAlthough certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson’s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.\nThe California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson’s case for improvement over the prior art as being “limited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.” Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).\nHaving thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson’s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention — subjecting Anderson ’125 to the “rather severe test” outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson ’125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of “obviousness” of the Anderson combination.\nWhile it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus “occurred to me the moment I saw the roving.” (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or ’51, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson ’125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson’s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson’s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).\nFrom this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson ’125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. § 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining “obviousness” under 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve — the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .\nTo summarize, the Anderson ’125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements “perform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that\n“patentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun — a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.”\nOur conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson ’125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.\nImplicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.

The order also required the removal of a website operated by the officers, which contained information and recordings that the court deemed to be prejudicial to the trial.\n\nIn reviewing the order, we must consider the prior restraint doctrine, which requires that the record establish a clear and present danger of prejudice sufficient to justify the restriction. As the court in Brown v. United States, 218 F.3d 415 (5th Cir. 2000), held, a prior restraint on speech is presumed to be unconstitutional, and the party seeking to impose the restraint must demonstrate a substantial likelihood of prejudice.\n\nHere, the court\'s order was based on the testimony of the parties, which suggested that they had made extra-judicial comments to the media and on the website. However, as the court in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), held, the mere fact that a party has made extra-judicial statements does not necessarily establish a nexus between the statements and the potential for prejudice to the jury venire.\n\nFurthermore, the court\'s order was not narrowly tailored to excise only those portions of the website that were likely to cause prejudice. Instead, it required the removal of the entire website, which is a broad and overbroad restriction on speech.\n\nIn conclusion, while the court\'s concern about prejudice to the trial is understandable, the order issued is not a narrowly tailored solution to that problem. In the absence of a clear and present danger of prejudice, the court\'s order is an unreasonable determination of the facts and is therefore unconstitutional. The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. \n\ncitations needed to make: [\'279 F.2d 41\', \'682 F.3d 400\']\n\ngold_text: In sum, the district court erred in concluding that the entirety of the Website was substantially likely to cause prejudice. Accordingly, the court’s determination that the entire Website “demonstrate^] a substantial likelihood of impacting the jury venire,” is overbroad and clearly erroneous. See Canal Ins. Co. v. Thornton, 279 F.2d 41, 43 (5th Cir.1960) (concluding that a district court’s determination was clearly erroneous when “there was no basis [in] the record” to support its finding); cf. Batchelor v. Cain, 682 F.3d 400, 413 (5th Cir.2012) (concluding that the state appellate court made an erroneous factual determination that a habeas petitioner waived his request to represent himself when “the record admitted] of no basis” to support the finding). As a result, we must vacate the portion of the order requiring the “takedown” of the Website.\n\nreference_case_1: 279 F.2d 41\n\nbased on such admitted state of facts, cannot stand. The judgment is reversed and is here rendered for appellant.\n\nreference_case_2: 682 F.3d 400\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2); see also Salts v. Epps, 676 F.3d 468, 2012 WL 1034026, at *6 (5th Cir. Mar. 29, 2012) (holding that determination by “state appeals court ... that the [defendants] had waived their right to conflict-free representation ... was an unreasonable determination of fact” under § 2254(d)(2) where the state court record was “devoid of documentation or evidence of th[e] purported waiver”). IV. In sum, we conclude that the trial court violated Batchelor’s Sixth Amendment right to represent himself by erroneously denying a clear and unequivocal assertion of that right. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a). We further conclude that Batchelor has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the state appellate court’s implicit finding that he waived his Faretta request was erroneous, see id. § 2254(e)(1), and that the state appellate court’s denial of Batchelor’s claim on direct appeal resulted from an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence in the state court record, see id. § 2254(d)(2). Therefore, § 2254(d) does not bar issuance of the writ. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of habeas relief. . McKaskle addressed the issue of “what role standby counsel who is present at trial over the defendant\'s objection may play consistent with the protection of the defendant’s Faretta rights.” 465 U.S. at 169, 104 S.Ct. 944. However, the "limits on the extent of standby counsel’s unsolicited participation” set forth in McKaskle, see id. at 177-82, 104 S.Ct. 944, are\n\nprevious_text: HAYNES, Circuit Judge:\nSeveral current and former officers in the Lafayette Police Department (“Officers”) appeal the district court’s grant of a protective order requiring, among other things, that a particular website they operate be “taken down” in its entirety, which was issued at the request of Appellees, officials and entities within the City of Lafayette Police Department (collectively, “Lafayette PD Defendants”). We VACATE in part and REMAND for further proceedings.\nI. Jurisdiction\nA prior motions panel of this court denied the Lafayette PD Defendants’ motion to dismiss this interlocutory appeal for want of jurisdiction. Although the Lafayette PD Defendants do not renew their jurisdictional arguments in their merits brief, we may consider whether we have appellate jurisdiction sua sponte at any time. See Save the Bay, Inc. v. U.S. Army, 639 F.2d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.1981) (“Because we may not proceed without requisite jurisdiction, it is incumbent upon federal courts trial and appellate to constantly examine the basis of jurisdiction, doing so on our own motion if necessary.” (emphasis added)).\nWe agree with the motions panel, concluding that we have jurisdiction pursuant to the collateral order doctrine, which provides appellate jurisdiction to review “a small set of prejudgment orders ... [1] that are conclusive, [2] that resolve important questions separate from the merits, and [3] that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.” Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 103-06, 130 S.Ct. 599, 175 L.Ed.2d 458 (2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have repeatedly found the doctrine applies in cases in which pre-trial orders arguably infringe on First Amendment rights. See In re Hearst Newspapers, L.L.C., 641 F.3d 168, 174 (5th Cir.2011); Davis v. E. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., 78 F.3d 920, 926 (5th Cir.1996). In United States v. Brown, 218 F.3d 415, 420-21 (5th Cir.2000), we concluded that we had jurisdiction to consider a criminal defendant’s pre-trial appeal of a gag order imposed by the district court on litigants in the case. We similarly conclude that we have appellate jurisdiction over the Officers’ challenge here.\nII. Facts and Background\nThe Officers sued under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988, alleging, inter alia, that the Lafayette PD Defendants imposed a “code of silence” to prevent police officers from reporting certain civil rights abuses and corruption within the Lafayette Police Department and that the Lafayette PD Defendants retaliated against them for objecting to these practices. Relevant here, the Officers communicated with the media concerning the case and maintained a website, www.realcopsvcraft.com (the “Website”), which contained: an image of the Lafayette Police Chief, a party in this suit; excerpts of critical statements made in the media concerning the Lafayette PD Defen dants; certain voice recordings of conversations between the Officers and members of the Lafayette Police Department; and other accounts of the Lafayette PD Defendants’ alleged failings. The Officers’ attorneys eventually transferred ownership of the website to one of the Officers.\nIn response to this publicity, the Lafayette PD Defendants sought a protective order seeking certain limits on communications with the media and removal of the Website. At the conclusion of the two-day hearing, the magistrate judge orally granted the Lafayette PD Defendants’ request to limit the trial participants’ communication with the media and public. The magistrate judge then entered a written order accompanied by a memorandum ruling.\nThe magistrate judge opined from the bench that “[t]he [Wjebsite ... is patently offensive on its face as a means of producing information rather than being an objective source of information supposedly created for the protection of the litigants.” In the subsequent written order, the magistrate judge\nordered that the parties’ and their attorneys’ contact and communication with and through the media shall be limited to (a) information contained in the public record; (b) identification of parties and claims/defenses asserted in this matter; (c) the scheduling or result of any step in this litigation; (d) references that investigation(s) is in progress, without disclosure of investigation details; (e) requests for assistance in obtaining evidence or information; (f) warnings of danger concerning the behavior of persons who are parties in this case when there is reason to believe, based on a reasonable factual inquiry, that there exists a likelihood of substantial harm to an individual or the public interest.\nThe magistrate judge “further ordered that the website www.realcopsvcraft.com shall be closed and removed immediately, ceasing all operations and publication, and that the recordings shall not be publicly disclosed outside the confines of this case and any other pending legal proceeding, absent leave of court.” The restrictions on communications with the media were expressly modeled on Louisiana Rule of Professional Conduct 3.6 and the language approved in Brown, 218 F.3d at 429-31, and Levine v. U.S. District Court, 764 F.2d 590, 598-99 (9th Cir.1985). The magistrate judge also “order[ed] the [Wjebsite be taken down” because it “not only con-tainted] comments and information that would violate [Louisiana Rule of Professional Conduct] 4.4, it is and has been used as a vehicle by which to disseminate inappropriate information to the media and the public.” The primary rationale for the order was to allow for a fair trial by avoiding a taint on the prospective jury pool. Over objection, the district court adopted the magistrate judge’s order, and this appeal followed.\nIII. Standard of Review\nWe review a district court’s grant of a protective order for abuse of discretion. Leatherman v. Tarrant Cnty. Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 28 F.3d 1388, 1394 (5th Cir.1994). The district court’s legal conclusions should be reviewed de novo, and its factual findings should not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. See United States v. Aldawsari, 683 F.3d 660, 664 (5th Cir.2012) (explaining that “[b]ecause [evaluating the validity of a gag order] involves constitutional and other legal questions, we review the district court’s orders de novo. Specific factual findings of the district court on the issue are, of course, entitled to review under the clearly erroneous standard.” (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). Importantly, however, “in eases raising First Amendment issues ... an appellate court has an obligation to ‘make an independent examination of the whole record’ in order to make sure that ‘the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.’ ” Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 499, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984) (quoting N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 284-86, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964)).\nIV. Discussion\nWhen restrictions are sought to be imposed on litigants after litigation is filed, a district court must balance a litigant’s First Amendment rights against other important, competing considerations. See Brown, 218 F.3d at 424 (“ ‘[Although litigants do not surrender their First Amendment rights at the courthouse door, those rights may be subordinated to other interests that arise’ in the context of both civil and criminal trials.” (quoting Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 32 n. 18, 104 S.Ct. 2199, 81 L.Ed.2d 17 (1984))). Court orders restricting trial participants’ speech are evaluated under the prior restraint doctrine, which requires that the record establish that the speech creates a potential for prejudice sufficient to justify the restriction. See Brown, 218 F.3d at 424-25. In addition, the restriction must be narrowly tailored and employ the least restrictive means of preventing the prejudice. Id. at 425. We note that the Officers represent that they are willing to accept the application to them of Louisiana Rules of Professional Responsibility 3.6 and 4.4 in this context, although those rules ordinarily would not apply to clients who are not lawyers. They object to the terms of the court’s order only as they support or apply to the portion of the order mandating that the Website be removed in its entirety. Thus, we focus our analysis only on the portion of the order addressing removal of the entire Website.\nWe begin by addressing the necessity of deferring to district courts in matters affecting the daily functioning of their courts. See, e.g., United States v. Gurney, 558 F.2d 1202, 1209 (5th Cir.1977) (“The trial judge is ... granted broad discretion in ordering the daily activities of his court.”). In a broader sense, considerable discretion is vested in district, courts in ensuring fair trials and avoiding a “circus atmosphere” or “chaos” that can be occasioned by unfettered aggression on the part of one or both sides in litigation. See United States v. Harrelson, 713 F.2d 1114, 1117 (5th Cir.1983) (explaining that district court judges possess “broad discretion, based on the law and on [their] common experience,” to ensure a fair and orderly trial). We respect and affirm the district court’s central role in this important process of securing a just and dignified trial proceeding.\nWe disagree, however, with the Lafayette PD Defendants’ implicit suggestion in their briefs (made explicit at oral argument) that the Officers have a complete “either or” choice between filing a lawsuit and exercising their First Amendment rights. This area, as the district court recognized, demands a nuanced approach to the delicate balance between the necessity of avoiding a tainted jury pool and the rights of parties to freely air their views and opinions in the “market square” now taking the form of the electronic square known as the Internet. The district court faithfully and carefully addressed numerous precedents surrounding the use of “gag orders” and applied a careful and nuanced approach in much of the challenged order. When it came to the Website, however, the nuanced approach gave way to a more wholesale striking of its entire content — indeed, the very website itself. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that this wholesale striking cannot stand in its current form.\nWe analyze this issue under the prior restraint doctrine. Court orders aimed at preventing or forbidding speech “are classic examples of prior restraints.” Alexander v. United States, 509 U.S. 544, 550, 113 S.Ct. 2766, 125 L.Ed.2d 441 (1993). Indeed, this court has recognized that “[d]espite the fact that litigants’ First Amendment freedoms may be limited in order to ensure a fair trial, gag orders ... still exhibit the characteristics of prior restraints.” Brown, 218 F.3d at 424; see also Levine, 764 F.2d at 595 (holding that a court’s order prohibiting trial participants from speaking to the media constituted a prior restraint). The order here explicitly restricts the expression of attorneys and parties in this litigation as it relates to the media and prevents the Officers from expression in the Website. As a result, the protective order qualifies as a prior restraint.\nPrior restraints “face a well-established presumption against their constitutionality.” Brown, 218 F.3d at 424-25 (citing Bernard v. Gulf Oil Co., 619 F.2d 459, 467 (5th Cir.1980) (en banc) (citations omitted)); see also Org. for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U.S. 415, 419, 91 S.Ct. 1575, 29 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971) (“Any prior restraint on expression comes ... with a ‘heavy presumption’ against its constitutional validity.”). We must therefore balance the First Amendment rights of trial participants with our “ ‘affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial publicity.’ ” Brown, 218 F.3d at 423 (quoting Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378, 99 S.Ct. 2898, 61 L.Ed.2d 608 (1979)); see also Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966) (“The courts must take such steps by rule and regulation that will protect their processes from prejudicial outside interferences.”).\nThe first step in assessing the constitutionality of a prior restraint requires considering whether the harm the court seeks to prevent justifies the restraint on speech. Brown, 218 F.3d at 425. In assessing restrictions on speech, courts have required that the record establish different levels of harm, including a “clear and present danger,” “substantial likelihood,” or “reasonable likelihood” of prejudice. We have not clearly delineated which standard applies to the parties (rather than the media) in civil litigation.\nIn Brown, we applied a substantial likelihood of prejudice test to both attorneys and parties in the context of a gag order applied in a criminal matter. 218 F.3d at 426 (noting that the Court in Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030, 111 S.Ct. 2720, 115 L.Ed.2d 888 (1991), “approved [a] ‘substantial likelihood’ standard when applied to gag orders imposed on attorneys, but did not mandate it as a constitutional minimum necessary to justify a judicially-imposed restriction on attorney speech”). As “[t]he Supreme Court has recognized that conflict between freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial is no less troubling in the non-criminal context,” we conclude that Brown represents the right balance for this civil case. See Bailey v. Sys. Innovation, Inc., 852 F.2d 93, 97 (3d Cir.1988); see also Brown, 218 F.3d at 424 (providing that an individual’s First Amendment rights may be limited by a court order “in the context of both civil and criminal trials ” (emphasis added)). As in criminal matters, civil cases also require avoiding “the potential that pretrial publicity may taint the jury venire, resulting in a jury that is biased toward one party or another,” Brown, 218 F.3d at 423, and preventing the “creat[ion] [of] “a ‘carnival atmosphere,’ which threatens the integrity of the proceeding.” Id. at 423 n. 8. Thus, we apply the Brown standard here.\nIn this case, the testimony during the two-day trial presents significant evidence that the trial participants made extra-judicial comments to the media and on the Website. For instance, Plaintiff Mar-ceaux testified that he had television interviews with two news stations, but he did not provide any newspaper interviews. This testimony, along with the testimony of the other seven witnesses, speaks to the trial participants’ propensity to make extra-judicial statements.\nIt does not, however, establish a nexus between the comments and the potential for prejudice to the jury venire through the entirety of the Website. It is not “narrowly tailored” to excising matters with a sufficient potential for prejudice to warrant prior restraint.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.

Now, you are asked to annotate legal analysis generated by large language models and classify the errors and mismatch made by these models. To produce these legal analysis, a language model will receive the following prompt:\n\nHere are some reference articles for legal cases: \n# Reference case {case_key_1}\n{text of cited case 1} \n# Reference case {case_key_2}\n{text of cited case 2}\n...\n# Reference case {case_key_N} {text of cited case N}\nHere is the text I’ve written so far: # Paragrah\n{previous_text}\nContinue to write it following the style of my writeup. Your answer contains 100 to 400 words. You must explicitly use the reference cases and mention their reference ids, i.e. {case_key_1}, {case_key_2} . . . {case_key_N}. Wrap your answer with <answer></answer>. Make your answer concise and avoid redundant languages.\n\nReceiving the prompt above, a language model will generate a paragraph of legal analysis, but often times they make different kinds of errors and mismatches. \n\nThe instructions for you to classify these errors and mismatches are as follows:\n\nYou should classify the LLM-generated legal analysis to these categories:\n\n1. Intrinsic gap:\nThis category refers to generation that is unacceptable, due to the language model has fundamentally failed to follow the instruction, or make a lot of redundancy, or generate something that does not look like legal text (structural mismatch). More specificially, if it makes one or more of the following:\n\n- Redundancy (sentence-level, appearing as neural degeneration): the generation appears to make repetitive statements that do not add more meaning to the analysis. For example, multiple occurences of an exact sentence or phrase.\n- Citation Format Mismatch: the generation appears not matching with the citation format of the standard Bluebook.\n    - Please be aware that, for example, 440 U.S. 48, 55\' is a proper format. Although its full citation should be \'Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979)\', the format \'440 U.S. 48, 55\' is still acceptable as a concise form.\n- Structural Mismatch: the generation appears to generate the document from scratch (like containing words such as "ORDER" which only appear in the beginning).\n- Stylistic Mismatch: contain sentences that do not match the styles of legalese.\n\nIf this type of gaps is present, add the label `1`. Continue to item 2.\n\nSide note: You should be able to classify this purely based on the generation itself, without having to look at cited examples.\n\n2. Target mismatch:\n\nWhile language model\'s generated text may be obviously wrong and substantively different from the target (i.e. the original/target text from the case), the claims it makes are still logically and factually sound and can be seen as acceptable. This could be because\n - Chain Cite: the citations appear in a chain cite but the generation cites them parallely, or the other way around.\n    - Clarification: "The rule that certain acts of a creditor in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding and during the statutory period for filing proof of claim, may give rise to something equivalent to a proof of claim and afford a sufficient basis for allowing an amendment after the statutory period for filing, was recognized and applied in many cases decided before the 1938 amendment of the Bankruptcy Act. See In re Atlantic Gulf & Pacific S. S. Corporation, D.C., 26 F.2d 751; In re Fant, D.C., 21 F.2d 182; Globe Indemnity Co. of Newark, N. J., v. Keeble, 4 Cir., 20 F.2d 84; In re Coleman & Titus Corporation, D.C., 286 F. 303; In re Roeber, 2 Cir., 127 F. 122." would be a chain cite because all of these citations support the previous claim "The rule that certain acts of a creditor in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding and during the statutory period for filing proof of claim, may give rise to something equivalent to a proof of claim and afford a sufficient basis for allowing an amendment after the statutory period for filing, was recognized and applied in many cases decided before the 1938 amendment of the Bankruptcy Act."\n - Reverse Cite: the citations reverse the ruling in each other but the generation cites them parallely, or the other way around.\n - Compound Cite: the citations of different cases are cited together, separated by semicolons, or the other way around.\n \n Although it does not match with the target, it is still considered somewhat acceptable, but we should label it out.\n\n If this type of mismatch is present add the label `2`. Continue to item 3.\n\n3. Citation Mismatch: The language model\'s generated text does not align with the content of the citation it points to. This might be because one or more of the following:\n\n- Claim Hallucination: the claim supported by the citation is not truthful or not related to the context or from cited paragraphs or the previous context. The generated text makes different and possibly (although not necessarily) contradictory claims about one or more citations, which you can check from comparing to the reference case. Or, the generated text attributes information from one citation to a different citation.\n- Retrieval Inaccuracy: the claims supported by the citation is not relevant because the cited paragraph looks irrelevant compared to the target paragraph. \n- Citation Hallucination: the citation is non-existent or pulled from a citation in the cited paragraphs or the previous context, or there misses a citation (the generated text fails to use one of the citations that were given to it).\n\nIf this type of mismatch is **present**, add the label `3` and move on to the next example. If none of the above errors are present, label \'0\'.\n\nHere are some examples for demonstration:\n\nExample 1:\nUser:\n\nGeneration:\n\nIn the context of reopening Miss Fowler’s 1968 claim, relevant precedent supports such a measure due to administrative errors. Specifically, in 514 F.2d 561, the court allowed reopening where evidence revealed a clear error on the face of the record. The similarities with Mrs. Lauritzen\'s case are striking; both involved overlooked evidence and procedural errors. Moreover, 527 F.2d 224 further emphasizes that initial, revised, or reconsidered claims may be reopened if clerical or evident errors are detected.\n\nApplying these principles, we find the Secretary\'s refusal to reopen Miss Fowler’s 1968 claim to be legally unsupported. The evidence demonstrates errors that warrant reconsideration, thus fitting within the regulatory framework as outlined in the reference cases. Consequently, we remand the case to the Secretary for a substantive review of the 1968 claim, ensuring compliance with the established legal standards set forth in the cases of 514 F.2d 561 and 527 F.2d 224.\n\ncitations needed to make: [\'514 F.2d 561\', \'527 F.2d 224\']\n\ntarget_text: 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8) provides that a final decision may be reopened at any time “for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.” As the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said in Lauritzen v. Wein-berger, 514 F.2d 561, 563 (8th Cir. 1975), the question for the Social Security Administration on any claim for reopening is whether an injustice has been done to a claimant, or whether there is manifest error in the record. This inquiry, in opting for a flexible approach to the doctrine of res judicata, supports the view expressed by this court in Coulter v. Weinberger, 527 F.2d 224, 228 (3d Cir. 1975):\n\nreference_case_1: 514 F.2d 561\n\njudicial review of the August 1, 1967, final determination necessarily bars judicial review of the Appeals Council’s decisions. Mrs. Lauritzen filed a third application for reinstatement of disability benefits on December 8, 1971. In that application, she contended that she had been continuously disabled since 1964. The application was denied and then referred, on Mrs. Lauritzen’s request, to an administrative law judge for decision. He stated that he assumed the matter had been referred to him pursuant to 20 C.F.R. § 404.957(c)(8).

(Emphasis added.) The Social Security Claims Manual defines error on the face of the evidence as follows: * * * An error on the face of the evidence exists where, on the basis of all the evidence in the file on which the determination or decision was based and any evidence of record anywhere in the Administration at the time such determination or decision was made, it is clear that the determination or decision was incorrect. * * * A determination or decision which was reasonable on the basis of the evidence in the file and the statute, regulations, instructions, precedents, etc., existing at\n\nreference_case_2: 527 F.2d 224\n\npart provide: “An initial, revised, or reconsidered determination of the Administration or a decision or ¿Wised decision of an hearing examiner or of the Appeals Council which is otherwise final . . . may be reopened: ****** (c) At any time when: ****** (8) Such initial, revised, or reconsidered determination or decision or revised decision is unfavorable, in whole or in part, to the party thereto but only for the purpose of correcting clerical error or error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.” 20 C.F.R. § 404.957. Our review of the record reveals such error as would require a reopening of the 1968 claim under the standard set by the regulations. The hearing officers’ pre-occupation with the claimant’s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider all of the applicable regulations and to overlook a number of other significant factors which would have a bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim. Because of the error of the Social Security Administration in 1959, there was no determination at that time as to whether Coulter was disabled. If a finding of disability had been made, Coulter would have become eligible for payment of benefits in 1960 when the Act was amended to eliminate the age requirement. It seems unlikely that he would have secured any employment thereafter in view of his testimony that he worked in 1961 and 1962 only out of dire need despite his pain, disability and need for\n\nprevious_text: OPINION OF THE COURT\nWEIS, Circuit Judge.\nClaimant Merle Fowler is presently disabled by multiple sclerosis. Hampered by the necessity to establish an onset date within her coverage period, she has been unsuccessful in securing disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. Difficulties in proof abound, for the disease is a progressive one, the initial date of disability is seldom easy to determine, and periods of remission are common. And as if these problems were not enough, they were compounded by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare’s loss or destruction of critical records relating to claimant’s first application for benefits. After a thorough review of the case, we conclude the HEW determination that no disability existed on the last day of coverage, June 30, 1966 is not supported by the evidence. Finding adequate evidence to reconstruct the missing record, we remand to the Secretary for consideration of Miss Fowler’s request to reopen because of error on the record.\nFrom the early 1950’s on, Miss Fowler worked for various medical schools as a recordkeeper, secretary, and nurse. From 1963 to 1967, she was employed at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. That institution did not participate in the Social Security program and her coverage earned while at other jobs terminated on June 30,1966. Claimant’s testimony before the administrative law judge revealed that it was during her service at U.C.L.A. that she began to encounter increasingly serious and bizarre physical disabilities. These difficulties included: problems in maintaining her balance that were severe enough to attract accusations of being intoxicated or under the influence of drugs; a four-week period during which she had to crawl because of an inability to stand; slurred speech resulting in communication problems with coworkers and patients; difficulty in typing. Miss Fowler was forced to use up all of her vacation time as well as her sick leave because of her illness. Additionally, she often found it necessary to rest over long lunch hours.\nMiss Fowler continued to cling to her employment because she was living alone and was her own sole means of support. In February 1967, her condition was such that she could no longer be retained even by the most sympathetic and understanding employer. At about this time her condition was finally diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. She then went to live with her sister in Florida, and for a period of about a year and a half was both bedridden and mentally disoriented. During this interval, her sister filed a disability claim for her with the Social Security Administration, which was rejected, according to the sister, because the claimant did not have enough quarters of coverage.\nThe claimant enjoyed a period of remission from 1970 to 1973 when she was able to obtain limited employment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but thereafter her disease was again disabling. She filed for disability benefits on March 25, 1974, alleging disability from 1965. After an initial denial, the Secretary referred her case for disability evaluation to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation. That agency, based on information that severe symptoms were observable at some time in 1965 or early 1966, concluded that a closed period of disability was established between December 31, 1965 and February 1, 1970, when remission occurred. The Secretary, however, disallowed the payment of any benefit because the 1974 claim had been filed more than twelve months after the first period of disability had ceased in 1970. See 42 U.S.C. § 416(i)(2)(E). The claimant then requested a hearing, asserting that the 1968 claim filed by her sister had been erroneously denied and should be reopened. On the basis of the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation disability evaluation, claimant believed she was entitled to benefits for the 1965 — 1970 period. The ALJ, however, bypassed the 1968 claim issue altogether, finding instead that there had been no disability before June 30, 1966. The Appeals Council affirmed and the district court ruled there was substantial evidence supporting the Secretary’s decision.\nLooking first to the determination of the onset of disability, we conclude that there is not substantial evidence to support the ALJ’s decision.\nThe claimant’s description of her difficulties in the 1965-1966 period is convincing. She tried desperately to hold her job and exerted extraordinary efforts to cope with her disability. Her case did not rely upon her testimony alone but was supported by several statements from persons familiar with her at that time. A letter from Justine Walker, a coworker, was received into evidence and corroborated Miss Fowler’s account of her difficulties. In addition, the detailed statements of two physicians who were aware of her condition during the period were made part of the record. Dr. Donald A. Adams, her treating physician, stated:\n“[Bjeyond question . . . she had multiple sclerosis dating back probably to 1965 and early 1966.”\nHe said further:\n“were she an employee of mine during late 1965 and early 1966 I would have had no other alternative except to terminate her due to her illness even though the consequences would have been that she would be unable to procure another job.”\nDr. Jack A. Cannon, her employer in 1965, said that she should not have been working at that time.\n“However, in considering what would happen to her if I did recommend that she be terminated, I had to realize that she would be unable to secure another position because of the problems, and that I could not recommend her for other employment based on her mental and physical condition.”\nHer physician at the time of the hearing, Dr. Lawrence D. Ellis, came to a similar opinion after reviewing Miss Fowler’s records. He believed she was unable to engage in substantial gainful employment for a period beginning in late 1965. Moreover, the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation report, which, after careful study, found that disability existed as of December 31, 1965, was totally ignored in the ALJ’s decision. The ALJ did not refer to any of the foregoing evidence, but merely summarized the medical reports relating to the disability period prior to June 30, 1966 as giving “no indication of severe and protracted disability prior to that date.”\nThis conclusory statement misses the mark on several counts. It fails to observe the appropriate legal standard, whether claimant is unable “to engage in any substantial gainful activity,” 42 U.S.C. §§ 416(i)(l), 423(d)(1), and substitutes a far harsher requirement. Additionally, the statement is directly contrary to the evidence submitted by the physicians familiar with claimant’s condition. In fact, it is not supported by any medical opinion in this case. As we commented in Gober v. Matthews, 574 F.2d 772, 777 (3d Cir. 1978), an ALJ is not free to set his own expertise against that of physicians who present competent medical evidence.\nThe ALJ’s opinion drew some unsupported inferences from the fact that claimant had been employed by physicians. The ALJ commented, “it is axiomatic that physicians take care of their own.” The thrust of this remark is somewhat obscure because the record indicates the employers did take care of claimant by retaining her for a longer period than that which could be justified by her failing health. To that extent, the “axiom” tends to support Miss Fowler’s claim that she continued to work even though physically incapable of performing the tasks demanded of her. Moreover, her employment after the cut-off date does not foreclose an award of benefits since disability “turns on whether she was disabled within the meaning of the Act notwithstanding the fact that she actually did work.” Stark v. Weinberger, 497 F.2d 1092, 1100 (7th Cir. 1974).\nWe find it particularly puzzling that the ALJ ignored the findings on disability reached by the state agency to which the Secretary had referred the matter. That expert body made a determination of disability on less evidence than was submitted to the ALJ. Although findings by other agencies are not binding on the Secretary, they are entitled to weight and must be considered. We said in an early case that the evaluation of disability by the Veterans Administration was critically relevant and material in a parallel Social Security ease. Pulaski v. Finch, 415 F.2d 613, 618 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Cutler v. Weinberger, 516 F.2d 1282, 1286 (2d Cir. 1975); DePaepe v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 92,101 (5th Cir. 1972). And in a case quite similar to the one at bar, Dunbar v. Califano, 454 F.Supp. 1261 (W.D.N.Y.1978), the court expressed disapproval over an ALJ’s failure to consider the disability finding of a state agency consulted by the Secretary.\nAfter careful review of the record, we are convinced that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of disability during the critical period, and the Secretary’s determination to the contrary cannot stand. Indeed, absent the question of timely filing, we would enter judgment for the plaintiff at this point.\nWe must now, then, consider the effect of the 1968 claim. The 1974 application would not be timely if it constituted the original claim because it was filed more than twelve months after the closed disability period terminated in 1970. The claimant, however, asked that the 1974 claim be considered as one requesting a reopening of the original application filed on her behalf some six years earlier.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.

Reference case 514 F.2d 561 highlights the importance of considering all applicable regulations and overlooking significant factors that may impact the correct adjudication of a claim. In this case, the administrative law judge\'s preoccupation with the claimant\'s earnings record in 1962 led to a failure to consider critical evidence and overlook significant factors that would have bearing on the correct adjudication of the claim.\n\nFurthermore, reference case 527 F.2d 224 emphasizes the need to correct clerical errors or errors on the face of the evidence when reopening a claim.

In reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court determined that a patent merely combining old elements without producing a new function or result was not inventive. Similarly, reference case 106 F.2d 554 reinforces this stance by negating claims that don\'t advance the existing technical field in a substantive way.\n\nIn the present case, Anderson \'125\'s integration of a rotary cutter with spray guns to simultaneously deposit fiberglass and resin fails to constitute a novel invention as defined in these precedents. The combination of these elements, while potentially convenient, does not produce any unforeseen or novel functional results, reflecting the lessons from 219 F.2d 952 and 106 F.2d 554. Thus, the cumulative effect of prior art decisively points to the conclusion that the Anderson \'125 patent lacks the necessary inventive step for patentability.\n\n\ncitations needed to make: [\'219 F.2d 952\', \'219 F.2d 952\', \'106 F.2d 554\']\n\ntarget_text: Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No. 2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise.

Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant’s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof. The Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent. The first modification shows a winding machine in which an arm is supported by a portion of the thread being wound, this portion extending between the supply reel and take-up reel.

Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court’s findings of fact as follows:\n1. Parties\nPlaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida, Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.\n2. Civil Action\nThis is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.\n3. Background of Patentee\nDavid F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the “Vidal” process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: “hand lay-up” and “matched die (or metal) mold” (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).\n4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method\nThe “Vidal” process involved, in part, the “hand lay-up” process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the “Vidal” process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).\n5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method\n(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called “matched metal mold” or “matched die” process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).\n(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).\n6. Anderson Early Work and Invention\n(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the “matched metal mold” process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *\n7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125\n(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;\n“the depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.” (Column 2, lines 39-52).\nThe form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).\n(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:\n“The present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.” (Column 1, lines 55-65).\n\'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed ■only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim ■6). * * ■*\n11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit\n(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).\n(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff’s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend “Patented Process” while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs’ Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *\nYj * * *\n(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).\n(b) In the Defendant’s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).\n18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs’\nEach of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).\nAt this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the “clearly erroneous” limitation.\nSecond, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of “primary,” as opposed to “ultimate” fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).\nThird, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court’s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court’s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.\nFourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. § 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.\nDirecting our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the “rather severe test” promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?” Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to “scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.” Ibid.\nIn light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson’s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.\nAs the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general — problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the “clearly erroneous” limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.\nIt is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson’s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson’s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).\nPursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson’s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of “obviousiness” and “newness” of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes — both relating to the making of pre-form — combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).\nThe final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson’s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at\n143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, “in that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.” (Anderson deposition at 117).\nA discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court’s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court’s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had “abandoned” its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility’s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson’s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.\nAlthough certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson’s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.\nThe California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson’s case for improvement over the prior art as being “limited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.” Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).\nHaving thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson’s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention — subjecting Anderson ’125 to the “rather severe test” outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson ’125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of “obviousness” of the Anderson combination.\nWhile it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus “occurred to me the moment I saw the roving.” (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or ’51, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson ’125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson’s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson’s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).\nFrom this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson ’125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. § 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining “obviousness” under 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve — the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .\nTo summarize, the Anderson ’125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements “perform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that\n“patentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun — a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.”\nOur conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson ’125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.\nImplicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.

The court needs to consider whether a person of ordinary skill in the field would have arrived at the claimed invention without resorting to inventive ingenuity. In the case of Anderson\'s patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.\n\nIn the reference case 219 F.2d 952, the court held that the patent in question did not meet the requirements of patentability because it was obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field. Similarly, in the reference case 106 F.2d 554, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious and did not meet the requirements of patentability.\n\nIn the case of Anderson\'s patents, the court found that the claimed invention was obvious because it was a combination of old elements that were well-known in the field. The court noted that the prior art references, such as the Thompson and Lampe patents, showed that the simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder was already known. The court also noted that the use of a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid was also known in the prior art.\n\nFurthermore, the court found that the claimed invention did not have any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements. The court noted that the materials used in the prior art references did not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics, but the court still found that the prior art references were relevant to the issue of obviousness.\n\nIn conclusion, the court\'s decision in the case of Anderson\'s patents was influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The court\'s finding of obviousness was based on the combination of old elements that were well-known in the field, and the court did not find any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements.\n\n\n\ncitations needed to make: [\'219 F.2d 952\', \'219 F.2d 952\', \'106 F.2d 554\']\n\ntarget_text: Turning now to the question of the validity of claim 11, the Anderson improvement patent No. 2,787,314 (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’314), described in detail in the district court’s findings of fact, supra, we feel that its invalidity follows a fortiori from what has been said above. Having concluded that the Anderson ’125 patent is invalid and that its disclosure thus lies in the public domain, we must leave room for mechanical improvements thereto which increase its efficiency, economy of operation and usefulness; otherwise, we make an empty promise. The method and apparatus claimed by claim 11 of Anderson ’314 “would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art * * ” (35 U.S.C.A. § 103) upon perceiving that the strand roving fell to the ground when the operator stopped the machine. “[I]t is not invention to produce a device which is within the realm of performance of a skilled mechanic in the ordinary progress of producing a device to effectuate a given result.” Application of Demarche, 219 F.2d 952, 955, 42 CCPA 793 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 1955). Again, our conclusions in this regard are influenced by the fact that so little time elapsed between the introduction of roving in strands and the application for Anderson’s main patent.

The portion of this patent which is pertinent to the claims under consideration shows three arms fixedly mounted perpendicularly to the axis of a shaft which is spring biased in a predetermined position. Two of these arms have a roller affixed to their ends. The yarn passes under one of the rollers and over another of the rollers. When the tension in the yam exceeds :a predetermined amount, the arms are .caused to move against the bias of the spring. This, in turn, causes rotation of the shaft to which the arms are affixed. The third of these arms is thereby also caused to move. This third arm is mechanically linked to braking mechanism which stops the machine under the foregoing described conditions of increased tension in the yarn. It is to be noted, however, that while the Cannon stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on increase in tension of the thread, appellant’s stopping mechanism stops the winding machine on decrease in tension of the thread, or breakage thereof. The Lebocey patent discloses a device for disengaging the spindles of winders. Two modifications are shown in the patent.

Spray-Bilt, Inc., 220 F.Supp. 65 (S.D. Fla.1963). We can best state the essential facts of the case by quoting certain of the trial court’s findings of fact as follows:\n1. Parties\nPlaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is a corporation of Bermuda. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is a corporation of Ohio and has a principal place of business at Cleveland, Ohio. Defendant Spray-Bilt, Inc., is a corporation of Florida and has a principal place of business at Hialeah, Florida. Defendant David H. Richman is an individual residing in Miami, Florida, Plaintiff Ibis Enterprises, Limited, is the owner of the two patents in suit. Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation is the exclusive licensee of Ibis Enterprises, Limited, under the patents in suit and shares the profits derived from said patents with Canadian Ingersoll Rand Company, a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company.\n2. Civil Action\nThis is a civil action for infringement of United States Patent No. 2,933,125 filed on August 6, 1953 and granted on April 19, 1960 and United States Patent No. 2,787,314 filed on October 13, 1954 and issued April 2, 1957, and for unfair competition in trade. Patent No. 2,933,-125 is the main or basic patent and relates to methods and apparatus for the simultaneous deposition of fiber reinforced plastics; Patent No. 2,787,314 relates to improvement on the methods and apparatus of the main patent. This action was commenced on April 4, 1961.\n3. Background of Patentee\nDavid F. Anderson, the patentee of the patents in suit, is a man of attainments and undenied qualifications. He is a British educated graduate engineer, and he served as a group captain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and did experimental and test work because of his engineering background (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12). Following his retirement from the Air Force, Anderson formed Fiberlast of Canada, a Canadian Corporation (Anderson Tr. pp. 9-12, 51-52) which acquired exclusive rights under the “Vidal” process for forming glass reinforced plastic articles. Anderson became familiar with the several other commercial processes then in use for forming such articles, each of which processes may be grouped in one of two types: “hand lay-up” and “matched die (or metal) mold” (Anderson Tr. 208-220; Tr. 163-166).\n4. Prior Art Hand Lay-Up Method\nThe “Vidal” process involved, in part, the “hand lay-up” process of laboriously hand tailoring and fitting of fiberglass cloth or mat (Exhibit 8) on a mold, hand mixing small batches of a catalyst, promoter and liquid resin mixture which was poured on the tailored cloth. It was necessary to mix these components in small batches from time to time, as the liquid resin solidified within a short time once the setting components of catalyst and accelerator were added. In the “Vidal” process the resin and cloth were covered with a cellophane sheet, and pressure was then applied thereto to distribute the resin (Anderson Tr. p. 52). In the hand lay-up process the plastic was distributed and air bubbles were removed by hand brushing or rolling (Tr. pp. 87, 164, 165; Anderson Tr. pp. 214, 215).\n5. Prior Art Matched Metal Mold Method\n(a) Another process then in use for forming glass reinforced plastic articles was the so-called “matched metal mold” or “matched die” process. This process involved the use of male mold and a complementary female mold. A preform, which comprised chopped strands of fiberglass held loosely in position by a binder of starch or resin and had a general conformation of the molds (Trial Exhibit 17.1), was then placed on one of the molds; resin, catalyst and promoter were than mixed and poured onto the preform; and finally, the other mold was pressed onto the first mold, squeezing the preform and thereby distributing the resin and forming the resultant plastic article (Tr. pp. 73, 114; Rand Tr. pp. 175, 176).\n(b) The fabrication of a preform used in this process is a separate process in which glass roving, a rope-like material made up of several stands of glass loosely held together (Patent No. 2,933,125, Column 1, lines 21-29), is cut and blown -onto a screen having the general conformation of one of the matched metal molds. A vacuum within the screen draws the glass fibers onto the screen. After or during deposit of the fibers on the screen, the fibers are lightly coated with either a powdered or liquid resin or starch merely to hold the fibers together to permit gentle handling of the preform. (Tr. pp. 112-114).\n6. Anderson Early Work and Invention\n(a) Anderson was dissatisfied with the hand lay-up process because of the hand mixing of resins and setting components, the mess created by pouring and spreading the liquid plastic, and the tedious and time-consuming work required to tailor and drape the fiberglass mats to fit compound curves on the mold (Anderson Tr. pp. 54-56). He was further satisfied that he could devise a way to eliminate the expense of pre-form preparation and the high costs and the limited scope of application associated with the molding step required in the “matched metal mold” process (Anderson Tr. p. 59). * * *\n7. Patent in Suit No. 2,933,125\n(a) The apparatus (claims numbered 1, 3 and 6) of the patents in suit is described by the following passages from the specification of patent No. 2,933,125;\n“the depositor is shown as comprising a self-feeding cutter 10 mounted on and driven by a motor 11. Fiber rope, or roving, is guided by a feed pipe 12 into one side of the cutter 10 wherein the roving is cut into the desired lengths and ejected from the opposite side of the cutter 10. Mounted on the opposite ends of the cutter frame 13 are spray guns 14 arranged to direct a spray of atomized plastic on the fiber cuttings ejected from the cutter 10. The sizes and weights of the cutter 10, motor 11 and spray guns 14 are such that the depositor may be hand-held and readily manipulated by the operator to direct a continuous stream of plastic impregnated fiber against a form or mold to build up a lamina of.the reinforced plastic article being fabricated.” (Column 2, lines 39-52).\nThe form of cutter described in the patent comprises a pair of cylindrical rollers parallel to and in frictional contact with each other. One of the rollers is driven by the motor and in turn drives the other roller by the frictional contact between them. One cutter roller has a cutting element like a razor blade imbedded in circumferential spaced relation so as to cut roving passing in between the rollers (Patent 2,933,125, Column 2, lines 39-72, column 3, lines 1-19).\n(b) The methods (claims numbered 2, 4 and 5) of patent No. 2,933,125 are described by the following passages from its specifications:\n“The present invention includes the method of, and a hand-held device for cutting roving into desired lengths, ejecting the cut fiber into a spray of resin and then depositing the impregnated roving on a mold. By cutting the fiber, impregnating it and applying it all in one operation, the operator may readily deposit directly on to the mold only the appropriate quantities of fiber and activiated resin thereby reducing to a minimum wastage of resin, fillers and pigment. Moreover, with this invention the resin and its setting components are mixed only at the point of actual use and hence only as needed.” (Column 1, lines 55-65).\n\'When polyester resin is activated by being mixed with an accelerator and a catalyst, there is a change from a liquid to a solid within a few minutes. In the practice of the process of the patents in suit, the setting components of the accelerator and promoter are contained in separate sprays. The setting components of the liquid plastic are thus mixed ■only upon the meeting and commingling of the sprays of liquid plastic (Patent 2,933,125, Column 4, lines 19-27; Claim ■6). * * ■*\n11. Defendants were Licensees Under Patents in Suit\n(a) During 1958, Defendant David H. Richman was employed as sales manager with Fabulous Fiberglass, Inc., a licensee of the Plaintiif Rand Development Corporation under the patents and pending applications for patents on the Anderson process and apparatus (Richman Tr. pp. 25-35).\n(b) Thereafter in 1959 the Defendants David H. Richman and Spray-Bilt, Inc., became sales agents of Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation (Plaintiff’s Ex. No. 28; Tr. p. 295; Richman Tr. p. 210). Each of the Defendants, while acting as such agents, advertised and lauded to the public their contractual relationship with Rand and the patents on the Rand produced apparatus and the Anderson patented method, and they subsequently terminated their contractual relationship with the Plaintiif Rand but continued for several months thereafter to distribute to the public advertising material showing Rand apparatus; some of this material contained the legend “Patented Process” while making, using and selling admittedly infringing apparatus manufactured by and for the Defendants without license of Rand (Davis Tr. pp. 44-57; Plaintiffs’ Miami Deposition Exhibits Nos. 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 49, 70, 71, 73, 74a, E,F, 76). * * *\nYj * * *\n(a) Claim 11 only of patent No. 2,787,-314 in suit is involved in this suit. The Defendants have denied infringement. Claim 11 defines a feeding mechanism for the cutter described in Finding numbered 7(a), supra, and comprises a guide plate and a pair of parallel rollers positioned on the inlet side of the cutter. This mechanism receives a free end of roving fed through a hole in the guide plate and directs the roving into the rollers of the cutter. The purposes of this mechanism are to permit easy feeding of the roving into the cutter, to eliminate any danger of injury to the operator which is present whenever roving is fed directly into the cutter, and to prevent roving from falling free of the cutter when the operation of the cutter is interrupted (Tr. pp. 158, 159; Patent 2,787,314, Column 4, lines 18-48).\n(b) In the Defendant’s device, there is a single feed roller positioned on the inlet side of the cutter and parallel to one side of the cutter rollers. Roving is fed through holes in a guide plate and in between these rollers and then into the cutter. This feed mechanism is of substantially the same construction and serves the identical purposes as feed mechanism of the patent in suit (Tr. p. 161).\n18. Defendants Palm Off Their Apparatus as Plaintiffs’\nEach of the Defendants offered for sale and in fact accepted an order for sale to Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Florida (Davis Tr. p. 37) apparatus manufactured by Plaintiff Rand Development Corporation and thereafter, in lieu of the Rand apparatus, delivered to Tampa Shipbuilding Co. an infringing apparatus manufactured by the Defendants (Davis Tr. p. 40).\nAt this point several things should be noted: First, finding 6(b) has been omitted. It is, in substance, a legal determination and, thus, is reviewable free of the “clearly erroneous” limitation.\nSecond, without questioning the correctness of the remaining findings actually made by the district court [to the extent that they constitute strictly findings of “primary,” as opposed to “ultimate” fact, see Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 218 F.2d 217 (5 Cir. 1954)], we conclude that they are insufficient in law to sustain the verdict below. There remains a further ground of invalidity not eliminated by the findings below, and since the factual basis for this decision lies undisputed in the record itself, it is unnecessary to remand for further findings. See Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1138, pp. 570-571 (Wright Ed. 1961).\nThird, we are cognizant of the fact that these same patents were recently contested in the Ninth Circuit and found invalid. Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 9 Cir. 350 F.2d 18 (June 29, 1965), affirming 223 F.Supp. 803 (N.D.Calif. 1963). While we realize that this decree of noninfringement cannot deprive plaintiff of the right to an independent judgment against this defendant on this record, we find the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rendered on substantially identical facts, strongly persuasive. See Williams v. Hughes Tool Co., 186 F.2d 278, 281 (10 Cir., 1950). It is true that some of the grounds on which the Ninth Circuit sustained the California District Court’s holding of invalidity of the patent are not open to us in light of fact findings by the lower court in this case which we cannot set aside as clearly erroneous. This does not weaken the reasoning of that Court’s opinion dealing with the ground on which we base our decision.\nFourth, although there may be subtle theoretical distinctions between newness, 35 U.S.C.A. § 101 and non-obvious subject matter, 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 as statutory conditions of patentability, we see no practical reason for treating them as separate questions in this context of combination patents.\nDirecting our attention, then, to the validity of the main Anderson patent (hereinafter referred to as Anderson ’125) allegedly infringed, we are immediately faced with the “rather severe test” promulgated by the Supreme Court to test patents made up of new combinations of old elements, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162 (1950), i. e., are there “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned?” Granted, this test is not an end-all by any means, but it does indicate an approach for determining the validity of combination patents and amounts to a mandate from the Supreme Court to “scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.” Ibid.\nIn light of this mandate, we must ascertain (1) the status of the prior art at the time of Anderson’s claimed invention, (2) what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, and (3) whether what Anderson did is properly to be classified as invention. To achieve meaningful results, greater reliance should be placed upon the history of the art; it is only through such an approach that substance may be injected into the vague, general and often specious tests which abound in this area.\nAs the district court noted, there appear in the record below numerous examples of conflicts in testimony, self-serving statements and credibility problems in general — problems which, of course, must be properly resolved by the lower court, subject to the “clearly erroneous” limitation. The evidence upon which we now rely in reversing, however, stands undisputed in the record.\nIt is clear from the trial record that the concept of spraying two chemical liquid reactants, one of which carries a coagulant, for external and mixing reaction is per se old in the art. E. g., Hanson No. 2,335,116 (Tr. p. 189) ; Hanson No. 1,165,099 (Tr. p. 190); Thompson No. 2,265,209 (Tr. p. 190); Semtex (British) No. 566,543 (Tr. p. 190). Anderson does not purport to be the inventor of the spray guns used in developing the simultaneous depositor (Anderson deposition at 103); nor did he claim to have invented the twin spray technique (Anderson deposition at 155). There appears to be only one substantial reason why the spray guns in the prior art were not suitable to Anderson’s purposes: Anderson could see no way to introduce the chopped fibers between the converging sprays of the Schori gun, as it was then designed (Anderson deposition at 108; Anderson deposition Exhibit 36). It is clear from the record that the problems involved in spraying resin rather than paint had already been explored and apparently solved before the fruition of Anderson’s efforts in this area (Anderson deposition Exhibit 36, Feb. 21, 1951).\nPursuing further this inquiry into the status of the prior art, we turn from the spraying of liquids alone to the method of simultaneously ejecting and spraying various body materials with liquid binders or adhesives. There appear undisputed in the record several prior art references which fit into this general category, e. g., Lampe No. 2,433,463 (Anderson deposition at 172 et seq.); (process of coating asbestos or cork particles in flight with suitable adhesive); Brennan No. 2,408,038 (Tr. p. 185) (spraying of fiber or plaster, coating it with a spray of binder, including resin, to make a finished product (Tr. 220-21); McDonald Nos. 2,313,082 and 2,330,300 (Tr. p. 185) (relating to spraying, of cork with a spray of latex). Moreover, in the specific category of simultaneous deposition of fiberglass with resin binder is Thompson No. 2,850,421 (Tr. 187, 255-58), which utilizes a circular disk cutter to cut roving into short lengths, separating the fibers of the cut roving, projecting them into a jet of uncured plastic resin and, finally, depositing the coated fibers on a mold or surface. Although the Thompson patent was overcome as an anticipation by the filing, of Anderson’s affidavit under Patent Office Rule 131, it remains as evidence relevant to the issue of “obviousiness” and “newness” of.the Anderson combination. Also within the reinforced plastic field is the prior art involved in the previous two-step method of making fiberglass reinforced plastic, illustrated by Essman No. 2,653,335 (Tr. 187) and Bacon No. 2,702,261 (Tr. 187). These latter two processes — both relating to the making of pre-form — combine a cutter element (to be discussed herein) with a resin impregnator element. Glass strands are fed into a separate cutter, and the cut fibers are then dropped on to a pre-form screen (shaped in the form of the desired finished product), described more fully in finding of fact 5(b), supra. In this process the fibers are coated with a binder so that the pre-form can be more easily handled and carried to the matched die molding stage (Tr. 194-96).\nThe final component of the relevant prior art which must be examined is the rotary cutter or chopper designed to sever fiberglass strands into shorter fiberglass lengths. The use of such cutters was old per se in the art, e. g., Bacon and Essman, supra; Slayter No. 2,618,-817 (Tr. 183, 281) (relating to the cutting of fiberglass insulation). The cutters utilized in the Bacon and Essman processes were apparently based upon the principle of the Brenner and Turner cutters (Anderson deposition at 113-114, 241; Tr. 194), both of which admittedly preceded Anderson’s activity in the field by several years (Anderson deposition at\n143). Anderson acknowledged his familiarity with the operation of both cutters prior to 1952 (Anderson deposition at 113-119), and furthermore, he admitted that they were the same in principle as his cutter, “in that the roving was cut by a blade which was protruding from a roller, and cut the roving against a resilient roller, in this case rubber.” (Anderson deposition at 117).\nA discussion of the prior art and use would be incomplete without reference to the activities of Utility Trailer Co., a detailed description of which can be found in the district court’s findings of fact, 220 F.Supp. at 71-72. Assuming, without deciding, that the record supports the district court’s quasi legal conclusion that Utility had “abandoned” its efforts in the area of reinforced plastics, Utility’s endeavors in this field prior to the perfection of Anderson’s apparatus are pertinent to the issue of obviousness and lack of invention in Anderson. The only apparent difference between the Utility device and that of Anderson is the lack of physical conjunction between the cutter and the spray gun in the former.\nAlthough certainly not exhaustive, the above describes, in substance, the status of the art prior to the culmination of Anderson’s efforts in 1952. The next step in our analysis is to determine exactly what Anderson did to improve upon prior art, since the fact of some improvement cannot be denied. Anderson seems to have been the first to mount a chopper between two nozzles emitting converging sprays of liquid. This elimination of separate cut down on glass waste. Moreover, the portability of this device apparently resulted in more flexibility, allowing wider areas of application, e. g., overhead fabrication or coating. Finally, this innovation would seem to effect a more thorough wetting of all fibers, with a resulting attainment of more uniform strength of the laminate.\nThe California district court correctly described the substance of Anderson’s case for improvement over the prior art as being “limited to the single point of the simultaneous, as distinguished from the previous two step, depositing of fiberglass roving with resin binder to form a reinforced plastic article.” Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, Inc., 223 F.Supp. 803, 809 (N.D.Calif.1963).\nHaving thus analyzed the status of the prior art and the extent of Anderson’s improvements thereupon, we must determine whether what Anderson did is properly classified as invention — subjecting Anderson ’125 to the “rather severe test” outlined by the Supreme Court in the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. case, supra. In our opinion, the district court focused its attention so heavily upon distinguishing in detail each individual apparatus from the Anderson ’125 that it failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the relevant prior art as it bears upon the issue of “obviousness” of the Anderson combination.\nWhile it is true that Anderson was the first to mount the chopper between converging sprays of liquid resin, he admitted that this use of the cutter in his apparatus “occurred to me the moment I saw the roving.” (Anderson deposition at 68-69). Prior to the availability of strands of fiberglass roving experimentally in 1950 or ’51, (Anderson deposition at 69-70), there were several references to the simultaneous deposition of already-cut body materials and liquid adhesives, e. g., Lampe, supra; Brennan, supra; McDonald, supra; Thompson, supra; Bacon, supra; Essman, supra. In addition, Anderson himself, dissatisfied with the fiberglass mats which he had been using as body material or molding, decided in 1951 to substitute, as a reinforcement, already chopped fibers which he planned to blow through a hose onto a form between two sprays of resin. However, before he had proceeded very far with this idea, he received his first samples of fiberglass strand roving and therefore turned his attention to cutting roving directly onto the mold and developing a cutter which could be placed between the two nozzles (Anderson deposition at 55-58, 63-64). Furthermore, Anderson admitted, that if a cutter were added to the Lampe process, supra, and the nozzles modified suitably, one would end up with a device similar to Anderson ’125 (Anderson deposition at 174). Regarding the cutter itself, although the Bacon and Essman prior art, supra, which utilized the Brenner and Turner type cutters, supra, were apparently not portable and thus not flexible enough for Anderson’s operation (Anderson deposition at 118-119), the Slayter device, supra, did embody this portability feature (Anderson deposition at 171-172). While Slayter allegedly was not a suitable cutter for Anderson’s purposes (Anderson deposition at 170-171), since the blades could not converge simultaneously, both the Bacon and Ess-man cutters were apparently adequate in this respect (Anderson deposition at 114-122).\nFrom this assemblage of the pri- or art, we conclude that the Anderson ’125 combination patent as a whole is lacking in “any unusual or surprising consequences from the unification of the elements here concerned.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. While we realize that the materials used in, and the end purposes of, the above references do not identically correspond to their counterparts in the field of reinforced plastics (but see Thompson, supra), we nevertheless conclude that they comprise the relevant prior art contemplated by 35 U.S.C.A. § 103, set out in full at note 2 supra. To place an imaginary barrier around the reinforced plastics field, and to limit the prior art which may be considered in determining “obviousness” under 35 U.S.C.A. § 103 accordingly, would not correspond to reality. Surely the mind of a person having ordinary skill in the field of reinforced plastics in 1951 was not so artificially circumscribed. Moreover, a ruling to the contrary would provide a stimulus to attempted patents upon mounted cutter-spray gun combinations in these analogous areas of simultaneous deposition. Such a result would be antithetical to the higher end which the Constitutional grant of monopolistic patent privilege was designed to serve — the advancement of science. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 154-154, 155, 71 S.Ct. 127 (Douglas, concurring) .\nTo summarize, the Anderson ’125 combines (1) the prior art process of simultaneously depositing pre-cut body material and binder, (2) the prior art roller-cutter device and (3) the prior art feature of portability. Nor do these old component elements “perform any additional or different function in the combination than they perform out of it. -x- * * Two and two have been added together, and still they make only four.” Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, 340 U.S. at 152, 71 S.Ct. at 130. We agree with the conclusion of the district court in Canadian Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Peterson Prods. of San Mateo, 223 P. Supp. 803, 814 (N.D.Calif.1963), that\n“patentable invention certainly cannot be held to consist in merely making a bracket to mount a cutter on a spray gun — a mechanical step that would be obvious to any mechanically skilled person who wanted to accomplish the simultaneous operation-in that manner rather than by holding the chopper and the spray gun separately.”\nOur conclusions are influenced by the relative youth of the fiberglass industry and especially by the fact that fiberglass roving in strands did not become available for experiment until approximately 1950. The efforts of Utility (abandoned or not) and Anderson, following so closely upon the availability of roving strands are indicative of the obviousness of the Anderson ’125 combination. Any other result would allow a person with ordinary skill in an art to sweep under the monopolistic protection of a patent the mechanical adaptation of new materials to the existing art.\nImplicit in our holding is a finding that any presumption of validity attached to the issuance of this patent has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, evidence which lies undisputed in the record of this case.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.

The order also required the removal of a website operated by the officers, which contained information and recordings that the court deemed to be prejudicial to the trial.\n\nIn reviewing the order, we must consider the prior restraint doctrine, which requires that the record establish a clear and present danger of prejudice sufficient to justify the restriction. As the court in Brown v. United States, 218 F.3d 415 (5th Cir. 2000), held, a prior restraint on speech is presumed to be unconstitutional, and the party seeking to impose the restraint must demonstrate a substantial likelihood of prejudice.\n\nHere, the court\'s order was based on the testimony of the parties, which suggested that they had made extra-judicial comments to the media and on the website. However, as the court in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), held, the mere fact that a party has made extra-judicial statements does not necessarily establish a nexus between the statements and the potential for prejudice to the jury venire.\n\nFurthermore, the court\'s order was not narrowly tailored to excise only those portions of the website that were likely to cause prejudice. Instead, it required the removal of the entire website, which is a broad and overbroad restriction on speech.\n\nIn conclusion, while the court\'s concern about prejudice to the trial is understandable, the order issued is not a narrowly tailored solution to that problem. In the absence of a clear and present danger of prejudice, the court\'s order is an unreasonable determination of the facts and is therefore unconstitutional. The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. \n\ncitations needed to make: [\'279 F.2d 41\', \'682 F.3d 400\']\n\ngold_text: In sum, the district court erred in concluding that the entirety of the Website was substantially likely to cause prejudice. Accordingly, the court’s determination that the entire Website “demonstrate^] a substantial likelihood of impacting the jury venire,” is overbroad and clearly erroneous. See Canal Ins. Co. v. Thornton, 279 F.2d 41, 43 (5th Cir.1960) (concluding that a district court’s determination was clearly erroneous when “there was no basis [in] the record” to support its finding); cf. Batchelor v. Cain, 682 F.3d 400, 413 (5th Cir.2012) (concluding that the state appellate court made an erroneous factual determination that a habeas petitioner waived his request to represent himself when “the record admitted] of no basis” to support the finding).

IV. In sum, we conclude that the trial court violated Batchelor’s Sixth Amendment right to represent himself by erroneously denying a clear and unequivocal assertion of that right. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a). We further conclude that Batchelor has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the state appellate court’s implicit finding that he waived his Faretta request was erroneous, see id. § 2254(e)(1), and that the state appellate court’s denial of Batchelor’s claim on direct appeal resulted from an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence in the state court record, see id. § 2254(d)(2). Therefore, § 2254(d) does not bar issuance of the writ. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of habeas relief. . McKaskle addressed the issue of “what role standby counsel who is present at trial over the defendant\'s objection may play consistent with the protection of the defendant’s Faretta rights.” 465 U.S. at 169, 104 S.Ct. 944. However, the "limits on the extent of standby counsel’s unsolicited participation” set forth in McKaskle, see id. at 177-82, 104 S.Ct. 944, are\n\nprevious_text: HAYNES, Circuit Judge:\nSeveral current and former officers in the Lafayette Police Department (“Officers”) appeal the district court’s grant of a protective order requiring, among other things, that a particular website they operate be “taken down” in its entirety, which was issued at the request of Appellees, officials and entities within the City of Lafayette Police Department (collectively, “Lafayette PD Defendants”). We VACATE in part and REMAND for further proceedings.\nI. Jurisdiction\nA prior motions panel of this court denied the Lafayette PD Defendants’ motion to dismiss this interlocutory appeal for want of jurisdiction. Although the Lafayette PD Defendants do not renew their jurisdictional arguments in their merits brief, we may consider whether we have appellate jurisdiction sua sponte at any time. See Save the Bay, Inc. v. U.S. Army, 639 F.2d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.1981) (“Because we may not proceed without requisite jurisdiction, it is incumbent upon federal courts trial and appellate to constantly examine the basis of jurisdiction, doing so on our own motion if necessary.” (emphasis added)).\nWe agree with the motions panel, concluding that we have jurisdiction pursuant to the collateral order doctrine, which provides appellate jurisdiction to review “a small set of prejudgment orders ... [1] that are conclusive, [2] that resolve important questions separate from the merits, and [3] that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.” Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 103-06, 130 S.Ct. 599, 175 L.Ed.2d 458 (2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have repeatedly found the doctrine applies in cases in which pre-trial orders arguably infringe on First Amendment rights. See In re Hearst Newspapers, L.L.C., 641 F.3d 168, 174 (5th Cir.2011); Davis v. E. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., 78 F.3d 920, 926 (5th Cir.1996). In United States v. Brown, 218 F.3d 415, 420-21 (5th Cir.2000), we concluded that we had jurisdiction to consider a criminal defendant’s pre-trial appeal of a gag order imposed by the district court on litigants in the case. We similarly conclude that we have appellate jurisdiction over the Officers’ challenge here.\nII. Facts and Background\nThe Officers sued under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988, alleging, inter alia, that the Lafayette PD Defendants imposed a “code of silence” to prevent police officers from reporting certain civil rights abuses and corruption within the Lafayette Police Department and that the Lafayette PD Defendants retaliated against them for objecting to these practices. Relevant here, the Officers communicated with the media concerning the case and maintained a website, www.realcopsvcraft.com (the “Website”), which contained: an image of the Lafayette Police Chief, a party in this suit; excerpts of critical statements made in the media concerning the Lafayette PD Defen dants; certain voice recordings of conversations between the Officers and members of the Lafayette Police Department; and other accounts of the Lafayette PD Defendants’ alleged failings. The Officers’ attorneys eventually transferred ownership of the website to one of the Officers.\nIn response to this publicity, the Lafayette PD Defendants sought a protective order seeking certain limits on communications with the media and removal of the Website. At the conclusion of the two-day hearing, the magistrate judge orally granted the Lafayette PD Defendants’ request to limit the trial participants’ communication with the media and public. The magistrate judge then entered a written order accompanied by a memorandum ruling.\nThe magistrate judge opined from the bench that “[t]he [Wjebsite ... is patently offensive on its face as a means of producing information rather than being an objective source of information supposedly created for the protection of the litigants.” In the subsequent written order, the magistrate judge\nordered that the parties’ and their attorneys’ contact and communication with and through the media shall be limited to (a) information contained in the public record; (b) identification of parties and claims/defenses asserted in this matter; (c) the scheduling or result of any step in this litigation; (d) references that investigation(s) is in progress, without disclosure of investigation details; (e) requests for assistance in obtaining evidence or information; (f) warnings of danger concerning the behavior of persons who are parties in this case when there is reason to believe, based on a reasonable factual inquiry, that there exists a likelihood of substantial harm to an individual or the public interest.\nThe magistrate judge “further ordered that the website www.realcopsvcraft.com shall be closed and removed immediately, ceasing all operations and publication, and that the recordings shall not be publicly disclosed outside the confines of this case and any other pending legal proceeding, absent leave of court.” The restrictions on communications with the media were expressly modeled on Louisiana Rule of Professional Conduct 3.6 and the language approved in Brown, 218 F.3d at 429-31, and Levine v. U.S. District Court, 764 F.2d 590, 598-99 (9th Cir.1985). The magistrate judge also “order[ed] the [Wjebsite be taken down” because it “not only con-tainted] comments and information that would violate [Louisiana Rule of Professional Conduct] 4.4, it is and has been used as a vehicle by which to disseminate inappropriate information to the media and the public.” The primary rationale for the order was to allow for a fair trial by avoiding a taint on the prospective jury pool. Over objection, the district court adopted the magistrate judge’s order, and this appeal followed.\nIII. Standard of Review\nWe review a district court’s grant of a protective order for abuse of discretion. Leatherman v. Tarrant Cnty. Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 28 F.3d 1388, 1394 (5th Cir.1994). The district court’s legal conclusions should be reviewed de novo, and its factual findings should not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. See United States v. Aldawsari, 683 F.3d 660, 664 (5th Cir.2012) (explaining that “[b]ecause [evaluating the validity of a gag order] involves constitutional and other legal questions, we review the district court’s orders de novo. Specific factual findings of the district court on the issue are, of course, entitled to review under the clearly erroneous standard.” (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). Importantly, however, “in eases raising First Amendment issues ... an appellate court has an obligation to ‘make an independent examination of the whole record’ in order to make sure that ‘the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.’ ” Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 499, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984) (quoting N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 284-86, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964)).\nIV. Discussion\nWhen restrictions are sought to be imposed on litigants after litigation is filed, a district court must balance a litigant’s First Amendment rights against other important, competing considerations. See Brown, 218 F.3d at 424 (“ ‘[Although litigants do not surrender their First Amendment rights at the courthouse door, those rights may be subordinated to other interests that arise’ in the context of both civil and criminal trials.” (quoting Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 32 n. 18, 104 S.Ct. 2199, 81 L.Ed.2d 17 (1984))). Court orders restricting trial participants’ speech are evaluated under the prior restraint doctrine, which requires that the record establish that the speech creates a potential for prejudice sufficient to justify the restriction. See Brown, 218 F.3d at 424-25. In addition, the restriction must be narrowly tailored and employ the least restrictive means of preventing the prejudice. Id. at 425. We note that the Officers represent that they are willing to accept the application to them of Louisiana Rules of Professional Responsibility 3.6 and 4.4 in this context, although those rules ordinarily would not apply to clients who are not lawyers. They object to the terms of the court’s order only as they support or apply to the portion of the order mandating that the Website be removed in its entirety. Thus, we focus our analysis only on the portion of the order addressing removal of the entire Website.\nWe begin by addressing the necessity of deferring to district courts in matters affecting the daily functioning of their courts. See, e.g., United States v. Gurney, 558 F.2d 1202, 1209 (5th Cir.1977) (“The trial judge is ... granted broad discretion in ordering the daily activities of his court.”). In a broader sense, considerable discretion is vested in district, courts in ensuring fair trials and avoiding a “circus atmosphere” or “chaos” that can be occasioned by unfettered aggression on the part of one or both sides in litigation. See United States v. Harrelson, 713 F.2d 1114, 1117 (5th Cir.1983) (explaining that district court judges possess “broad discretion, based on the law and on [their] common experience,” to ensure a fair and orderly trial). We respect and affirm the district court’s central role in this important process of securing a just and dignified trial proceeding.\nWe disagree, however, with the Lafayette PD Defendants’ implicit suggestion in their briefs (made explicit at oral argument) that the Officers have a complete “either or” choice between filing a lawsuit and exercising their First Amendment rights. This area, as the district court recognized, demands a nuanced approach to the delicate balance between the necessity of avoiding a tainted jury pool and the rights of parties to freely air their views and opinions in the “market square” now taking the form of the electronic square known as the Internet. The district court faithfully and carefully addressed numerous precedents surrounding the use of “gag orders” and applied a careful and nuanced approach in much of the challenged order. When it came to the Website, however, the nuanced approach gave way to a more wholesale striking of its entire content — indeed, the very website itself. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that this wholesale striking cannot stand in its current form.\nWe analyze this issue under the prior restraint doctrine. Court orders aimed at preventing or forbidding speech “are classic examples of prior restraints.” Alexander v. United States, 509 U.S. 544, 550, 113 S.Ct. 2766, 125 L.Ed.2d 441 (1993). Indeed, this court has recognized that “[d]espite the fact that litigants’ First Amendment freedoms may be limited in order to ensure a fair trial, gag orders ... still exhibit the characteristics of prior restraints.” Brown, 218 F.3d at 424; see also Levine, 764 F.2d at 595 (holding that a court’s order prohibiting trial participants from speaking to the media constituted a prior restraint). The order here explicitly restricts the expression of attorneys and parties in this litigation as it relates to the media and prevents the Officers from expression in the Website. As a result, the protective order qualifies as a prior restraint.\nPrior restraints “face a well-established presumption against their constitutionality.” Brown, 218 F.3d at 424-25 (citing Bernard v. Gulf Oil Co., 619 F.2d 459, 467 (5th Cir.1980) (en banc) (citations omitted)); see also Org. for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U.S. 415, 419, 91 S.Ct. 1575, 29 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971) (“Any prior restraint on expression comes ... with a ‘heavy presumption’ against its constitutional validity.”). We must therefore balance the First Amendment rights of trial participants with our “ ‘affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial publicity.’ ” Brown, 218 F.3d at 423 (quoting Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378, 99 S.Ct. 2898, 61 L.Ed.2d 608 (1979)); see also Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966) (“The courts must take such steps by rule and regulation that will protect their processes from prejudicial outside interferences.”).\nThe first step in assessing the constitutionality of a prior restraint requires considering whether the harm the court seeks to prevent justifies the restraint on speech. Brown, 218 F.3d at 425. In assessing restrictions on speech, courts have required that the record establish different levels of harm, including a “clear and present danger,” “substantial likelihood,” or “reasonable likelihood” of prejudice. We have not clearly delineated which standard applies to the parties (rather than the media) in civil litigation.\nIn Brown, we applied a substantial likelihood of prejudice test to both attorneys and parties in the context of a gag order applied in a criminal matter. 218 F.3d at 426 (noting that the Court in Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030, 111 S.Ct. 2720, 115 L.Ed.2d 888 (1991), “approved [a] ‘substantial likelihood’ standard when applied to gag orders imposed on attorneys, but did not mandate it as a constitutional minimum necessary to justify a judicially-imposed restriction on attorney speech”). As “[t]he Supreme Court has recognized that conflict between freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial is no less troubling in the non-criminal context,” we conclude that Brown represents the right balance for this civil case. See Bailey v. Sys. Innovation, Inc., 852 F.2d 93, 97 (3d Cir.1988); see also Brown, 218 F.3d at 424 (providing that an individual’s First Amendment rights may be limited by a court order “in the context of both civil and criminal trials ” (emphasis added)). As in criminal matters, civil cases also require avoiding “the potential that pretrial publicity may taint the jury venire, resulting in a jury that is biased toward one party or another,” Brown, 218 F.3d at 423, and preventing the “creat[ion] [of] “a ‘carnival atmosphere,’ which threatens the integrity of the proceeding.” Id. at 423 n. 8. Thus, we apply the Brown standard here.\nIn this case, the testimony during the two-day trial presents significant evidence that the trial participants made extra-judicial comments to the media and on the Website. For instance, Plaintiff Mar-ceaux testified that he had television interviews with two news stations, but he did not provide any newspaper interviews. This testimony, along with the testimony of the other seven witnesses, speaks to the trial participants’ propensity to make extra-judicial statements.\nIt does not, however, establish a nexus between the comments and the potential for prejudice to the jury venire through the entirety of the Website. It is not “narrowly tailored” to excising matters with a sufficient potential for prejudice to warrant prior restraint.\n\n\nOutput a valid JSON object with the fields of {"label": [(one or more integers from 0-3 indicating the gap categories, expressed in a list)], "explanation": a short explanation justifying the label.}.
